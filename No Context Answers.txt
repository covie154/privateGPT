Haemangiomas between 2 and 4 cm in diameter are most likely to

diagnosis.
MRI is the most sensitive and specific imaging examination for the 
diagnosis of haemangioma. Using extended echo time (e.g. TE of 120 to

in association with OP.
• Smoking-related interstitial lung diseases encompass involvement of several
