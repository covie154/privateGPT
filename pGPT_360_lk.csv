The lesion has hyperintense areas on T1 with signal drop-out on out-of-phase imaging. Areas of low T1 signal are also seen within the lesion. What is the most likely diagnosis? Select ONE answer only.","SBA: Genito urinary, Adrenal, Obstetrics & Gynaecology and Breast",Myelolipoma,Adrenal adenoma,Aldosterone secreting neuroendocrine tumour,Cortical carcinoma,Melanoma metastasis,A,65%,23%,6%,4%,2%,"Explanation:
Myelolipoma is a benign tumour with large areas of fat within. Only about Â¼ have calcification. On MRI, myeloid is seen as focal areas of low T1 signal. The lesions are present with retroperitoneal haemorrhage. They are associated with endocrine disorders, but do not cause them, such as Cushings and Conn's.
With any lesion on an MRI scan the key to diagnosis lies in determining the tissue content. Try to decide if a lesion contains fat, fluid, blood or all three by going through the tissue types one by one.
Each different sequence helps to eliminate/rule-in the different tissue types.
Blood - high on T1 and does not suppress on T1 fat saturated sequences (e.g. the precontrast sequence)
Fluid - high on T2. Compare with known fluid filled organs such as the bladder for pelvic scans and the gallbladder for upper abdominal scans. If the target lesion is fluid, it should not just be slightly high on T2 but should be as high as these reference organs.
Fat - high on T1 and does suppress on fat saturated sequences (macroscopic fat), or demonstrates chemical shift artefact on out of phase images (microscopic fat).

Adrenal adenomas are typically benign, well-defined, heterogeneous lesions that are predominantly echogenic on ultrasound and have hyperintense areas on T1 with signal drop-out on out-of-phase imaging. They also typically have areas of low T1 signal within the lesion. These features are consistent with the findings of the ultrasound and MRI scans described in the question.",2,,B,True,"I chose option 2, Myelolipoma, because the description of the lesion in the question is consistent with the characteristics of a myelolipoma. Myelolipomas are benign adrenal tumors that are predominantly composed of fat and bone marrow elements. 

The ultrasound scan showed a well-defined, heterogeneous but predominantly echogenic lesion, which suggests the presence of fat within the lesion. The MRI findings further support this diagnosis, as the lesion has hyperintense areas on T1-weighted imaging (indicative of fat content) and signal drop-out on out-of-phase imaging (which is a feature of fat-containing lesions). Additionally, areas of low T1 signal within the lesion could represent the bone marrow elements of a myelolipoma.

The other options are less likely based on the imaging findings described:

1. Adrenal adenomas typically have a more homogeneous appearance and do not usually have the fat content seen in this case.

MLO and CC are the standard views performed at screening.
If further view are required these are usually decided on a case-by-case basis.
  A true lateral view can help demonstrate suspected teacup calcifications are teacup calcifications. Compression views are used to interrogate suspicious calcifications seen on mammograms further.
A rolled CC view can help separate out structures to prove that the 'mass' seen on the original mammogram was a summation shadow, or to confirm the presence of a mass.
  Teacup calcifications
Teacup calcifications are caused by liquid milk of calcium within fibrocystic change. On mammography they appear as small curvilinear thin calcifications resembling the fluid level in a teacup on lateral views and rounded on a craniocaudal view, like a teacup viewed from above. Although teacup calcifications are typically benign in nature and suggestive of only fibrocystic changes they must be distinguished from suspicious calcifications. Thus, the best views for confirming the presence of teacup calcifications would be a true lateral, as opposed to an oblique lateral, and a CC view.",False,"I chose this answer because a rolled CC view is one of the basic screening views used in mammography.

Renal artery stenosis is known to be associated with Neurofibromatosis type 1, also known as von Recklinghausen disease.
There are three main aetiologies of renal artery stenosis. The most prevalent is atherosclerosis. Fibromuscular dysplasia is the second most common and is classically given as affecting a relatively young woman with beading (string of beads) of the mid and distal renal arteries seen, for which the management is angioplasty. Finally a small number of cases are secondary to a variety of conditions such as Buerger disease, Takayasu disease and neurofibromatosis.
The significance of diagnosis of atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis is in avoiding the use of ACE inhibitors. The ASTRAL trial showed that there was no long term benefit of stenting the stenoses over best medical management, although there was still a reduction in the number of episodes of flash pulmonary oedema experienced by the patients.",False,"Renal arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) are a known complication of von Recklinghausen disease (NF1). They are caused by an abnormal connection between the arteries and veins of the kidneys, which can lead to hypertension. This is the most likely explanation for the patientâs hypertension in this case.",2,"This question would fall under the category of clinical judgement, what is the correct diagnosis?",D,True,"I chose option 2, Renal artery stenosis, because von Recklinghausen disease, also known as Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), is a genetic disorder that affects the growth and development of nerve cell tissues. This can lead to the formation of benign tumors called neurofibromas, which can occur anywhere in the body, including the renal arteries.

Renal artery stenosis is a narrowing of the renal arteries, which supply blood to the kidneys. In patients with NF1, neurofibromas or other vascular abnormalities can cause compression or narrowing of the renal arteries, leading to renal artery stenosis. This can result in reduced blood flow to the kidneys, which in turn can cause hypertension (high blood pressure) as the kidneys release hormones to increase blood pressure in response to the decreased blood flow.

The other options are less likely to be associated with NF1 and hypertension:

1. Atherosclerosis: While it can cause hypertension, it is not specifically associated with NF1.
3. Renal AVMs: Arteriovenous malformations are rare in NF1 and not a common cause of hypertension in these patients.

Select ONE answer only.,SBA: Paediatrics,Cystic fibrosis,Type 1 diabetes,Type 2 diabetes,Traumatic amputation,Diabetes insipidus,A,88%,7%,1%,4%,1%,"Explanation:
Cystic fibrosis
An absent finding such as asplenia can be harder to detect than the presence of an abnormality. In cystic fibrosis the pancreatic parenchyma becomes entirely replaced by fatty infiltration to such an extent that it blends almost imperceptibly with the intra-abdominal fat and appears completely absent. Patients suffer from pancreatic failure and require high dose enzyme replacement.
  Distal Intestinal Obstruction Syndrome (DIOS)
The description of a bubbly area on an abdominal radiograph is more usually linked to meconium ileus. DIOS is also referred to as a meconium ileus equivalent as these two conditions are similar. In patients with cystic fibrosis the thicker-than-normal intestinal mucus, increase in transit time and pancreatic insufficiency all conspire to cause faecal impaction. This often occurs in early adolescence when parental control wears thin and concordance with medical management (in particular pancreatic enzyme replacement) of their cystic fibrosis can become an issue. Patients develop colicky right lower quadrant pain and tenderness when faecal matter obstructs around the terminal ileum. On x-ray this can sometimes be seen as a bubbly area close to where the caecum might be expected to be.",False,"The most likely diagnosis in this case is traumatic amputation. This is because the absence of the pancreas on the CT scan is most likely due to the trauma from the coach crash, which could have caused the pancreas to be completely or partially removed. Type 1 and type 2 diabetes, diabetes insipidus, and cystic fibrosis are all conditions that can affect the pancreas, but in this case, the absence of the pancreas is most likely due to the trauma of the crash.",2,,D,True,"I chose option 2, Cystic fibrosis, because it is a genetic disorder that can cause the pancreas to be underdeveloped or absent. In this case, the absence of the pancreas is not likely due to the trauma from the coach crash, as traumatic amputation would not affect the pancreas. Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes are related to insulin production and resistance, respectively, but do not cause the pancreas to be absent.

14407,201667,You are reviewing an MRI scan of a 45-year-old woman who recently underwent a successful uterine artery embolisation for management of menorrhagia. Which of the following is a complication of this procedure? Select ONE answer only.,SBA: Cardiothoracic and vascular,Ovarian dysfunction,Meig syndrome,Dermoid formation,Asherman syndrome,Endometrioma,A,85%,3%,1%,10%,2%,"Explanation:
Asherman syndrome
Historically this condition was the result of infection with tuberculosis but nowadays it is more often the consequence of iatrogenic endometrial damage. The formation of intrauterine synechiae leads to subfertility and these fibrous bands can be seen on HSG as filling defects and surface irregularity. Asherman syndrome should not occur following uterine artery embolisation.
In the world of interventional radiology, uterine fibroid embolisation is gaining momentum. The uterine artery arises from the internal iliac artery whereas the ovarian artery arises directly from the aorta and its branches have a corkscrew appearance on angiography. Anastomoses between the two arteries or the two sides exist in approximately 20% of patients. Patients should be counselled for the risk of ovarian dysfunction subsequent to the procedure and patients over the age of 45 are at particular risk. Pedunculated fibroids are said to be poor candidates for embolisation owing to their propensity to detach however the literature is slightly contradictory on this topic.
Following a successful embolisation the fibroid should undergo infarction and involution. On an MRI scan there will be high T1 signal with low T2 signal and no enhancement of the infarcted tissue post-contrast.
Complications include:
Infections (Endometritis, PID and TOA)
DVT / PE - due to compression of pelvic veins by enlarged uterus (therefore a complication of the underlying pathology as opposed to the procedure itself)
Ovarian dysfunction - increased risk >45years due to greater propensity for uterine-ovarian artery anastomoses. Careful examination of pre-procedure MR angiography images helps reduce this risk
Fibroid passage
Haemorrhage
Uterine necrosis - look for lack of endometrial enhancement
  Meig syndrome
This is a triad of an ovarian fibroma (usually, other ovarian tumours do cause it too), ascites and pleural effusions. A right sided pleural effusion is more common than the left. The underlying mechanism is unclear. Two possible explanations are that either the tumour irritates the peritoneum leading to a build-up of inflammatory fluid, or that histamine release alongside other chemicals and hormones causes vasodilation and fluid exudation that way.",False,"Asherman syndrome is a known complication of uterine artery embolisation, which is a procedure used to treat menorrhagia.

14155,201667,You are reviewing the images of a 78-year-old man. 2-years-ago he was diagnosed with bladder cancer but following resection and intravesical BCG therapy his recent scans have been clear. Of late he has been experiencing nocturia and wishes to undergo a TURP procedure. His pre-op MRI scan shows an enlarged prostate gland with diffusely low T2 signal affecting the whole gland. What is the most likely diagnosis? Select ONE answer only.,"SBA: Genito urinary, Adrenal, Obstetrics & Gynaecology and Breast",PI-RADS 5/5 prostate adenocarcinoma,Pi-RADS 5/5 prostate squamous cell carcinoma,Granulomatous prostatitis,Prostate abscess,Sarcoidosis,A,16%,2%,79%,1%,2%,"Explanation:
Even with a history of intravesical BCG therapy, prostate adenocarcinoma is more likely than granulomatous prostatitis. Biopsy confirmation is essential.
  Prostate cancer
The vast majority of cancers of the prostate are adenocarcinomas and the risk of developing prostate cancer increases with age to such an extent that by the age of 80 approximately 80% of men will have some neoplastic foci within the prostate although these may be completely occult and never manifest clinically.  Where the disease does advance it becomes one of the top three most common causes of death from cancer in men alongside lung cancer and colorectal cancer. Serum Prostatic Specific Antigen (PSA) levels have been used in prostate cancer screening since the 1990s.
  Gleason score - This is formed by identifying the most common cell morphology and second most common cell morphology. The different morphologies are compared to a five-point graded system and the two grades added together to give the final score (i.e. 4+2, 5+3 etc.). If there is only one cell morphology the score can be e.g. 3+3. Prostate cancer is defined by a minimum total grading of 6 (usually 3+3).
            MRI is crucial to provide accurate staging but is also gaining in momentum on its way to becoming a screening tool in its own right.
  The majority of prostate cancers arise from the peripheral zone and causes the normally high T2 signal to become low signal. Additionally the cancer should show restriction in diffusion (ie high signal on DWI, correspondingly low on ADC). It is important to view the T1 images as well in order to exclude the possibility of haemorrhage which can sometimes look like a prostate cancer on the T2 weighted images.
  Granulomatous prostatitis
This is an unusual condition which is said to develop following intravesical BCG therapy for bladder cancer. Other possible causes are sarcoidosis or tuberculous prostatitis. Aside from these, more recently purely idiopathic cases have also been noted. In these cases a recent UTI or urethral instrumentation have been implicated. The imaging appearances are reminiscent of a PI-RADS 5/5 prostate cancer and the diagnosis should always be made histologically. Whatever the aetiology, the patient followed up to resolution of imaging abnormalities to ensure a prostate cancer has not been masked.
Squamous cell carcinoma of the prostate accounts for very few prostate cancers. The majority are adenocarcinoma or transitional cell carcinoma.",False,"The most likely diagnosis based on the pre-op MRI scan is granulomatous prostatitis. This is because the MRI scan shows an enlarged prostate gland with diffusely low T2 signal, which is a sign of inflammation. Granulomatous prostatitis is an inflammatory condition of the prostate gland that is often associated with nocturia, which the patient is experiencing. Furthermore, the patient has already undergone resection and intravesical BCG therapy for bladder cancer, which could have caused the inflammation in the prostate gland.",2,,C,False,"I chose granulomatous prostatitis as the most likely diagnosis for the following reasons:

1. The patient has a history of bladder cancer and has undergone intravesical BCG therapy. BCG is a live, attenuated strain of Mycobacterium bovis that is used as an immunotherapy for bladder cancer. A known complication of this therapy is granulomatous prostatitis, which is an inflammatory condition of the prostate.

2. The MRI findings of an enlarged prostate gland with diffusely low T2 signal affecting the whole gland are consistent with granulomatous prostatitis. Inflammatory conditions, such as granulomatous prostatitis, can cause low T2 signal intensity due to increased cellularity and fibrosis.

3. While prostate adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma can also present with low T2 signal intensity, the patient's history of intravesical BCG therapy and the diffuse involvement of the entire prostate gland make granulomatous prostatitis a more likely diagnosis.

4. Prostate abscess and sarcoidosis are less likely given the patient's history and MRI findings. Prostate abscesses typically present with focal areas of low T2 signal intensity and peripheral enhancement, while sarcoidosis is a systemic disease that would likely have other manifestations beyond the prostate.

In summary, the patient's history of intravesical BCG therapy, the MRI findings of an enlarged prostate with diffusely low T2 signal intensity, and the clinical presentation make granulomatous prostatitis the most likely diagnosis.",C,True,A,False,"[{""page_content"": ""278 Genitourinary, Adrenal, Obstetrics and Gynaecology and Breast\nUS\n\u25cf\u25cf\nEnlarged prostate (>30 mL), signs of bladder outflow obstruction (BOO) (e.g. \ntrabeculated bladder, post-micturition residual bladder volume)\nCT\n\u25cf\u25cf\nEnlarged gland, may be calcified or have areas of cystic degeneration\n\u25cf\u25cf\nThickened, trabeculated bladder\nMRI\n\u25cf\u25cf\nSmall foci of T2 hyperintensity in the central zone\n\u25cf\u25cf\nLarge gland\nINTERVENTION\n\u25cf\u25cf\nProstate artery embolisation increasingly considered for selected patients not"", ""metadata"": {""source"": ""source_documents\\Vincent Helyar, Aidan Shaw - The Final FRCR_ Complete Revision Notes-CRC Press (2018).pdf"", ""file_path"": ""source_documents\\Vincent Helyar, Aidan Shaw - The Final FRCR_ Complete Revision Notes-CRC Press (2018).pdf"", ""page"": 286, ""total_pages"": 483, ""format"": ""PDF 1.5"", ""title"": ""The Final FRCR: Complete Revision Notes"", ""author"": ""Vincent Helyar and Aidan Shaw"", ""subject"": """", ""keywords"": """", ""creator"": ""Adobe InDesign CC (Windows)"", ""producer"": ""Adobe PDF Library 10.0.1"", ""creationDate"": ""D:20170918203950+05'30'"", ""modDate"": ""D:20170922154202+05'30'"", ""trapped"": """"}}, {""page_content"": ""114\nModule 4: Genitourinary, adrenal, obstetrics & gynaecology and breast\n7. \nA 60-year-old man with elevated PSA and a Gleason 4+3 \ntumour undergoes investigation with MRI of the prostate. \nWhich is the single best answer?\n \nA.

Myasthenia Gravis is a muscular condition where there is increased fatiguability of all muscles. The effect can be seen with the ocular muscles particularly well. The optic nerves are unaffected.
Glaucoma occurs when the pressures within the eye are greater than normal. This increased pressure damages the optic nerve and, without treatment, can lead to irreversible optic neuropathy and thereafter optic atrophy.
Optic neuritis is inflammation of the optic nerve and can occur in the context of multiple sclerosis, or in isolation. Like glaucoma, it can progress to neuropathy and atrophy.
Neuromyelitis optica is a specific condition, with similarities to multiple sclerosis, where there is optic neuritis. Usually patients have enlarged optic nerves, but chronic damage leads to optic atrophy.",True,"Myasthenia gravis is a neuromuscular disorder that causes muscle weakness, but it does not cause optic atrophy. Optic atrophy is a condition that occurs when the optic nerve is damaged, and it can be caused by Neuromyelitis optica, Neuritis, Multiple Sclerosis, and Chronic Glaucoma.",1,This question falls under basic factual recall.,E,True,"I chose Myasthenia gravis as the answer because it is not a cause of optic atrophy. Myasthenia gravis is an autoimmune disorder that affects the neuromuscular junction, leading to muscle weakness and fatigue. It primarily affects the voluntary muscles, including those that control eye movement and eyelid function. However, it does not cause optic atrophy, which is the damage and degeneration of the optic nerve.

Acromegaly
Excess circulating growth hormone can be caused either by a pituitary adenoma (>90%) or hyperplasia of the anterior pituitary. If this occurs prior to skeletal maturation it leads to gigantism in children. Thereafter there are a number of skeletal manifestations. Some of the most widely known are prognathism and spade-like hands.
Famously, the actor Richard Kiel who played Jaws in the James Bond films âMoonrakerâ and âThe Spy Who Loved Meâ had acromegaly.
Other important characteristics to look for are as follows:
Enlargement of the paranasal sinuses â 75%
Posterior vertebral scalloping â 30%
Widening of the terminal tufts
Heel pad thickness >25mm
Premature osteoarthritis
Enlargement and erosion of the sella
Hyperostosis of the inner table of the skull",False,"I chose this answer because hook-like osteophytes are a common symptom of acromegaly, which is characterized by an enlargement of the sella and paranasal sinuses. Hook-like osteophytes are bony projections that form on the second and third metacarpal heads, which are located on the hands.

This can result in various skeletal abnormalities, including posterior vertebral scalloping, which refers to the concave appearance of the posterior aspect of the vertebral bodies.

12576,201667,A 45-year-old man from Mexico is brought in by his wife who says he is not himself. He is found to have focal neurology and undergoes imaging. There are tiny calcified structures in the soft tissues surrounding his hip and on MRI scanning of his head oedema surrounding a focal lesion can be seen. What is the most likely diagnosis?,SBA: Central Nervous and Head & Neck,Neurocysticercosis,Metastatic osteosarcoma,Metastatic chondroblastoma,Cryptococcus,Cytomegalovirus,A,86%,7%,4%,2%,1%,"Explanation:
Neurocysticercosis
Cysticercosis is caused by a tapeworm native to low income countries and carried by pigs. Cysts calcify over time. In the skeletal muscle these can be seen on plain radiographs as ârice grainâ calcifications. CNS infection with cysticercosis is termed neurocysticercosis and is well described in the literature.
  Cytomegalovirus â this is a neonatal infection or one of the immunocompromised. Periventricular cysts and calcifications develop.
  Cryptococcus
This is an opportunistic yeast-like fungus which therefore requires a degree of immunocompromise, typically AIDS. The cryptococcomas are non-enhancing low density lesions in the basal ganglia. A granulomatous meningitis can also occur. They can be differentiated from VR spaces on FLAIR where VR spaces will suppress (being CSF in content) whereas the mucoid cryptococcomas will not.
  Metastatic chondrosarcoma or osteosarcoma â Metastases from osteosarcomas can show calcification (this can present as a pneumothorax secondary to lung metastases). Chondrosarcomas are cartilaginous forming tumours although rings and arcs of calcification are a feature.",True,Neurocysticercosis is the most likely diagnosis because it is the most common cause of focal neurologic deficits in patients from Mexico. The calcified structures in the soft tissues surrounding the hip and the oedema surrounding the focal lesion on MRI are both signs of neurocysticercosis.,2,,A,True,"I chose option 1, Neurocysticercosis, because the patient's presentation and imaging findings are consistent with this diagnosis. Neurocysticercosis is a parasitic infection of the central nervous system caused by the larval stage of the pork tapeworm, Taenia solium. It is more common in areas with poor sanitation and in people who have traveled to or are from endemic regions, such as Mexico.

The patient's focal neurology and the presence of edema surrounding a focal lesion on MRI scanning of his head suggest an intracranial process. The tiny calcified structures in the soft tissues surrounding his hip also point towards a systemic parasitic infection. These calcifications are often seen in cysticercosis, as the larvae form cysts in various tissues, which can later calcify.

The other options are less likely based on the provided information:
2. Metastatic osteosarcoma: This is a type of bone cancer that typically affects younger individuals and would not typically present with focal neurology and calcified structures in soft tissues.
3. Metastatic chondroblastoma: This is a rare benign bone tumor, and the presentation does not match the patient's symptoms and findings.
4. Cryptococcus: This is a fungal infection that can affect the central nervous system, but it does not typically cause calcified structures in soft tissues.

Thereafter he is taken to A+E for x-rays. No fracture is seen but, as he is unable to fully weight bear, he is provided with a set of crutches and discharged. Two weeks later he receives an MRI scan through his teamâs medical care plan as he still has ongoing pain. The radiologist reports high signal on STIR sequences at the anterolateral femoral condyle as well as the medial facet of the patella. The medial patella retinaculum is also torn. What is the most likely diagnosis?",SBA: Musculoskeletal and Trauma,Transient patella dislocation,Pivot shift injury,Hyperextension injury,Clip injury,OâDonoghue triad,A,91%,3%,2%,2%,2%,"Explanation:
Bony contusions
Bruising to the bone can be detected around 2 days following an injury but may not resolve for many months thereafter. With regards knee injuries, it is often possible to discern the mechanism of injury from the pattern of bruising seen. The contusions follow fluid on MRI scans i.e. low in signal on T1 and high on T2 (and STIR). STIR is used to suppress the fat of the bone marrow thereby making the fluid stand out more.
  Transient lateral patella dislocation injury
When the patella dislocates laterally, its medial facet can impact onto the anterolateral corner of the lateral femoral condyle. Both areas become damaged and contusions can be seen on MRI. Often though, the patella reduces spontaneously and thus the exact mechanism of injury must be inferred from the imaging findings.
Joint effusion
Osteochondral injuries to the anterolateral femoral condyle and medial patella facet
Sprain or disruption to the medial retinaculum
  Hyperextension injury
These occur often following excessively forceful kicking. There will be bony contusions at the anterior aspect of the tibial plateau and femoral condyles. Either of the anterior or posterior cruciate ligaments may also be involved.
  Clip injury and pivot shift injury
These two injuries are very similar. Both involve valgus stress on a flexed knee (such as a tackle to the knee during sports). A pivot shift injury also requires external rotation of the tibia. The three main structures most at risk during these injuries are:
Anterior cruciate ligament (especially in a pivot shift injury)
Medial collateral ligament (especially in a clip injury)
Medial meniscus (remember that the medial meniscus is attached to the medial collateral ligament)
If all three are present together it is referred to as the OâDonoghue triad. Since OâDonoghue defined this triad however, it has been discovered that lateral meniscal tears are actually more common with this type of injury than medial meniscus ones.
Bony contusions occur at the side of impact because the proximal tibia and distal femur impact on one another thus:
Lateral tibial plateau (posterolateral in pivot shift injury)
Lateral femoral condyle",True,"I chose number 3, Transient Patella Dislocation, because the MRI scan showed high signal on STIR sequences at the anterolateral femoral condyle and the medial facet of the patella, as well as a torn medial patella retinaculum. These findings are consistent with a transient patella dislocation, which is a common injury in sports. It typically occurs when the knee is forced into a position of extreme hyperextension, causing the kneecap to become dislocated.",2,,B,True,"I chose option 3, transient patella dislocation, because the MRI findings are consistent with this diagnosis. The high signal on STIR sequences at the anterolateral femoral condyle and medial facet of the patella indicates bone contusions or edema, which are commonly seen in patella dislocations.

On examination your A+E colleague notes mucocutaneous pigmentation in addition to generalised abdominal tenderness. He undergoes a small bowel follow through on which an ileo-ileal intussusception is diagnosed. There are multiple filling defects in the small bowel. What is the unifying diagnosis?,SBA: Gastrointestinal,Peutz-Jegher syndrome,Turcot syndrome,Cowden syndrome,Gardner syndrome,Familial Adenomatous Polyposis,A,92%,1%,2%,2%,3%,"Explanation:
Polyposis syndromes â intussusception is a significant risk
  Peutz-Jegher syndrome
Around half of cases are inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion but the rest are sporadic mutations to a tumour-suppressing gene on chromosome 11.  Innumerable hamartomatous polyps develop throughout the gastrointestinal tract. For a firm diagnosis there should be at least 100 polyps but usually there are far more. In the large bowel the polyps can be larger and more pedunculated, putting the patient at risk of intussusceptions. Patients are also at greater risk of many different cancers (upper GI, ovary, thyroid, testis, pancreas, breast). Mucocutaneous pigmentation is classic.
  Turcot syndrome
This is a subtype of Familial Adenomatous Polyposis (FAP) and inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion. The polyps are adenomatous and largely colonic. They are subject to the adenoma-carcinoma sequence and thus most patients develop cancer before the reach 40 years of age. Brain tumours are also part of this disease; supratentorial glioblastomas or medulloblastomas. A patient with diarrhoea and seizures would be a typical scenario in which Turcot syndrome is diagnosed.
  Cowden syndrome
This is a rare hamartomatous syndrome which is inherited as an autosomal dominant defect on chromosome 10. The polyps are predominantly (but not exclusively) in the rectosigmoid colon. There is an association with fibrocystic disease and fibroadenomas of the breast; around half of patients have breast pathology. There is a specific association with dysplastic cerebellar gangliocytoma also known as Lhermitte-Duclos disease. Patients with Cowden syndrome also develop skin lesions on the head and face called trichilemmomas which resemble tiny basal cell carcinomas.
  Gardner syndrome
This is a subtype of Familial Adenomatous Polyposis (FAP) and is a triad of colonic polyps, osteomas of the membranous skeleton (skull, maxilla, mandible) and soft tissue tumours such as desmoid tumours of the mesentery, lipomas, fibromas, keloid scarring. Many patients have supernummary teeth and dental caries requiring significant dental work at an early age.
  Familial Adenomatous Polyposis (FAP)
The polyps in FAP are said to resemble a carpet since they are so numerous. There are invariably colonic adenomatous polyps and around half of patients have stomach hamartomas too and a quarter of patients have duodenal adenomas. Patients usually undergo a prophylactic total colectomy and thereafter the greatest risk is of a periampullary carcinoma.

 ",False,"Familial Adenomatous Polyposis (FAP) is a genetic disorder characterized by the formation of numerous polyps in the large intestine. It is the most common cause of ileo-ileal intussusception, which is a condition in which one part of the intestine slides into another. Additionally, FAP is associated with mucocutaneous pigmentation and multiple filling defects in the small bowel, which are both symptoms that the patient in this scenario is exhibiting. Therefore, the unifying diagnosis is Familial Adenomatous Polyposis.",2,,E,True,"I chose Peutz-Jegher syndrome as the unifying diagnosis because the presented symptoms and findings align with the classic features of this condition. Peutz-Jegher syndrome is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder characterized by the development of noncancerous growths called hamartomatous polyps in the gastrointestinal tract, particularly in the small intestine, which can lead to intussusception, as mentioned in the case. 

Additionally, Peutz-Jegher syndrome is associated with mucocutaneous pigmentation, which typically presents as dark blue or brown spots on the lips, inside the mouth, and around the eyes, nose, or anus. These pigmented spots are another key feature of the syndrome mentioned in the case.

The other options, such as Turcot syndrome, Cowden syndrome, Gardner syndrome, and Familial Adenomatous Polyposis, do not present with the combination of intussusception, multiple filling defects in the small bowel, and mucocutaneous pigmentation, making Peutz-Jegher syndrome the most fitting diagnosis.",A,False,C,True,"[{""page_content"": ""Gastrointestinal system\n50\n3.

  Vascular malformations
There have, historically, been a few different classification systems used to organise vascular anomalies. The most straightforward of these is detailed below.

  Orbital cavernous haemangiomas
These are slow growing, solid vascular masses, similar in nature to other cavernous haemangiomata around the rest of the body. They enhance with contrast and dynamic contrast sequences, if performed, can show the usual gradual 'filling in' phenomenon. Orbital haemangiomas will displace surrounding structures, rather than invading them and pressure effects on adjacent bone can lead to remodelling. On T1 weighted images a dark pseudocapsule may be seen but otherwise the lesion will be isointense to muscle. On T2 weighted images haemangiomas are high in signal.",False,"I chose number 5, Filling-in phenomenon, because an orbital haemangioma does not cause a filling-in phenomenon.

11901,201667,An adolescent boy suffers a seizure midway through a test at school. He undergoes an MRI scan which shows a mass in the periphery of his right temporal lobe. There are a number of cysts but the lesion causes no oedema and displays no enhancement. What is the diagnosis?,SBA: Paediatrics,DNET,Schizencephaly,Ganglioglioma,PNET,Astrocytoma,A,65%,2%,13%,14%,5%,"Explanation:
A DNET (Dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumour) should be relatively simple diagnosis to make on paper. The patient will be youngish, with a temporal lobe lesion (in fact approximately a third are frontal lobe lesions), a history of epilepsy (often refractory) and the lesion is described as bubbly â here given as multiple cysts. The lack of oedema or enhancement is also typical.
Gangliogliomas are known to cause refractory temporal seizures, temporal lobe epilepsy in particular.  The usually enhance and also have a cystic component but these tumours can also show no enhancement post contrast. (Lack of enhancement is a feature much more classical to DNET though.) Furthermore although gangliogliomas can be cystic, the description of multiple cysts given in the question plays into the âbubblyâ texture of DNETs which is the usual description proffered.
Schizencephaly is a congenital abnormality consisting of a cleft extending from the ventricles to the subarachnoid space.
A PNET (primitive neuroectoderm tumour) shares little with a DNET besides the similarity in their acronyms. The age range for PNET is quoted as <5 years. They can show cystic features but the other features described are far more classical for DNET.
The term PNET is historical as these tumours are now described as Embryonal Tumours with Multilayered Rosettes (ETMR). 
Astrocytomas are the most common brain tumour in children. Although they also do not show significant oedema or enhancement they are usually located in the posterior fossa.",True,"DNET stands for Dysembryoplastic Neuroepithelial Tumor, which is a type of tumor that is commonly found in the temporal lobe. It is characterized by cysts and lesions that typically do not cause oedema or display enhancement on an MRI scan. Therefore, it is the most likely diagnosis in this case.",2,,D,True,"I chose DNET (Dysembryoplastic Neuroepithelial Tumor) because the MRI findings described in the question are consistent with this diagnosis. DNET is a benign, slow-growing brain tumor that often occurs in the temporal lobe and is commonly associated with seizures in children and adolescents.

10281,201667,"A 40-year-old man develops dyspnoea and general malaise and presents to A&E. On examination he has pitting oedema to his feet, a heart murmur on auscultation and distension of his neck veins. A CXR shows bilateral pleural effusions. The A&E doctor is worried he might have an aortic dissection, so he undergoes a CT scan. This shows, among other things, flattening of the right ventricle with curvature of the interventricular septum to the left. What is the diagnosis?",SBA: Cardiothoracic and vascular,Pericarditis,Aortic dissection type A,Aortic dissection type B,Lobar pulmonary emboli,Aortic coarctation,A,62%,7%,1%,27%,4%,"Explanation:
Pericarditis
Inflammation of the pericardium is termed pericarditis and leads to fibrous thickening. Most commonly this occurs either post-operatively in patients undergoing cardiac surgery or as an idiopathic entity although historically it was tuberculosis which was the most common cause of pericarditis. The diagnosis is predominantly clinical with symptoms such as malaise or dyspnoea and signs such as neck vein distension or paradoxical movement of the JVP. On cross sectional imaging thickening of the pericardium to greater than 2mm can be seen and the fibrosis causes a restriction in distensibility. The right ventricle, being more compliant than the left, becomes flattened and furthermore there can be curvature of the septum towards the left. Elsewhere, if the field of view permits, accessory signs such as pleural effusions and even ascites may be seen.
  Pulmonary Emboli
There is some cross-over of the signs and symptoms of pericarditis and a large lobar embolus. On CT, if the embolus is large enough to cause right ventricular strain the septum can sometimes appear bowed with reflux of IV contrast into the hepatic veins.
  Aortic dissection
Dissections are classified according to their involvement of the aortic root and their distal extent. There are two different classification systems. The Stanford classification is more useful clinically since the primary decision post-diagnosis is whether the dissection will be managed surgically or medically. Those involving the proximal aorta and arch are managed surgically. If the arch is not involved, the patient can be managed medically. Thus Stanford A dissections involve the aorta proximal to the origin of the left subclavian artery with or without concurrent distal involvement. Stanford B dissections do not involve the proximal aorta. Where a dissection extends proximally and causes pericardial tamponade the clinical signs and symptoms may well occur, however the presence of effusions and pitting oedema do not fit with the correct answer being aortic dissection.
  Coarctation
A congenital narrowing of the aorta at the level of the ductus arteriosus is known as coarctation. This can present neonatally when the point of stenosis is preductal. This means the body and lower limbs are supplied primarily via a patent ductus arteriosus. When coarctation presents later, even in adulthood, the point of stenosis is usually post-ductal with established collateralization via the subclavian and intercostals arteries. It is this collateral pathway which gives rise to the rib notching seen on a CXR.
Rib notching is due to chronic bony remodeling and it takes until around the age of 20 for it to become radiologically evident. Of note the intercostals arteries to the first and second ribs arise from the costocervical trunk and therefore the first and second ribs do not show rib notching. Furthermore should the patient have an aberrant right subclavian artery (ARSCA) as well as coarctation they will only demonstrate rib notching on the left side since the ARSCA originates distal to the stenotic point.
The other specific CXR sign associated with coarctation is the âfigure of 3â sign which refers to the contour of the descending aorta.
Coarctation of the aorta, like most of the other congenital cardiovascular abnormalities, has the usual sprinkling of associations. At least half of patients have a bicuspid aortic valve. As well as PDAs, VSDs are also common. There is a particular association with Turner syndrome (45, XO) (which often features in medical school finals questions.)",False,"I chose this option because the symptoms and findings described in the question are consistent with aortic dissection type A. The patient has pitting oedema in his feet, a heart murmur on auscultation, distension of neck veins, and a CT scan that shows flattening of the right ventricle with curvature of the interventricular septum to the left. These findings are all consistent with aortic dissection type A.",2,,B,False,"I chose option 3, Lobar pulmonary emboli, because the patient's symptoms and CT scan findings are consistent with this diagnosis. 

Dyspnea, general malaise, pitting edema, and bilateral pleural effusions are all indicative of a possible pulmonary embolism, as it can cause increased pressure in the pulmonary circulation, leading to fluid accumulation and edema. Additionally, the CT scan finding of flattening of the right ventricle with curvature of the interventricular septum to the left is a sign of right ventricular strain, which is commonly seen in cases of significant pulmonary embolism. This is due to the increased pressure in the pulmonary arteries causing the right side of the heart to work harder to pump blood through the lungs.

The other options are less likely based on the given information:

1. Aortic dissection type A: This would typically present with severe chest pain and may have a widened mediastinum on CXR. The CT scan findings mentioned do not support this diagnosis.

2. Aortic dissection type B: Similar to type A, this would present with chest or back pain and may have a widened mediastinum on CXR. The CT scan findings mentioned do not support this diagnosis.

4. Pericarditis: This condition would typically present with chest pain that is relieved by sitting up and leaning forward, and there may be a pericardial friction rub on auscultation. The CT scan findings mentioned do not support this diagnosis.

He recently returned from a gap year and is worried that his new naval piercing, done abroad, is infected. The GP requests an ultrasound scan which shows a tubular fluid filled structure in the anterior abdominal wall. What is the most likely diagnosis?","SBA: Genito urinary, Adrenal, Obstetrics & Gynaecology and Breast",Remnant cyst,Seminal vesicle cyst,Cystic prostate cancer,Mullerian duct cyst,Prostatic utricle cyst,A,95%,0%,0%,3%,1%,"Explanation:
Anatomy plays a strong role in the correct diagnosis of male genitourinary tract cysts. It is first necessary to differentiate between intraprostatic cysts and extraprostatic cysts.
  Urachal cyst (extraprostatic)
The urachus is a fibrous remnant of a thin canal connecting the bladder to the umbilicus. Ordinarily it is almost imperceptible however there are four distinct anomalies which can persist into adulthood and cause symptoms.
Patency â a fistula between the bladder and the umbilicus. There is leakage of urine from the umbilicus present from birth.
Sinus â blind dilatation of the urachus at the umbilical end.
Diverticulum â communication with the dome of the bladder
Cyst â dilatation in the lower third which does not communicate with either end. These are asymptomatic unless or until the cyst becomes infected or ruptures.
Malignancy arising from the urachas, unlike most bladder cancer, tends to be adenocarcinoma. In young patients sarcomas are also seen.
  Mullerian duct cyst (intraprostatic)
These are usually found in young adult men and are also caused by incomplete regression of the Mullerian duct. They have numerous similarities with prostatic utricle cysts, although the latter is associated with other congenital anomalies whereas Mullerian duct cysts are, classically, not. Anatomically they are also posterior to the bladder however unlike prostatic utricle cysts they extend superiorly to the prostate and do not communicate with the urethra. On MRI they appear straightforwardly cystic unless complicated by infection. The shape of the cyst is said to be teardrop shaped rather than the pear shaped prostatic utricle cysts.

  Prostatic utricle cyst (intraprostatic)
These are found in teenagers or adolescents and represent incomplete regression of the Mullerian duct system during embryological development. They are found posterior to the bladder, within the prostate, and do not extend any more superiorly than the superior most aspect of the prostate. This anatomical detail and the fact that the cyst does communicate with the prostatic urethra sets it apart from a Mullerian duct cyst on imaging. They can cause all manner of lower urinary tract symptoms and boast an association with ipsilateral renal agenesis as well as intersex disorders. On MRI they are said to have a pear shaped appearance.
  Seminal vesicle cyst (extraprostatic)
Seminal vesicle cysts form due to stenosis or atresia of the ejaculatory ducts and can be post-infective in nature or congenital. They tend to present in adolescence due to the increase in secretions around this time. Acquired cysts are seen later on in life. The signal characteristics on MRI are variable depending on the presence or absence of haemorrhage. Anatomically it should be easy to pinpoint their location as relating to the seminal vesicles, namely posterior to the bladder and superior to the prostate. Congenital seminal vesicle cysts are associated with renal anomalies and adult polycystic kidney disease.
  Cystic prostate cancer
Carcinoma of the prostate does not usually present as a cystic mass but the presence of haemorrhage within a cystic mass should raise the possibility of malignancy. Most prostate cancer arises from the peripheral zone and is seen as low T2 signal with restriction of diffusion. Cystic prostate cancer will return high signal on T2. The main differential diagnosis is a prostatic abscess.",True,"I chose this answer because a remnant cyst is the most common type of cyst found in the anterior abdominal wall, and it is often associated with umbilical piercings. It is typically filled with a thin watery fluid, which matches the patient's symptoms. In addition, it is a benign cyst, so it does not pose a risk of cancer.",2,,D,True,"I chose option 5, a remnant cyst, because the patient's presentation and ultrasound findings are consistent with this diagnosis. The patient has a thin watery discharge coming from his umbilicus, which suggests a connection between the umbilicus and the fluid-filled structure seen on ultrasound. This points to a remnant of the embryonic development, such as an urachal cyst or sinus, rather than an issue with the reproductive system (options 1-4).

Urachal remnants are relatively rare but can occur when a portion of the embryonic urachus fails to close completely during development. This can result in a fluid-filled structure, such as a cyst or sinus, that may be connected to the umbilicus. In this case, the patient's recent naval piercing could have potentially irritated or introduced an infection to the area, leading to his current symptoms.",A,False,B,True,"[{""page_content"": ""The most likely diagnosis is?\n(a) Medullary nephrocalcinosis\n(b) Renal cortical necrosis\n(c) Papillary necrosis\n(d) Acute pyelonephritis\n(e) Acute interstitial nephritis\n8.

Vertebral haemangioma
These lesions are extremely common and should be very familiar to all candidates. They can occur anywhere but commonly arise in the vertebrae.

On MRI they return high signal on both T1 and T2 sequences.
  Metastatic malignant melanoma
This is the exception that proves the rule. Apart from metastatic malignant melanoma, all other skeletal lesions which return high signal on T1 are benign. The melanin pigment has paramagnetic effects and leads to high T1 signal. On top of this melanoma metastases have a high propensity to haemorrhage which can also produce high T1 signals.

13864,201667,You review an MRI scan of a 50-year-old patient with carpal tunnel syndrome. The floor of the carpal tunnel is formed by which of the following? Select ONE answer only.,SBA: Musculoskeletal and Trauma,The carpal arch,The palmar carpal ligament,The palmar aponeurosis,The extensor retinaculum,The flexor retinaculum,A,76%,3%,6%,3%,13%,"Explanation:
The carpal tunnel is a passageway on the palmar side of the wrist that connects the forearm to the middle compartment of the deep plane of the hand.
The carpal tunnel is formed by two layers, the carpal arch and the flexor retinaculum:
1. The carpal arch forms the floor of the carpal tunnel. It is concave on the palmar side and is formed laterally by the scaphoid and trapezium tubercles and medially by the hook of the hamate and the pisiform bones.
2. The flexor retinaculum forms the roof of the carpal tunnel. It is a strong, fibrous band that covers the carpal bones on the palmar side of the hand near the wrist. It is attached medially to the pisiform bone and the hook of the hamate bone. Laterally it attaches to the tubercle of the scaphoid bone, and to the medial part of the trapezium bone.

Questions on post-procedure complications are relatively easy to write.
For lung biopsy there are a few key statistics that are important to know.
  Approximate statistics
Pneumothorax of any size
25%
Pneumothorax needing chest drain insertion
5-10%
Haemoptysis
3%
Air embolus

  Contraindications to CT guided lung biopsy are:
Severe COPD
Pulmonary hypertension
Coagulopathy       
PLT <50
INR >1.4
Contralateral pneumonectomy
(echinococcal cysts)
  Various details regarding technique can also be asked:
Make the incision âjust above the rib belowâ to avoid the main neurovascular bundle
Avoid crossing fissures where possible.
A coaxial needle is best â an FNA should only be used if there is a cryopathologist on-site for immediate evaluation but since the complication rate between FNA and coaxial biopsies is largely the same this is of little consequence.
Oxygen saturations must be monitored throughout.
The CT images should be taken under breath-holding
Most cases can be done as day cases unless complications arise or are predicted.",True,"Pneumothorax is the most common complication following a lung biopsy.

A left branch retinal artery occlusion would give a left-sided hemianopia or quadrantanopia.
A right PCA infarction would give a homonymous defect (on the left).
A left PCA infarction might cause a homonymous defect (on the right).
Meningiomas are usually slow growing and incidentally discovered. This would be a very unusual presentation of a meningioma.",False,"The most likely cause for a quadrantanopia of the left eye is a branch retinal artery occlusion in the left eye. This is because the branch retinal artery occlusion affects the blood supply to the retina, leading to a decrease in vision in the affected area. The other options are all causes of neurological deficits, which would not cause a decrease in vision in the affected area.",2,"3. A question about interpreting clinical findings or laboratory results?

2. A question about clinical judgement, what is the correct diagnosis?",A,False,"I chose option 3, ""Right posterior cerebral artery (PCA) territory infarction,"" because a quadrantanopia (a visual field defect affecting one-quarter of the visual field) in the left eye is most likely due to a lesion in the contralateral (opposite side) visual pathway. In this case, the left eye is affected, so the lesion is likely to be on the right side of the brain. 

The posterior cerebral artery (PCA) supplies blood to the occipital lobe, which is responsible for processing visual information. An infarction in the right PCA territory could lead to damage in the right occipital lobe, affecting the left visual field and causing the quadrantanopia in the left eye. 

The other options are less likely to cause this specific visual field defect:

1. Left PCA territory infarction would affect the right visual field.
2. Left posterior parafalcine meningioma is a tumor and would not specifically target the visual pathway.
4. Right posterior parafalcine meningioma is also a tumor and would not specifically target the visual pathway.

Which is the most likely diagnosis?,SBA: Central Nervous and Head & Neck,Lewy Body Dementia,Alzheimer's disease,Parkinson's disease,Pick's disease,Huntington's disease,A,76%,11%,4%,6%,3%,"Explanation:
These findings are classical for Lewy Body dementia, with the Cingulate Island Sign being described. Alzheimer's disease causes low posterior temporoparietal cortical activity, which is similar to Parkinsonâs disease. Pick's disease affects the frontotemporal region. Hungtingtonâs causes low activity in the caudate nucleus head and putamen.
  Lewy body dementia
A core clinical feature to this dementia is the fluctuant nature of the symptoms. Parkinsonian features can also develop although these are usually subsequent to the memory decline. Visual hallucinations are also a feature. Radiologically there is a generalised decrease in cerebral volume (sparing the hippocampi). Temporo-parietal hypoperfusion on HMPAO Tc99m SPECT scanning is indicative of Lewy body dementia. Involvement of the occipital cortex, which is typically spared in Alzheimers disease, sets the two apart from one another on PET studies.",False,"Answer: 2. Alzheimer's disease. The decreased uptake in the lateral occipital cortex with preservation of the mid-posterior cingulate gyrus is a common imaging finding associated with Alzheimer's disease. This pattern of decreased uptake is thought to be due to the presence of amyloid plaques in the brain, which are a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease.",2,,B,True,"I chose option 1, Lewy Body Dementia, because the 18F-FDG PET study findings described in the question are consistent with this condition. The decreased uptake in the lateral occipital cortex with preservation of the mid-posterior cingulate gyrus is a characteristic pattern seen in Lewy Body Dementia. In contrast, the other conditions listed typically have different patterns of uptake on PET scans.

14224,201667,You are reviewing the chest radiograph of a 3-year-old girl. There is increased intrathoracic volume in the left chest with flattening of the hemidiaphragm. No foreign body is seen. What is the most likely diagnosis? Select ONE answer only.,SBA: Paediatrics,Inhaled foreign body,CPAM,Congenital lobar emphysema,Swyer-James syndrome,Extralobar sequestration,A,65%,3%,25%,6%,1%,"Explanation:
Inhaled foreign body
This is an important differential diagnosis to consider in paediatrics, particularly in younger mobile children in whom an accurate history may not be forthcoming. Not all foreign bodies are radio-opaque. Inhaled foreign bodies are slightly more likely to enter the right main bronchus than the left owing to its straighter course but left sided foreign bodies are by no means unheard of. Usually an inhaled foreign body will cause a ball-valve mechanism on the affected side leading to air-trapping and over-inflation. This gives rise to the CXR features described in the vignette. It is worth noting that the chest x-ray can also be normal in around a third of cases.
  Congenital Pulmonary Airway Malformation (CPAM) â also known as Congenital cystic adenomatoid malformation (CCAM)
Although often an antenatal diagnosis, CPAM should be considered in the investigation of a neonatal respiratory distress. Milder cases can present later when the child develops a LRTI and decompensates. On investigation a cystic mass is discovered. The malformation can exert a mass effect, causing both hypoplasia of the remainder of the ipsilateral lung as well as contralateral mediastinal shift.
  Congenital lobar over-inflation (previously congenital lobar emphysema)
It is usually the left upper lobe which is affected but approximately 40% of cases involve the left upper lobe; the right middle or the right upper lobes are affected in a further 55% of cases. There is a reasonable male preponderance of approximately 3:1.
On a CXR there is hyperlucency of the affected lobe and often mass effect on the mediastinum leading to contralateral mediastinal shift and thereby respiratory distress.
  Swyer-James syndrome
In this condition, normal development of the infant lung is impeded by bronchiolitis (viral or mycoplasma) at an early age, with superadded acute airspace destruction. Consequently, the affected lobe is small and lucent on the CXR due to air trapping. In an exam situation Swyer-James syndrome is usually given as a teenage or young adult patient with a history of recurrent LRTIs. Air trapping, and bronchiectasis can also be described.
  Pulmonary sequestration
Intralobar sequestrationâ This is more common (75%) but less severe. The affected segment does not have its own pleura and drains, like normal, via the pulmonary veins. Presents as recurrent pneumonias and is seen on a CXR as cysts with fluid levels. Some are associated with other congenital abnormalities but a larger proportion develop in isolation.
Extralobar sequestrationâ This is less common (25%) and more severe with around half of patients suffering from other additional congenital anomalies. Venous drainage is via the systemic circulation and patients present in childhood either with respiratory distress due to shunting of blood or with symptoms attributed to the associated congenital anomalies (e.g. diaphragmatic hernia). The segment has its own pleura and therefore collateral air drift via the pores of Kohn cannot occur. The lack of aeration helps differentiate it from intralobar sequestration. Seen on a CXR as an opacity adjacent to the heart, abutting the diaphragm.",False,"Congenital lobar emphysema is the most likely diagnosis because it is the most common cause of increased intrathoracic volume in the left chest with flattening of the hemidiaphragm in a 3-year-old girl. This condition is caused by a blockage of the bronchus that leads to the affected lobe, causing the air to become trapped and the lobe to become enlarged. Other causes, such as CPAM, inhaled foreign body, and extralobar sequestration, are less likely in this case. Swyer-James syndrome is caused by recurrent episodes of bronchiolitis and is more common in older children.",2,,C,False,"I chose option 2, congenital lobar emphysema, because the clinical presentation described in the question is consistent with this condition. Congenital lobar emphysema is a rare lung abnormality characterized by overinflation of one or more lobes of the lung. This overinflation can lead to increased intrathoracic volume and flattening of the hemidiaphragm, as mentioned in the question.

14570,201667,A 52-year-old man complains of a painful lump in his left foot. He undergoes an MRI scan which shows a 32mm lesion which you suspect to be a Morton neuroma. What are most likely signal characteristics of this lesion? Select ONE answer only.,SBA: Musculoskeletal and Trauma,"Low signal on T1, T2 and STIR","Low signal on T1 and T2, high signal on STIR","High signal on T1, low signal on T2 and STIR","Low signal on T1, high signal on T2 and STIR","High signal on T1, T2 and STIR",A,69%,11%,4%,14%,2%,"Explanation:
Morton neuroma
Fibrosis surrounding a plantar digital nerve leads to a hard lump developing in the sole of the foot. Patients complain of a painful lump which feels a bit like walking on a hot lump of gravel. On an MRI scan they are often slightly disguised by their low or isointensity to muscle on T1 weighted sequences and hypointensity on T2 weighted sequences. Curiously for a fibrotic process, they do usually enhance with gadolinium. On ultrasound the classic appearance of a hypoechoic mass situated between but slightly proximal to the metatarsal heads should be sufficient to make the diagnosis. Most are found in the third metatarsal space. The Mulder sign can be performed clinically or with ultrasound and involves eliciting pain and a clicking sound when the metatarsal heads are squeezed together while applying pressure on the dorsum of the foot over the neuroma, or scanning the sole of the foot.
It is said that Morton neuromas are larger and easier to visualise with MRI when the patient is prone, i.e. the foot is slightly plantar-flexed. On ultrasound this translates to a straightforward prone position or one where the patient is sitting on the side of the couch with their feet slightly plantar flexed. One theory is that any physical tension through the metatarsal joints (more likely on supine positioning) causes the neuroma to be pulled up in-between the metatarsal heads.",False,"I chose this answer because Morton neuromas are typically characterized by low signal on T1 and high signal on T2 and STIR. This is because they are typically composed of fibrous tissue and tend to have a higher water content, which results in a higher signal on T2 and STIR.",1,"3. A question about the application of knowledge, how to interpret the results?

3. A question about the application of knowledge, how to interpret the results?",D,False,"I chose option 2 (Low signal on T1 and T2, high signal on STIR) because Morton neuroma typically presents with these signal characteristics on MRI. 

Morton neuroma is a benign, fibrous tissue thickening around a nerve, usually between the third and fourth metatarsal heads in the foot. On MRI, it commonly exhibits the following signal characteristics:

- Low signal intensity on T1-weighted images: This is because the lesion primarily consists of fibrous tissue, which appears hypointense (dark) on T1-weighted images.
- Low signal intensity on T2-weighted images: Although fluid and edema typically show high signal intensity on T2-weighted images, the fibrous nature of Morton neuroma causes it to appear hypointense (dark) on T2-weighted images as well.
- High signal intensity on STIR (Short Tau Inversion Recovery) images: STIR is a fat-suppression sequence that highlights fluid and edema. Despite the fibrous nature of Morton neuroma, there may be some surrounding edema or inflammation, which would appear hyperintense (bright) on STIR images.

What is the most likely diagnosis?,"SBA: Genito urinary, Adrenal, Obstetrics & Gynaecology and Breast",Radial scar,Carcinoma,Phyllodes tumour,Fibroadenoma,Galactocoele,A,83%,8%,4%,2%,3%,"Explanation:
Radial scar
This used to be the classic description of a radial scar in a patient with prior breast surgery. Actually there is no association with prior surgery. Around half are associated with a carcinoma and hence management is usually surgical excision.
A carcinoma would typically be described as an area of architectural distortion, or a stellate mass.
  Fibroadenoma
Popcorn calcification is pathognomonic of a fibroadenoma. They tend to be nodular or lobulated in contour but with smooth margins. They often show a âhaloâ sign of low attenuation where tissue surrounding the lesion has been compressed.
  A phyllodes tumour
These would typically be described as having a similar appearance to a fibroadenoma. Occasionally they can demonstrate a âhaloâ sign.
  Galactocoele
A galactocoele appears during lactation as an enlarging painless mass. A fat-fluid level is a specific finding on a lateral view. These lesions would be far more likely to be ultrasound diagnoses than mammographic.

  IPF (Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis) can only be diagnosed in the absence of a precipitating condition such as asbestosis, rheumatoid arthritis, or drug toxicity. Where such exists, the condition is termed UIP (Usual interstitial pneumonia). CFA (Crytpogenic fibrosing alveolitis) is a historic term for the same thing.
There is much overlap in the features of the various different fibrotic lung diseases.
Therefore, look for specific features which are most strongly associated with the different conditions. The table below (despite appearances) simplifies the overall situation significantly and is inadequate for real life radiology but does provide a framework on which to build further understanding of these conditions.
The features in bold are the most prominent in each of the conditions.

9956,201667,A 29-year-old man performs a charity parachute jump but lands directly onto his feet despite instructions to fall to one side. He sustains a fracture and his images are being reviewed in a teaching session at your hospital. Which of the following is most susceptible to avascular necrosis?,SBA: Musculoskeletal and Trauma,Navicular,Calcaneum,Talus,Lumbar vertebra,Thoracic vertebra,A,62%,14%,22%,1%,1%,"Explanation:
Arguably the other bones listed may all be at greater risk of fracture during this kind of injury however it is the navicular which is most susceptible to avascular necrosis thereafter. Of note, the navicular is the last bone in the foot to ossify.
The navicular is particularly at risk of injury since it experiences stress at three different points, anteriorly by the first and second metatarsals (via the cuneiforms) and, at a point between them but posteriorly, from the talus. This fulcrum effect leaves it very susceptible to fracturing through its middle portion. In an unhappy coincidence the navicular receives its blood supply from two different sources and these anastomose in the same middle portion leaving it vulnerable to avascular necrosis in the case of a fracture.
Idiopathic avascular necrosis of the navicular in young children (4-6 years) is termed Kohler disease. The equivalent process in adults is called Mueller Weiss syndrome.",False,The calcaneum is the most susceptible to avascular necrosis because it is the most commonly affected bone in the foot due to its limited blood supply. This limited blood supply makes it more vulnerable to fracture and subsequent avascular necrosis.,1,"This question falls under category 2: A question about clinical judgement, what is the correct diagnosis?",B,False,"I chose option 3, the talus, because it is the most susceptible to avascular necrosis among the given options. Avascular necrosis, also known as osteonecrosis, is a condition where the bone tissue dies due to a lack of blood supply. The talus is particularly vulnerable to this condition because it has a limited blood supply compared to other bones, and any disruption to its blood supply can lead to avascular necrosis.

8881,201667,A 62-year-old lady complains to her GP of tenesmus. On examination there is a palpable mass but subsequent proctoscopy is normal. She undergoes an MRI which shows a 6cm mass posterior to the rectum which is of low signal on T1 and returns high signal on T2. On closer inspection it is contained within the mesorectum. Which of the following would best fit with these findings?,SBA: Gastrointestinal,Tailgut cyst,Rectal cancer,Tarlov cyst,Diverticular disease,Cystocoele,A,87%,3%,5%,1%,4%,"Explanation:
A tailgut duplication cyst (also known as retrorectal cystic hamartoma)
Curiously these occur almost exclusively in women. Anatomically they sit within the presacral or retrorectal fat. They tend to be an incidental diagnosis and can be associated with bony defects within the sacrum. An uncomplicated cyst will return low signal on T1 and high signal on T2 but often they contain mucein whereupon they appear characteristically high in signal on T1 weighted MRI sequences. They can be surprisingly large and are often multiloculated.
  A Tarlov cyst
A tarlov cyst is the name given to dilatation of the posterior nerve root sheath. They follow CSF on all sequences and can cause significant bony scalloping.
  Rectal cancer MRI
The muscularis propria is the outer wall of the rectum and shows up as low signal on T2 weighted sequences. 
Since the rectum (like the oesophagus) does not have a serosa, once spread beyond the muscularis propria into the mesorectal fat has occurred (ie a T3 tumour), nodal involvement is also feasible. The mesorectal fascia is a thin plane of connective tissue which contains fat, the rectum, local lymph nodes as a distinct anatomical entity and is of paramount importance in rectal cancer management. Spread beyond the mesorectal fascia denotes a T4 tumour. MRI is excellent for local staging of rectal cancer because the mesorectal fascia is seen clearly as a thin black line on T2 weighted sequences and its involvement or lack thereof can be readily discerned. In contrast, the tumour appears as intermediate signal on T2, distorting the normal anatomy. The fascia is also referred to as the âCRMâ which stands for circumferential resection margin and relates to the surgical operation performed for rectal tumours, namely a total mesorectal excision (TME). The proximity of the tumour extent to the CRM is prognostically important; tumours with a >1mm margin before they reach the CRM are far less likely to recur. A <1mm margin is taken as involvement of the CRM.
  Cystocoele
A cystocoele is bulging of the bladder into the vagina. Also termed an anterior prolapse, the condition is common in elderly women and those who have undergone traumatic deliveries.
On imaging the bulge will obviously match the bladder on all sequences.
  Diverticular disease
Diverticulosis is the presence of multiple tiny outpouchings, within the colon. Technically these are false diverticuli since they do not involve all of the layers of the colonic wall. Diverticulitis occurs when one or more of these diverticuli becomes acutely inflamed and/or infected. Diverticular disease is the term used to collect together the sequela of multiple episodes of diverticulitis which may have resulted in abscess formation, stricturing and fistula formation.",False,"I chose rectal cancer because it is the most likely diagnosis based on the described symptoms and findings. The presence of a palpable mass, a 6cm mass on MRI, and its location posterior to the rectum and within the mesorectum are all suggestive of rectal cancer.

10736,201667,A 40-year-old athlete complains of left sided calf claudication. On Doppler ultrasound there is popliteal stenosis. He undergoes an MRA which shows low T1 signal and high T2 signal in the wall of the popliteal artery. What is the most likely diagnosis?,SBA: Cardiothoracic and vascular,Cystic adventitial degeneration,Popliteal artery entrapment syndrome,Buerger disease,Spinal cord stenosis,Popliteal artery chronic thrombosis,A,75%,16%,5%,0%,4%,"Explanation:
Popliteal artery entrapment syndrome (PAES)
This arises due to an anomalous insertion of the medial head of gastrocnemius which compresses the popliteal artery leading to symptoms of claudication, particularly on exertion, in an otherwise fit individual. Of note, management is surgical; surgical release has far better outcomes than endovascular stenting.
  Cystic adventitial degeneration
On MRI scanning, mucous cysts can be seen in the wall of the popliteal artery. These, like most cysts, show high T2 signal and the T1 signal can be variable depending on the quantity of mucin present. This disease has a strong male preponderance and particularly affects the popliteal artery. On MRI the signal can be variable on T1 depending on the protein content of the cyst but returns a high signal on T2.
  Spinal cord stenosis
The inclusion of this answer pertains to symptoms of neurogenic claudication which can arise in the context of spinal cord stenosis or disc pathology, typically of the lumbar spine. Sensory and/or motor deficit at the appropriate level is found on neurological examination.
  Buerger disease
This disease is strongly linked to smoking and manifests as a vasculitis of the smaller arteries. Arterial occlusion with the formation of corkscrew-shaped collaterals occurs initially in the small arteries of the hands and feet but becoming more proximal as the disease progresses. Of note the larger proximal and central arteries lack the calcification which would otherwise be seen with disease of this extent when caused by atherosclerosis. 
 ",True,"Cystic Adventitial Degeneration is a condition characterized by cystic dilatation of the adventitia of the popliteal artery, which is often associated with claudication and other symptoms of vascular insufficiency. On MRA, this condition is typically seen as a low T1 signal and high T2 signal in the wall of the popliteal artery, which is what the athlete in the question is experiencing.",2,,E,True,"I chose option 1, Cystic adventitial degeneration, because the given information in the question supports this diagnosis. The patient is a 40-year-old athlete with left-sided calf claudication and popliteal stenosis found on Doppler ultrasound. The MRA findings of low T1 signal and high T2 signal in the wall of the popliteal artery are consistent with cystic adventitial degeneration.

Cystic adventitial degeneration is a rare vascular disorder that can cause intermittent claudication, particularly in young to middle-aged male patients who are physically active. It is characterized by the development of mucinous cysts within the adventitial layer of the arterial wall, leading to compression and stenosis of the affected artery. In this case, the popliteal artery is affected, which is the most common site for this condition.

The other options are less likely given the patient's presentation and imaging findings:

2. Popliteal artery entrapment syndrome typically presents with similar symptoms, but the MRA findings would likely show compression or displacement of the popliteal artery by surrounding muscles or tendons rather than changes within the arterial wall itself.

3. Buerger disease (Thromboangiitis obliterans) is a rare inflammatory condition affecting small and medium-sized arteries and veins, typically in young male smokers. The MRA findings would likely show segmental occlusions and ""corkscrew"" collateral vessels, which are not mentioned in the question.

4. Spinal cord stenosis is not related to the popliteal artery or calf claudication and would not explain the MRA findings in this case.

Select ONE answer only.,SBA: Musculoskeletal and Trauma,Sprengel shoulder,Klippel-Feil syndrome,Ankylosing spondylitis,Rheumatoid arthritis,Post-operative,A,53%,5%,8%,27%,7%,"Explanation:
There is a differential diagnosis for block vertebra and although Sprengel shoulder features as a predominant part of Klippel-Feil syndrome, an isolated sprengel shoulder is not a cause of block vertebra.
Differential diagnosis for block vertebra:
Congenital
Klippel-Feil syndrome
Isolated
Arthritides
Rheumatoid arthritis
Ankylosing spondylitis
Miscellaneous
Post-operative
Post-traumatic fusion
Post-Tuberculosis infection
  Sprengel shoulder
This condition can occur in isolation as well as part of Klippel-Feil syndrome. It is (like Klippel-Feil syndrome) also often associated with renal anomalies. Sprengel shoulder is a congenital abnormality where the scapula (usually, but not exclusively, unilateral) is attached to the cervical vertebra either by a fibrous or osseous connection, and therefore fails to descend into the normal position. The result is elevation and medial rotation of the scapula, which is usually hypoplastic. The condition can be readily appreciated on a plain film although cross-sectional imaging is useful to plan surgical correction if required. If present, the osseous connection between the scapula and the spine is termed an omovertebral bar.
  Klippel-Feil syndrome (different from Klippel-Trenaunay-Weber syndrome: port-wine stains, localised hypertrophy and venous malformations)
Klippel-Feil syndrome is predominantly a segmentation anomaly which arises during foetal development and leads to cervical fusion of two or more vertebral bodies. C2-3 are most commonly involved, accounting for around half of cases. Thereafter C5-6 accounts for a further third and the remainder are made up from fusions at other levels. There are a multitude of associated features, the predominant ones of which include:
Renal abnormalities (of which a third have unilateral renal agenesis) - â
Scoliosis >20o - Â½
Sprengel shoulder - â
Deafness (sensorineural) - â
Cervical ribs - â
  The renal anomalies seen include agenesis or dysgenesis, ectopic location, and duplication.
Yet further features of this condition, all present in under 20% of cases include:
Odontoid dysplasia
Hemivertebrae / butterfly vertebrae
Syringomyelia / diastomatomyelia
Ear anomalies (microtia, deformed ossicles etc)
Congenital heart disease (ASD or coarctation)",False,"I chose 3. Ankylosing spondylitis because block vertebra is not a symptom of ankylosing spondylitis.

This question falls under category 1: Basic factual recall, either of basic science, physics, anatomy or regarding a procedure.",A,False,"I chose Rheumatoid Arthritis as the answer because it is not a typical cause of block vertebrae. 

A block vertebra is a congenital condition where two or more adjacent vertebrae are fused together, resulting in reduced mobility and potential neurological symptoms. Here's a brief explanation of the other options:

1. Klippel-Feil Syndrome: This is a congenital disorder characterized by the fusion of two or more cervical vertebrae, making it a direct cause of block vertebrae.
2. Ankylosing Spondylitis: This is a chronic inflammatory disease that primarily affects the spine and sacroiliac joints, leading to progressive fusion of the vertebrae (ankylosis) and potentially causing block vertebrae.
4. Post-operative: Block vertebrae can be a result of surgical fusion of the spine, either intentionally (e.g., to treat instability) or as a complication.
5. Sprengel Shoulder: This is a congenital disorder where the scapula (shoulder blade) is abnormally high, often associated with Klippel-Feil Syndrome and block vertebrae.

Rheumatoid arthritis, on the other hand, is an autoimmune inflammatory disease that primarily affects the synovial joints.

What is the diagnosis?",SBA: Gastrointestinal,Hepatic veno-occlusive disease,Acute Budd-Chiari syndrome,Primary biliary cirrhosis,Passive hepatic congestion,Viral hepatitis,A,47%,20%,1%,23%,10%,"Explanation:
Terminology
Budd-Chiari syndrome is hepatic venous occlusion by any cause. It can be subdivided into primary and secondary causes as follows:
Primary - endoluminal cause such as thrombosis, web or endophlebitis
Secondary - the obstructon is caused by something unrelated to the venous system such as tumour cells, abscess formation, cysts. Obstruction can be caused either by invasion or extrinsic compression.
  Hepatic venous outflow obstruction
There are three separate aetiologies which all overlap both in terms of their clinical and radiological features. They are, however, separate entities, caused by subtly different processes.
Passive hepatic congestion â this arises due to a cardiac problem such as right sided heart failure of any cause or constrictive pericarditis. Tender hepatomegaly is common and on imaging the hepatic veins and IVC are notably enlarged.
Hepatic vein obstruction â the pathology here is within the hepatic veins with thrombosis or other non-thrombotic obstruction (e.g. extrinsic compression). Acutely there is abdominal pain, ascites and hepatomegaly. The presence or absence of caudate lobe hypertrophy can help distinguish between a chronic process or an acute one where this has not had sufficient time to develop.
Hepatic veno-occlusive disease â fibrosis of the tiny venules can develop following a stem-cell transplant, and by pyrrolizidine alkaloids found in Jamaican bush teas. Clinically patients present with weight gain due to fluid retention, hepatomegaly and jaundice.

  All three cause hepatomegaly and ascites, although fluid overload in general is a particular feature of hepatic veno-occlusive disease. On CT all three can give a ânutmegâ appearance to the liver when, on early phase imaging, contrast has yet to homogenise throughout the liver and consequently there is a mottled appearance which rather resembles the cut surface of a nutmeg. On delayed phase imaging the liver becomes more homogeneous. The flip-flop sign is particularly associated with Budd-Chiari syndrome with strong central and limited peripheral enhancement on early phases followed by early central washout with retained peripheral enhancement on delayed images.
  Hepatic vein obstruction
The haemodynamics of the liver, as being different from any other organ, can give rise to some interesting pathology. Hepatic venous obstruction causes flow reversal in the portal venous system to drain the liver. Acutely this presents as a triad of abdominal pain, ascites and hepatomegaly. In many acute cases the liver function tests have not had sufficient time to become deranged. The caudate lobe usually drains directly into the IVC so may not be affected by the underlying cause of obstruction to the other hepatic veins. Consequently it is able to shoulder more of the usual burden of the liver and becomes hypertrophied. In the acute setting this has not had time to manifest and the caudate lobe will be of a normal size.
Some of the many causes of hepatic vein obstruction 
Thrombosis of the hepatic veins
Platelets (thrombocytosis)
Pill (OCP)
Pregnancy (hypercoagulable state)
Polycythaemia rubra vera
Non-thrombotic causes
Mechanical compression by a tumour
Right atrial myxoma
Constrictive pericarditis
  On CT the enhancement pattern is described as being âflip-flopâ, with strong central and limited peripheral enhancement on early phases followed by early central washout with retained peripheral enhancement on delayed images. Alternatively the whole liver may appear mottled with a ânutmegâ type pattern due to the venous congestion. On Doppler ultrasound or MRI the hepatic veins will show a reduction in calibre or not be seen at all and on Doppler insonation the hepatic veins may show little or no flow. Flow in the portal venous system, on the other hand, may be reversed. In chronic cases a veritable spiders-web of small collateral vessels can be seen on angiography; they can also be seen on MRI and are described as having a comma-shape.
  Passive hepatic congestion
This is similar to chronic hepatic vein obstruction, but whereas that arises due to hepatic outflow obstruction, in heart failure leading to hepatic congestion there is no mechanical obstruction. In contrast to acute thrombotic Budd-Chiari syndrome there is distension of the hepatic veins and IVC, a feature which distinguishes it from hepatic veno-occlusive disease as well. Other signs of heart failure, such as pleural effusions and ascites may be present concurrently.
  Hepatic veno-occlusive disease
The outcome of hepatic veno-occlusive disease is similar to that of hepatic venous obstruction but the mechanism is different. Hepatic congestion develops as a consequence of fibrosis to the venules within the liver. This can occur secondary to chemotherapy or bone marrow transplantation and also bizarrely due to pyrrolizidine alkaloids which are found in Jamaican bush teas. On imaging there is overlap with the features of hepatic venous obstruction but crucially the hepatic veins should appear normal; it is the smaller venules which cause the problem and these are not seen on ultrasound or CT.
  Primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC)
This can be difficult to distinguish from PSC however whereas PSC can involve both intra and extrahepatic ducts, PBC only involves the intrahepatic ducts. It is an autoimmune condition and, like many other autoimmune conditions, patients are typically women in their middle ages. Antimitochondrial antibodies (AMA) are present in the vast majority of patients. On imaging, the secondary cirrhotic effects are most pertinent with caudate lobe hypertrophy and left lobar atrophy. The periportal halo sign as seen on MRI is reasonably specific and relates to fluid accumulation around the portal triad.
  Viral hepatitis
The imaging findings of hepatitis are non-specific and include hepatomegaly, decreased echogenicity, periportal oedema, and gallbladder wall thickening. The âstarry skyâ appearance is used to describe a liver which has a number of bright echogenic dots on a background of diffuse low reflectivity and this has traditionally been associated with hepatitis however both the sensitivity and specificity of this sign are low.",False,"I chose number 2 because Acute Budd-Chiari Syndrome is a condition that is caused by an obstruction of the hepatic veins, which is what the Doppler study showed. This obstruction can cause ascites, hepatomegaly, and liver function tests to be deranged. It is also seen more commonly in individuals who have recently returned from a tropical holiday, such as Jamaica, which is what the patient in this case has done.",2,,B,True,"I chose option 1, Hepatic veno-occlusive disease, because the patient's symptoms and ultrasound findings align with this diagnosis. Hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD) is a condition in which the small veins within the liver become blocked, leading to congestion and liver dysfunction. This can result in symptoms such as abdominal pain, ascites (fluid accumulation in the abdomen), and hepatomegaly (enlarged liver), as well as deranged liver function tests, as seen in this patient.

The increased pulsatility observed in the Doppler study also supports this diagnosis, as it indicates altered blood flow within the liver due to the obstruction of the small veins. The other options do not fit the clinical presentation and ultrasound findings as well as hepatic veno-occlusive disease does:

2. Acute Budd-Chiari syndrome typically presents with hepatomegaly, ascites, and abdominal pain, but the Doppler ultrasound would likely show abnormalities in the hepatic veins, not just increased pulsatility in the portal veins.
 
3. Primary biliary cirrhosis is a chronic liver disease that leads to progressive destruction of the bile ducts within the liver. It typically presents with fatigue, pruritus (itching), and jaundice, rather than the symptoms described in this case.

4. Passive hepatic congestion is a result of right-sided heart failure, which would likely present with additional signs of heart failure, such as jugular venous distention and peripheral edema.

Image Â© Medical Exam Prep
    Pelvic lipomatosis
This is a curious condition which arises in young-middle aged adults. There is significant overgrowth of fat cells within the pelvis which can lead to compression of all or any of the pelvic structures. The bladder becomes pear shaped as the main volume is pulled superiorly. Similarly, the sigmoid is elevated out of the pelvis and the rectum straightened to its shortest path. On CT there is a striking amount of low attenuation fat within the pelvis and similarly this will be seen as high T1 signal on MRI.
  A tailgut duplication cyst (retrorectal cystic hamartoma)
Curiously these occur almost exclusively in women. Anatomically they sit within the presacral or retrorectal fat. They tend to be an incidental diagnosis and can be associated with bony defects within the sacrum. Since they usually contain mucein they appear characteristically high in signal on T1 weighted MRI sequences. They can be surprisingly large and are often multiloculated.
  A Tarlov cyst
A Tarlov cyst is the name given to dilatation of the posterior nerve root sheath. They follow CSF on all sequences and can cause significant bony scalloping.
  Liposarcoma
It would not be possible to diagnose this on the basis of a barium enema. It would be a differential diagnosis for pelvic lipomatosis as seen on CT but usually contain a variable degree of soft tissue attenuation whereas the only soft tissue attenuation seen with pelvic lipomatosis results from anatomical distortion of normal structures.
  Ulcerative colitis
On a barium enema the colon and rectum can appear featureless â the so-called lead pipe appearance. Otherwise the mucosal surface is said to have a granular appearance.",False,"Tarlov cysts are sacs of cerebrospinal fluid that form near the nerve roots of the sacrum.

The other options are less likely to be the cause of widening of the presacral space:

2. Chemotherapy: This is a treatment for cancer and does not directly cause widening of the presacral space.
3. Vertebral haemangioma: This is a benign vascular tumor that occurs within the vertebral body, not in the presacral space.

Please note that the question asks which answer is NOT an indication for CEUS.
A lesion high up in segment VII is unlikely to be well visualised with ultrasound.
  Contrast enhanced ultrasound (CEUS)
CEUS is cheaper than MRI and confers less risk to the patient. The patient is injected with a contrast agent consisting of tiny microbubbles measuring micrometers in diameter. These circulate within the patient and when insonated cause strong reflections which show up as hyperechogenicity in real time as the bubbles wash in and out of the field of view. The microbubbles burst in time and the process can be repeated within a few minutes if required. There is no renal toxicity and adverse reactions are very rare meaning this is a safe procedure for almost all patients. The most significant limitation is the location of the lesion; if the lesion cannot be seen with B-mode ultrasound then it cannot be interrogated with CEUS.
It is a useful technique particularly for differentiating between malignant lesions (which tend to washout rapidly owing to their high vascularity), and benign lesions but is also useful for characterising benign lesions such as haemangiomata or focal nodular hyperplasia by demonstrating the same enhancement patterns which would otherwise be expected on an MRI.
The technique, having been developed with liver lesions in mind, is now being expanded to renal lesions, testicular masses and vascular work too, among others.",False,"I chose number 3 because contrast enhanced ultrasound is used to evaluate lesions that cannot be clearly seen on ultrasound alone, such as lesions that are hypoechoic or hyperenhancing.

14474,201667,"A 40-year-old lady is brought into the Emergency Department following a fall caused by her first ever seizure. She has otherwise been fit and well. She undergoes a CT scan of her head which shows calcified lesions, each having a thin rim of low attenuation around them. A pelvis x-ray shows soft tissue calcification around the hip. What is the most likely diagnosis?",SBA: Central Nervous and Head & Neck,Neurocysticercosis,Neurofibromatosis,Cavernoma,Osteosarcoma metastases,Dermatomyositis,A,79%,3%,3%,11%,4%,"Explanation:
The information provided in this vignette is confusing since once calcified, the lesions usually do not demonstrate perilesional oedema (low attenuation). However, the presence of soft tissue calcification around the pelvis region suggests that this is the diagnosis being alluded to.
  Neurocysticercosis
Cysticercosis is caused by a tapeworm native to low income countries and carried by pigs. It is the most common parasitic infection involving the central nervous system and the central nervous system is itself commonly affected during the disease process; around 90% of cases show CNS involvement. The larva disseminate via the suparachnoid and intraventricular system and consequentially the meninges are most frequently affected, being involved in around 40% of cases, with particular involvement of the basal cisterns. Parenchymal involvement occurs in around a fifth of cases. The larval cells (termed cysticerci) also migrate to large skeletal muscle and, following destruction, become calcified and visible on plain radiographs as 'rice-grain' calcification. The long axis of the foci of calcification is usually orientated along the muscle fibres in which they are situated.
    Parasitic stage Features
Larval Small foci of oedema
Vesicular Small CSF cysts without surrounding oedema but containing a 2-3mm mural nodule (cyst with a dot)
Colloidal vesicular
Ring enhancing cyst with proteinaceous content
Focal seizures
Nodular granular stage Cyst shrinks and becomes isointense to brain on T1, hypointense on T2
Calcified stage
Small focal calcifications appearing 1-10 years following acute infection
Rice-like muscle calcification
Seizures or asymptomatic
  Cavernoma
The classical feature of a cavernoma (aka cavernous haemangioma) on MRI is the âpopcornâ appearance caused by a bright lobulated centre surrounded by a rim of hypointensity. Haemosiderin deposition causes the blooming artefact on susceptibility weighted sequences. It is perhaps slightly counterintuitive that there can be no enhancement on post-contrast CT scans, given the vascular nature of these lesions, however when we consider that flow within the lesion may be very slow then this makes a little more sense. Another important distinguishing feature from other lesions is the fact that, unlike metastases, there is no mass effect or oedema from these lesions, despite the fact that they can often present with seizures. Associated cutaneous manifestations of multiple cavernomas include cafe au lait spots and cherry angiomas, neither of which calcify.
  Neurofibromatosis
Type 2 neurofibromatosis (MISME) is characterised by multiple meningiomas, schwannomas and ependymomas. In theory multiple calcified meningiomas each with a rim of surrounding oedema could be present. Neurofibromatosis is also in the differential diagnosis for soft tissue calcification though this relates to curvilinear calcifications related to plexiform neurofibromas (ie type 1 neurofibromatosis).
  Osteosarcoma metastases
Osteosarcoma can cause soft tissue calcification, and within the lungs is a classic cause for calcified lung metastases however brain metastases (from all causes) rarely calcify. In the few cases reported in the literature the calcification is more globular than peripheral/rim calcification.
  Dermatomyositis
This is a classic cause of soft tissue calcification with striking 'sheets' of calcification occurring in severe cases. Intracranial calcification is not a feature however.",False,Neurofibromatosis is a genetic disorder that causes tumors to grow along the nerves in the body. The calcified lesions on the CT scan and the soft tissue calcification around the hip are both symptoms of this disorder.,2,,A,True,"I chose option 1, Neurocysticercosis, because the clinical scenario and imaging findings are consistent with this diagnosis. Neurocysticercosis is a parasitic infection caused by the larval stage of the tapeworm Taenia solium. It is the most common parasitic infection of the central nervous system, and can present with seizures, which is the case in this patient.

The CT scan findings of calcified lesions with a thin rim of low attenuation around them are characteristic of neurocysticercosis. These calcified lesions represent dead cysticerci, while the low attenuation rim suggests inflammation or edema around the lesions.

The soft tissue calcification around the hip seen on the pelvis x-ray can also be seen in systemic cysticercosis, as the larvae can migrate to various tissues in the body, including muscles.

The other options are less likely given the clinical and imaging findings:
2. Neurofibromatosis typically presents with multiple neurofibromas and cafÃ©-au-lait spots, not calcified lesions in the brain.
3. Cavernomas are vascular malformations in the brain, which would not explain the soft tissue calcification in the pelvis.
4. Osteosarcoma metastases would be expected to involve the bones, not present as calcified lesions in the brain and soft tissue calcification in the pelvis.

Please note that the question asks which of the answers is NOT correct.
MLO and CC are the standard views performed at screening.
If further view are required these are usually decided on a case-by-case basis.
  A true lateral view can help demonstrate suspected teacup calcifications are teacup calcifications. Compression views are used to interrogate suspicious calcifications seen on mammograms further.
A rolled CC view can help separate out structures to prove that the 'mass' seen on the original mammogram was a summation shadow, or to confirm the presence of a mass.
  Teacup calcifications
Teacup calcifications are caused by liquid milk of calcium within fibrocystic change. On mammography they appear as small curvilinear thin calcifications resembling the fluid level in a teacup on lateral views and rounded on a craniocaudal view, like a teacup viewed from above. Although teacup calcifications are typically benign in nature and suggestive of only fibrocystic changes they must be distinguished from suspicious calcifications. Thus, the best views for confirming the presence of teacup calcifications would be a true lateral, as opposed to an oblique lateral, and a CC view.",False,"A true lateral view is not used in mammography. This view is not useful for investigating teacup calcifications because it does not provide enough magnification. Instead, a magnified CC view is used to investigate teacup calcifications.

An oblique lateral view, also known as a mediolateral oblique (MLO) view, is one of the basic screening views in mammography. It is taken at an angle and provides a comprehensive view of the breast tissue, including the pectoral muscle and axillary tail.

A rolled craniocaudal (CC) view is a specialized view used to separate summation shadows or better visualize a specific area of the breast. In this view, the breast is slightly rolled to one side, allowing better visualization of the medial or lateral aspects of the breast.

Please note that the question asks which answer is INCORRECT.
  Benign intracranial hypertension - (idiopathic intracranial hypertension)
This condition can easily be overlooked but causes significant morbidity for patients if undiagnosed. Increased intracranial pressure of the CSF on the surrounding brain causes:
Flattening of the posterior aspect of the globe
Tortuosity of the optic nerves
Empty sella syndrome (or partially so)
Small, 'pinched' lateral ventricles (slit-like appearance is a relatively rare, poor sign to rely on).
  Sagittal sinus thrombosis
In sagittal sinus thrombosis the development of cerebral oedema secondary to infarction can compress the lateral ventricles, a finding in approximately a third of cases.
In contrast to this, prominent temporal horns, suggestive of developing hydrocephalus can be seen in sagittal sinus thrombosis due to decreased CSF absorption.
Ventricular bleeds might be seen in sagittal sinus thrombosis in the neonatal age group.
Bilateral haemorrhages in the context of sagittal sinus thrombosis are caused by venous infarction.
Papilloedema can be seen with both sagittal sinus thrombosis and idiopathic intracranial hypertension but is not an imaging feature.",False,"Ventricular bleeds are not commonly seen in benign intracranial hypertension.

In patients with heart rates below around 70 beats per minute, end-diastole is the optimal time for imaging. In these patients, diastole is the longest period the heart is still for, and therefore ideal for imaging.
Diastole is also the part of the cardiac cycle which decreases in duration when the heart rate increases. This reduces the duration of the imaging window during cardiac CT. The period of time the heart remains still for in systole stays constant when the heart rate increases. Therefore in patients with increased heart rates, imaging at end-systole is the optimal target.",False,"End-diastole is the optimal phase of the cardiac cycle for image acquisition in this patient because it is the period of the cardiac cycle when the heart is most relaxed and the ventricles are filled with the most blood. This allows for the best visualization of the heart's chambers and vessels. Additionally, the patient's resting heart rate decreases to 85 beats per minute with a breath hold, which is indicative of a lower heart rate and thus a longer diastolic phase.

In a cardiac CT, it is crucial to minimize motion artifacts to obtain high-quality images for accurate diagnosis.

She is worried as she has a strong family history of heart problems. She undergoes a 24-hour ECG which is normal, but an exercise ECG shows some lateral T-wave inversion. An Adenosine stress MRI is planned for further evaluation. Which of the following is NOT a contra-indication to Adenosine stress MRI? Select ONE answer only.",SBA: Cardiothoracic and vascular,Hypotension 100/60mmHg,Severe aortic stenosis,Gastric pacemaker,Uncontrolled atrial fibrillation,Bronchospasm,A,47%,3%,36%,5%,8%,"Explanation:
Please note that the question asks which is NOT a contraindication.
  Adenosine stress MRI has overtaken dobutamine stress MRI in terms of sensitivity and specificity for investigating the presence of ischaemia or infarction. Adenosine causes coronary vasodilation. If there is a haemodynamically significant stenosis to a coronary vessel, the vessels distal to the stenosis are already maximally dilated to maximise flow and thus the application of adenosine makes no difference to the vessel calibre or the resultant perfusion. Furthermore, the vasodilatation to the remaining unoccluded vessels can 'steal' blood from the stenosed territory and this is seen as hypoperfusion to the affected territory. Dipyridamole (antiplatelet), blocks uptake of adenosine and so patients taking this are also poor candidates for this test, however dipyridimole itself can also induce vasodilatation so may be used as an agent in its own right instead of adenosine.
Contraindications to adenosine include:
Second or third degree heart block
Bronchospasm
Hypotension <90mmHg systolic
Myocardial infarction within 48hrs
Uncontrolled arrhythmia
Severe/critical aortic stenosis
  The half-life of adenosine is exceptionally short, around 10 seconds, thus any side effects experienced during the scan resolve very quickly. It also means that during the scan, in order to maintain the effect, the adenosine must be given as an infusion.
Dobutamine stress MRI has been shown to be more sensitive and specific for cardiac disease than a dobutamine stress echocardiogram. It is a sympathomimetic so works by inducing the heart to beat both faster and stronger. By increasing the stress on the whole heart, hitherto compensated areas are unmasked. The drug is given at increasing doses ever 3 minutes until any of:
  The heart rate has increased to around 85% of its resting maximum
New wall motion abnormality is seen
Blood pressure rises above 240/220mmHg
Systolic blood pressure falls by 40mmHg
The patient develops persistent arrhythmias
The patient becomes too symptomatic to continue the scan
  Aside from the usual contra-indications to performing the MRI in the first place, specific contra-indications to performing a dobutamine stress MRI include:
Hypertension >220/120mmHg
Unstable angina
Aortic stenosis (severe)
Uncontrolled atrial fibrillation
Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy
Congestive heart failure",False,"I chose 3. Gastric pacemaker as the correct answer because Adenosine stress MRI is contraindicated in patients with pacemakers and implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs). Adenosine stress MRI can cause interference with the pacemaker or ICD, leading to potentially dangerous results.",1,"3. A question about clinical judgement, what is the correct management?",D,True,"I chose option 5 (Hypotension 100/60mmHg) as it is NOT a contra-indication to Adenosine stress MRI. Adenosine stress MRI is a diagnostic test used to evaluate the blood flow to the heart muscle during stress and rest conditions. Contra-indications are factors that make this test potentially unsafe or less accurate for a patient.

In this case, the other options are contra-indications for the following reasons:
1. Severe aortic stenosis: Adenosine stress MRI can cause increased stress on the heart, which may be dangerous for patients with severe aortic stenosis.
2. Gastric pacemaker: The magnetic field of the MRI can interfere with the functioning of the pacemaker, causing it to malfunction.
3. Uncontrolled atrial fibrillation: Adenosine stress MRI can exacerbate the atrial fibrillation, leading to more severe symptoms and potential complications.
4. Bronchospasm: Adenosine stress MRI can cause bronchospasm, which may worsen respiratory symptoms in patients with asthma or other respiratory conditions.

Option 5 (Hypotension 100/60mmHg) is not a contra-indication because a blood pressure of 100/60mmHg is still within the normal range for many individuals. While adenosine can cause some vasodilation and a temporary drop in blood pressure, this value is not low enough to pose a significant risk during the test.",A,True,A,True,"[{""page_content"": ""D.

Wernickeâs does give similar imaging appearances, but would not be a likely diagnosis in this age group and would not have a serum lactic acidosis.
Kearns-Sayre syndrome is another mitochondrial disorder which is associated with subcortical calcifications and basal ganglia siderotic deposits.

Leigh disease is a rare, inherited neurometabolic disorder characterized by rapidly progressive ataxia, ophthalmoplegia, dystonia, and respiratory rhythm disturbance.

The MRI findings mentioned, such as high T2 signal in the putamen and periaqueductal grey matter, are characteristic of Leigh disease. These areas are often affected due to their high energy demands and vulnerability to mitochondrial dysfunction.

The other options are less likely because:

1. Adrenoleukodystrophy typically presents with progressive neurological decline and adrenal insufficiency. It mainly affects white matter and does not usually cause the specific MRI findings mentioned.
2. Wernicke's encephalopathy is usually associated with thiamine deficiency and commonly affects alcoholics. It typically presents with confusion, ataxia, and ophthalmoplegia but does not usually cause the specific MRI findings or elevated lactate to pyruvate ratio.

 ",False,"I chose Panner Disease because it is a condition that is most commonly seen in children and adolescents, and this patient is 23 years old, which is outside of the typical age range for this condition. Additionally, Panner Disease is characterized by fragmentation and sclerosis of the head of the metatarsal, which is consistent with the findings on the x-ray.",2,,B,True,"I chose Freiberg disease because the description provided in the question matches the typical findings seen in this condition. Freiberg disease, also known as Freiberg infraction, is an osteochondrosis that specifically affects the metatarsal heads, most commonly the second metatarsal. It is more frequently seen in young females, which matches the age and gender of the patient in the question.

The fragmentation and sclerosis of the head of the second metatarsal, as mentioned in the question, are characteristic radiographic findings in Freiberg disease. The other options listed do not match the description provided:

1. Panner disease affects the capitellum of the elbow, not the metatarsals.
2. Kienbock disease involves the lunate bone in the wrist, not the metatarsals.

11226,201667,A 33-year-old lady being investigated for primary infertility is found to have a solitary ovarian lesion on transvaginal ultrasound scanning. It has an anechoic centre and demonstrates peripheral vascularity on colour Doppler flow. A Î²HCG urine test performed the same day was negative. What is the most likely diagnosis?,"SBA: Genito urinary, Adrenal, Obstetrics & Gynaecology and Breast",Corpus luteum cyst,Mature teratoma,Yolk sac tumour,Endometrioma,Leydig-Sertoli tumour,A,83%,2%,2%,8%,4%,"Explanation:
Corpus luteal cyst
The corpus luteum comprises the remnant of an ovarian follicle post ovulation. Without fertilisation the normal corpus luteum will involute spontaneously within 2 weeks but occasionally they can persist even in the absence of fertilisation and be seen as a corpus luteum cyst. Ultrasound characteristics depend slightly on the age of the cyst and the presence or absence of haemorrhage within it but a small (<3 cm) thick walled, rounded, cystic structure with peripheral vascularity (the so-called âring of fireâ) would be classical. A repeat ultrasound scan after 6 weeks (to ensure a different part of the menstrual cycle) is usually recommended.
  Mature teratoma
Teratomas and dermoid cysts have very similar imaging characteristics despite their histological differences. Teratomas are the most common ovarian neoplasm but are slow growing and usually benign. By contrast immature teratomas are malignant. The presence of fat is a strong indicator for a mature teratoma with the combination of fat, fluid and calcification being highly specific. On MRI the fat will show the usual signal drop-out on gradient echo sequences. Calcification will show as low signal on T2. Although benign, mature teratomas can be complicated by torsion or rupture. Malignant degeneration if it does occur, is to squamous cell carcinoma most commonly.
  Endometrioma 
These occur as part of the spectrum of endometriosis. Although often ovarian in location they can be found in the peritoneal cavity as well as elsewhere. The ectopic endometrial tissue undergoes cyclical haemorrhage leading to a build-up of blood products and debris which gives rise to a variety of imaging characteristics. Most commonly they appear as a single cyst with posterior acoustic enhancement and homogeneous internal low-level echoes on ultrasound. On MRI the signal characteristics will vary depending on the blood content. High T1 signal suggests old blood products but must be differentiated from the fat of a potential teratoma by checking to see that the signal persists (or is not suppressed) on the fat saturated sequences. The presence of the Shading sign is very suggestive of an endometrioma and occurs when there is low signal on T2 as blood products are usually low on T2. The shading sign is useful to make the distinction from haemorrhagic corpus luteal cysts since the fresh blood in those will not have degraded sufficient to cause the T2 darkening of endometriomas.
  Yolk sac tumour
These unpleasant germ cell tumours affect adolescents and can be quite large at presentation. A raised serum AFP is common. They are usually solid with or without cystic areas. Since they can arise from an ovarian dermoid, sometimes fat signal can also be seen in association with these tumours.
  Leydig-Sertoli tumour
It would be unusual to find a Leydig-Sertoli tumour in a patient older than 30 and most patients are in their early teens. Normal Leydig and Sertoli cells are found in the testes and produce testosterone and oestrogen respectively, among other hormones. Leydig-Sertoli tumours often produce one or both hormones in excess leading to virilisation and amenorrhoea, although some patients may experience no hormonal manifestations. AFP is often elevated. They are solid, fibrous tumours which can show cystic elements where haemorrhage or necrosis has taken place. Owing to their fibrous nature they usually return low signal on MRI, with/without high signal foci related to the cystic areas.",False,"Mature teratomas are the most common type of ovarian cyst seen in women of reproductive age. They are typically characterized by an anechoic centre and peripheral vascularity on color Doppler flow. The presence of a negative Î²HCG urine test also supports the diagnosis of a mature teratoma, as these cysts are not associated with hormonal production.",2,,B,True,"I chose option 1, corpus luteum cyst, as the most likely diagnosis based on the information provided. The patient is a 33-year-old lady being investigated for primary infertility, which means she is likely to be ovulating. A corpus luteum cyst is a common, benign ovarian lesion that forms after ovulation.

The ultrasound findings also support this diagnosis. The lesion has an anechoic (fluid-filled) center and peripheral vascularity on color Doppler flow, which are characteristic features of a corpus luteum cyst. 

Additionally, the negative Î²HCG urine test rules out a pregnancy-related condition, such as an ectopic pregnancy, which could also present with a similar ultrasound appearance.

The other options are less likely based on the given information:
- Mature teratoma (option 2) typically presents as a solid mass with cystic components and calcifications on ultrasound.
- Yolk sac tumor (option 3) is a rare malignant ovarian tumor, usually associated with elevated serum markers such as AFP, which is not mentioned in this case.
- Endometrioma (option 4) typically presents as a ""chocolate cyst"" with homogenous low-level internal echoes on ultrasound, not an anechoic center.

Bilateral x-rays of the wrist are requested which show soft tissue swelling to the second and third digits with marginal erosions and periosteal new bone formation.  Which additional feature would be most likely in this case? Select ONE answer only.,SBA: Musculoskeletal and Trauma,Salmon pink rash,Petechiae,Conjunctivitis,Port-wine stain,Erythema multiforme,A,79%,2%,8%,1%,9%,"Explanation:
Psoriatic arthropathy
Around a fifth of patients with psoriasis develop arthropathy and it is also possible to suffer from psoriatic arthropathy in the absence of the typical psoriatic cutaneous plaques.
Importantly, on x-ray there are findings of both erosive changes in addition to productive changes with periosteal new bone formation. The combination of the two contrives to leave a âpencil-in-cupâ appearance. The joints can appear fluffy due to the exuberance of new bone formation.
The differential diagnosis for periosteal reactions in the presence of an arthropathy is relatively narrow and very specific:
Psoriatic arthropathy
Juvenile rheumatoid arthritis
Reiter syndrome
Infective arthritis
  Although often classified as a distal arthropathy, preferring the DIPs to the MCPs, psoriatic arthropathy does also affect the spine and SI joints frequently. âSausage digitsâ is a term used to describe the diffuse soft tissue swelling which can affect the fingers and toes. Osteoporosis does occur but is a feature of later disease.",True,"I chose this answer because salmon pink rashes are often associated with inflammatory conditions like rheumatoid arthritis, which can cause pain in the wrists and other joints.

The carpal tunnel is a passageway on the palmar side of the wrist that connects the forearm to the middle compartment of the deep plane of the hand.
The carpal tunnel is formed by two layers, the carpal arch and the flexor retinaculum:
1. The carpal arch forms the floor of the carpal tunnel. It is concave on the palmar side and is formed laterally by the scaphoid and trapezium tubercles and medially by the hook of the hamate and the pisiform bones.
2. The flexor retinaculum forms the roof of the carpal tunnel. It is a strong, fibrous band that covers the carpal bones on the palmar side of the hand near the wrist. It is attached medially to the pisiform bone and the hook of the hamate bone. Laterally it attaches to the tubercle of the scaphoid bone, and to the medial part of the trapezium bone.

11661,201667,A 17-year-old girl is being investigated for primary amenorrhoea. On examination she has normal secondary sexual characteristics. An HSG shows there to be a blind ended vagina and she goes on to have an MRI scan. This shows complete aplasia of the uterus but the fallopian tubes and ovaries are well demonstrated. What is the most likely diagnosis?,SBA: Paediatrics,Mayer-Rokitansky-Kuster-Hauser (MRKH) syndrome,Uterus didelphys,Arcuate uterus,Septate uterus,"Bicornuate, bicervix uterus",A,97%,1%,1%,0%,0%,"Explanation:
Mullerian duct anomalies (MDA)
The two Mullerian ducts form separately then fuse in the first trimester to form all the structures between the upper vagina and the fallopian tubes. The final part of the amalgamation of the two sides is resorption of the central uterine septum.  There are various classification systems the scope of which is subspecialist. The following is provided for a gross overview only. Different anomalies occur depending on when during development the disruption to normality occurred.
       Aplasia/hypoplasia anomalies
Class I â Agenesis or hypoplasia:
Mayer-Rokitansky-Kuster-Hauser (MRKH) syndrome is an extreme subtype where there is complete aplasia of the upper third of the vagina and uterus. The fallopian tubes and ovaries will be seen normally. Primary amenorrhoea is the usual presentation.
Class II â Unicornuate: Banana like configuration of the remaining horn
Fusion anomalies
Class III - Didelphys: Non-fusion, two separate uterine horns, two separate cervices. All of the walls contain all of the layers of the normal uterus. The uterine cavities do not communicate with one another owing to the presence of a vaginal septum.
Class IV â Bicornuate: partial fusion, the septum separating the two horns consists of myometrium. There can be either one or two cervices depending on the degree of fusion but crucially the two uterine cavities do communicate with one another. Sometimes the appearance of a bicornuate uterus is referred to as âheart-shapedâ.
Reabsorption (of uterine septum) anomalies
Class V â Septate: partial fusion, a fibrous remnant septum remains. This is the most common anomaly presenting as infertility.
Class VI â Arcuate: a mild form of septate uterus but which is not associated with subfertility.
The crucial diagnosis to make is that of a septate uterus. Patients with a septate uterus can present with recurrent mid-term miscarriages due to implantation on the suboptimally vascularised septum. Surgical resection of this septum can significantly improve fertility chances. Distinguishing between didelphys and bicollis bicornuate uteri can be very challenging and is beyond the scope of this text.
There is no association with abnormalities of the external genitalia or ovaries since these derive from different embryological components but renal anomalies (agenesis, ectopia, fusion) can be found in around a third of patients and should be actively sought. Infertility is the primary clinical consequence of an MDA.
  Hysterosalpingogram (HSG)
HSGs are performed in the setting of infertility to confirm or refute tubal patency. It is not the ideal modality to diagnose MDAs since it provides information only on the internal contours of any patent cavities. Historically the intercornual angle was used to differentiate between a septate uterus (<75o) and a bicornuate or didelphys uterus (>105o) but this is no longer considered reliable. In addition an HSG will overlook obstructed hemisystems or functional remnants which do not communicate with the vagina.
  Ultrasound
Differentiating between fusion anomalies (bicornuate and didelphys) and reabsorption anomalies (septate and arcuate) depends on the fundal contour. Usually this can be well seen on ultrasound. Where there has been a failure of complete fusion a fundal cleft remains. This should be at least 1cm deep.  If the patient has a septate or arcuate uterus then fusion is complete so the fundus will be domed as is normal. A normal dome is greater than 5mm high.
  MRI
MRI is considered the gold standard for evaluating cases of MDA. The presence of menstrual blood products within an obstructed hemi uterus is, where present, readily seen as high signal on T1. Where a patient has two cervices these can be seen appearing like two âowl eyesâ when imaged axially to the vagina.
  Diethylstilbestrol (DES) exposure
DES was an artificial oestrogen used to treat women suffering from recurrent miscarriages. Owing to an association with clear cell carcinoma of the vagina and cervix its use was halted in the 1970s. It also caused shortening of the upper segment of the uterus which gave rise to a very characteristic T-shaped uterine cavity as seen on HSG. This was classed as a Class VII type of MDA.
Pertinent points:
Renal agenesis, ectopia and fusion present in 33% of patients
Aplastic uterus + normal fallopian tubes and ovaries = MRKH syndrome
Widely divergent horns + fundal cleft = fusion anomaly (didelphys or bicornuate)
Two cervices also known as owl eyes on MRI = either didelphys or bicollis bicornuate (difficult to tell them apart)
No communication between two uterine horns = didelphys
Domed fundus = reabsorption anomaly (Septate or arcuate)
Recurrent midterm miscarriages can be due to septate uterus and can be surgically resected to improve fertility.",True,"I chose number 5 because the MRI scan showed complete aplasia of the uterus, which is a characteristic of Mayer-Rokitansky-Kuster-Hauser (MRKH) syndrome. The other options are all congenital abnormalities of the uterus that can cause primary amenorrhoea, but none of them involve complete aplasia of the uterus.",2,,A,True,"I chose Mayer-Rokitansky-Kuster-Hauser (MRKH) syndrome as the most likely diagnosis because the clinical findings and imaging results align with the typical features of this condition. MRKH syndrome is characterized by congenital aplasia of the uterus and the upper part of the vagina, while the fallopian tubes and ovaries are usually unaffected. This matches the description given, where the patient has primary amenorrhoea, a blind-ended vagina, and an MRI scan showing complete aplasia of the uterus but normal fallopian tubes and ovaries.

The other options are less likely due to the following reasons:

1. Uterus didelphys: This condition involves the presence of two separate uteri and often two cervices, which is not consistent with the MRI findings of complete uterine aplasia.

2. Arcuate uterus: This is a mild uterine anomaly characterized by a small, inward indentation on the uterine fundus. It does not involve complete uterine aplasia, as seen in the MRI scan.

3. Septate uterus: This condition involves a septum that divides the uterine cavity into two parts. It does not involve complete uterine aplasia, as seen in the MRI scan.

5. Bicornuate, bicervix uterus: This condition involves a uterus that is divided into two separate cavities, each with its own cervix.

On ultrasound the scrotal skin appears thickened, the epididymis swollen and on colour Doppler imaging the flow within the left testicle is markedly increased. What is the most likely diagnosis?",SBA: Paediatrics,Reversed torsion,Acute torsion,Epididymo-orchitis,Non seminomatous germ cell tumour,Bell-clapper effect,A,40%,8%,40%,1%,11%,"Explanation:
Reversed torsion also known as torsion-detorsion sequence
Increased blood flow within the testicle is either caused by infection or reversed torsion (a testicular tumour can also show increased blood flow).
  Testicular torsion
Acute testicular torsion is a surgical emergency and in the prepubertal age bracket torsion is more common than infection as a cause of testicular pain. Even 180o of torsion can result in reduced blood flow, however complete ischemia is usually only seen in cases of >720o of torsion. Time is of essence; as early as three hours there will be some irreversibility within the testicle. Ideally the diagnosis should be made clinically and the patient taken straight to theatre without need for an ultrasound diagnosis. When an ultrasound is performed, either in the emergent setting or in cases of a misdiagnosis of epidiymo-orchitis the testicle can appear normal in echotexture, especially within the first 6 hours, thus a normal scrotal ultrasound does not rule torsion out. Diffuse hypoechogenicity is seen beyond this and heterogeneity suggests necrosis. Scrotal skin oedema occurs and is usually readily visible on ultrasound. With the advent of colour Doppler further information can be gleaned. Reduced signal in the spermatic cord and reduced testicular flow are both signs of torsion. Since venous occlusion occurs prior to arterial occlusion, apparently normal blood flow on colour Doppler does not exclude torsion.
  Bell-clapper deformity
This is the most common cause of testicular torsion. When the tunica vaginalis inserts high onto the spermatic cord, the testis is left hanging in a lateral position and takes on an appearance mimicking the central part of a bell, known as the clapper. In this position the testicle is more vulnerable to twisting on its axis with compromise to the blood flow leading to ischaemia.
  Epididymo-orchitis
Infection of the epididymis with concomitant infection of the testis is called epididymo-orchitis; it is seen most commonly in young adolescents with Chlamydia and Gonorrhoea accounting for most cases in this age range. In older patients E-coli and proteus are more likely to be responsible. Ultrasound is useful only in excluding testicular torsion as a cause of the pain (although a normal scrotal ultrasound does not exclude torsion), and investigating the possibility of abscess formation in cases refractory to antibiotic therapy. On ultrasound a reactive hydrocoele is often present and epididymal enlargement occurs. Colour Doppler flow can be used to demonstrate hyperaemia within the testicle and epididymis as would be expected for an infective process.
  Non-seminomatous germ cell tumours
Germ cell tumours are divided into seminomas and non-seminomatous varieties each of which accounts for approximately half of cases. They can often be found incidentally or subsequent to any trauma which might cause the patient to self-examine and discover a testicular lump. Alternatively they can present as a vague dull scrotal aching sensation with no lump.
They typically are found in relatively young patients. Testicular tumours can be diagnosed with a strong pre-test probability based solely on age as detailed in the table below. Ultrasound features vary slightly according to the exact tumour type.

 ",False,"Acute torsion is the most likely diagnosis in this case because the symptoms are consistent with it. The pain following a sports injury, the thickened scrotal skin, the swollen epididymis, and the increased flow within the left testicle are all indicative of acute torsion.

The thickened scrotal skin and swollen epididymis are common signs of inflammation, which is characteristic of epididymo-orchitis. Additionally, the markedly increased blood flow within the left testicle on color Doppler imaging further supports the presence of inflammation and infection, rather than the other options listed. 

Torsion (options 1 and 2) would typically present with decreased or absent blood flow on Doppler imaging, while a germ cell tumor (option 4) would not typically cause these acute inflammatory changes.

8896,201667,A 35-year-old man visits his GP after noticing that his stools have become very light in colour and difficult to flush away. On direct questioning he confirms he has also been losing weight recently. Blood tests show an iron-deficiency anaemia and he undergoes a small bowel follow through which is reported as showing flocculation and segmentation although the fold thickness is reported to be normal. Which of the following would best fit with these findings?,SBA: Gastrointestinal,Coeliac disease,Scleroderma,Mastocytosis,Lymphoma,Eosinophilic enteropathy,A,83%,7%,4%,1%,5%,"Explanation:
Fold thickness
Much is made on barium examinations, of the thickness of the folds and whether there is any nodularity. Such features can be helpful in teasing apart the possible diagnoses in similar cases.
Coeliac disease â dilatation without increase in fold thickness
Scleroderma â dilatation without loss of valvulae conniventes, prolonged transit time
Zollinger-Ellison syndrome â dilatation of the proximal small bowel due to hypersecretion
Small bowel lymphoma â fold thickening and lymph node enlargement
Mastocytosis â nodular fold thickening with sclerotic bone lesions
Crohn disease â nodular fold thickening
Whipple disease â thickened folds (+/- microndularity) without dilatation, with normal transit time
  Coeliac disease
Luminal sensitivity to gluten leads to autoimmune mediated atrophy of villi within the small bowel. Iron-deficiency anaemia, malabsorption and deficiency of the fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E and K) result. Classically on imaging there is jejunisation of the ileum (ie an increased number of ileal folds and a decreased number of jejunal folds) which is a reasonably specific sign to coeliac disease. Importantly however the fold thickness is not increased, in contrast to many of the possible differential diagnoses. On historic fluoroscopic examinations flocculation, segmentation are supposed to be typical and result from hypersecretion of fluid however modern barium preparations are less susceptible to these effects. The moulage sign (complete loss of jejunal folds such that the bowel wall appears smooth) is also quoted. A rare complication is cavitating mesenteric lymph node syndrome where lymph nodes within the small bowel mesentry show low attenuation on CT and characteristically have fat-fluid levels. In such cases the spleen may also be atrophic.
  Mastocytosis
Mast cells store histamine (among other things). Where they exist in excess the resultant symptoms fit with excess histamine release. Patients complain of nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, hypotension, flushing and abdominal pain. Asthma-type symptoms can also occur. On imaging hepatosplenomegaly and lymph node enlargement are common. The walls of the small bowel become thickened and malabsorption occurs too. Mastocytosis is also a cause of bony sclerosis.

  Eosinophilic enteropathy
This is a rare condition caused by infiltration of eosinophils into the wall of the small bowel. Patients often suffer from food allergies and experience multiple attacks of abdominal pain, diarrhoea and vomiting in a relapsing/remitting pattern. Blood eosinophil levels are usually raised. On imaging the folds of the small bowel can appear thickened.
  Scleroderma
Scleroderma is a multi-system connective tissue disease leading to fibrosis and loss of smooth muscle. In the gastrointestinal system this leads to the hidebound sign (similar but different to stacked coin sign which is seen in intramural haematoma where the folds are thickened) where, despite being dilated in calibre, the small bowel still retains the valvulae conniventes which would otherwise be effaced. This is thought to result from fibrosis of the longitudinal layer causing foreshortening along the long axis. In the small bowel there can also be the formation of square-shaped broad-based sacculations (true-diverticulae because they involve all layers of the bowel wall) on the mesenteric border of the bowel is seen owing to uneven atrophy of the smooth muscle there. A prolonged transit time would be ususal. Pseudosacculations (wide-mouthed diverticulae) are found in the colon but this time on the antimesenteric border. (The *only* anti-mesenteric diverticulum of the small bowel is a Meckel's diverticulum.)
    Small bowel lymphoma
Malignancies of the small bowel are rare but lymphoma is the most common of these. Coeliac disease, infection with H. Pylori and AIDs both predispose patients to developing small bowel lymphoma. Perhaps surprisingly patients do not present with obstruction even when the tumour burden is large, similarly neoplastic perforation is not common. Instead patients present with insidious symptoms or haemorrhage. On imaging there is (sometimes extensive) thickening of the bowel wall, often with associated lymph node enlargement.",True,"Coeliac disease is an autoimmune disorder in which the body's immune system mistakenly attacks the cells of the small intestine. This can lead to the symptoms described in the question, including light-colored stools, difficulty flushing them away, and weight loss. The small bowel follow through would likely show flocculation and segmentation, which are both common findings in cases of coeliac disease.",1,"3. A question about clinical reasoning, what is the appropriate management for the patient?",A,True,"I chose Coeliac disease because the symptoms and findings described in the question best fit with this condition. 

Coeliac disease is an autoimmune disorder that primarily affects the small intestine. It is triggered by the ingestion of gluten, a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. The symptoms mentioned, such as light-colored stools that are difficult to flush away, weight loss, and iron-deficiency anemia, are all common manifestations of Coeliac disease. These symptoms occur due to malabsorption of nutrients as a result of damage to the small intestine.

The small bowel follow-through findings of flocculation and segmentation are also suggestive of Coeliac disease. Flocculation refers to the clumping together of barium in the small bowel, and segmentation refers to the separation of barium into small segments along the bowel. These findings can be indicative of changes in the mucosal pattern due to Coeliac disease. Although the fold thickness is reported to be normal, this does not rule out the possibility of Coeliac disease, as the condition can present with varying degrees of severity.

The other options provided (Scleroderma, Mastocytosis, Lymphoma, and Eosinophilic enteropathy) can also affect the gastrointestinal system, but the combination of symptoms, blood test results, and small bowel follow-through findings make Coeliac disease the most likely diagnosis in this case.",A,False,B,True,"[{""page_content"": ""5) A 34-year-old woman with a history of steatorrhoea and weight loss\nundergoes a small bowel follow-through examination that demon-\nstrates dilatation of the proximal small bowel with \ufb02occulation\nand segmentation of the barium column.

The adnexae are poorly demonstrated. Of the following, which is the most likely diagnosis?","SBA: Genito urinary, Adrenal, Obstetrics & Gynaecology and Breast",Actinomycosis,Tuberculosis,Pseudomyxoma peritonei,Gonorrhoeal pelvic inflammatory disease,Indinavir phosphate calculus,A,65%,2%,3%,27%,2%,"Explanation:
Actinomycosis
Various species of actinomyces reside within the gastrointestinal and genitourinary tracts without causing any problems however opportunistic infections can occur when there is a breach to the mucosa. Thus pelvic actinomycosis tends to be consequent from events such as IUCD placement, surgery or trauma. Broadly speaking the imaging features will be those of pelvic inflammatory disease with pelvic fat stranding on CT, intraperitoneal free fluid and possible tubo-ovarian abscess formation, though more specifically this is an organism which crosses tissue planes readily and may appear to be behaving in an invasive manner. Free fluid of an increased density above 0-10HU suggests either an infective cause, haemorrhage or a high protein content.
  Pseudomyxoma peritonei
When a mucocoele of the appendix ruptures, mucein begins to accumulate within the peritoneal cavity within defined locules, eventually filling the entire space. On CT this appears as low attenuation ascites and scalloping of the liver by loculated collections allow the distinction from ascites proper. 
The condition can arise from intraperitoneal rupture of any mucein producing tumour including stomach, pancreas, colon or ovary, but those of the appendix account for the majority.
  Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID)
This is a coverall term applied to ascending infection of the genital tract. It encompasses endometritis, salpingitis, hydrosalpinx, pyosalpinx, and tubo-ovarian abscesses. Chlamydia and gonorrhoea account of most of the cases and the disease is most prevalent in sexually active young people. Imaging features are those secondary to inflammation with increased vascularity to the endometrium and small volume ascites. Inflammation is also seen on MRI as avid enhancement post contrast. Pelvic Inflammatory Disease can be complicated by a condition called Fitz-Hugh-Curtis syndrome where there is perihepatitis secondary to PID. 
  Tuberculous pelvic inflammatory disease
TB tends to affect the Fallopian tubes, causing many separate strictured points which causes a beaded appearance on HSG. On CT the presence of calcified pelvic lymph nodes may point at the diagnosis.
  Urinary tract calculi
Ureteric colic is common and urinary tract calculi are even more so. There are many metabolic disorders which increase the risk of developing urinary tract calculi but many patients do develop calculi without any underlying cause. Stones can obstruct at any point along the urinary tract however the three narrowest points which are most liable to obstruction are the pelviureteric junction (PUJ), the vesicoureteric junction (VUJ) and at the point where the ureters cross the pelvic brim. As the ureter peristalses a characteristic extremely severe âloin-to-groinâ pain is experienced. A CT KUB study is a low dose, non-contrast, exam designed specifically to investigate for urinary tract calculi. A standard CT abdo/pelvis confers three times as much radiation dose at the very least. Although A CT KUB has a very high sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of opaque urinary tract calculi it is distinctly suboptimal for the evaluation of other causes of abdominal pain. Unfortunately since its introduction it has become a popular request for many a supposed loin-to-groin pain presentation.

 ",False,"Pseudomyxoma peritonei is the most likely diagnosis because it is characterized by the presence of an IUCD and a soft tissue mass that is invading the bladder. This is consistent with the findings from the transvaginal ultrasound scan. Additionally, pseudomyxoma peritonei is a rare but serious condition that is caused by the spread of mucinous material from a tumor in the appendix. This could explain the raised inflammatory markers that the patient presented with.",2,,C,True,"I chose Actinomycosis (option 1) as the most likely diagnosis because the clinical presentation and imaging findings are consistent with this condition. Actinomycosis is a rare, chronic bacterial infection caused by Actinomyces species, which can lead to the formation of abscesses and sinus tracts. In the case of pelvic actinomycosis, the infection is often associated with the presence of an intrauterine contraceptive device (IUCD), as mentioned in the scenario.

The patient presents with fevers, acute pelvic pain, and raised inflammatory markers, which are all suggestive of an ongoing infection. The transvaginal ultrasound findings of an enlarged uterus with an IUCD, an apparent soft tissue mass invading the bladder, and poorly demonstrated adnexae further support the diagnosis of Actinomycosis.

The other options listed are less likely in this case:

2. Tuberculosis - While tuberculosis can involve the pelvic organs, it is less likely to be associated with the presence of an IUCD and the specific ultrasound findings described.
3. Pseudomyxoma peritonei - This is a rare condition characterized by the presence of mucin-producing tumors in the peritoneal cavity, which is not consistent with the clinical presentation and imaging findings in this case.
4. Gonorrhoeal pelvic inflammatory disease - Although it can cause pelvic pain and inflammation, it is less likely to present with the specific ultrasound findings described and the association with an IUCD.

The main differential diagnosis in this case is of multicystic dysplastic kidney but the most common cause of a neonatal renal mass is hydronephrosis. It is distinguishable from a multicystic dysplastic kidney by the fact that the apparent 'cysts' communicate with each other. On a MAG3 scan there should also be a small amount of activity within normal renal tissue; this normal renal tissue is completely absent in cases of multicystic dysplastic kidney.
  Multicystic dysplastic kidney
A Multicystic Dysplastic kidney is the second most common cause of a neonatal abdominal mass. The normal renal architecture is entirely replaced by a non-functioning mass of cysts separated from one another by fibrous tissue. The overall appearance is said to resemble a bunch of grapes. If unilateral, the condition can be asymptomatic or can present as recurrent urinary tract infections.

9341,201667,A 66-year-old man is admitted to ITU following complications during his recent coronary artery bypass grafting. He is intubated and ventilated but his doctors notice abdominal distension and elevation of his inflammatory markers and arterial blood sampling shows elevation of his serum lactate. He undergoes a CT scan which shows mucosal hyperenhancement and thumbprinting of the transverse colon and splenic flexure. Which of the following is the most likely explanation for these findings?,SBA: Gastrointestinal,Hypotension,Superior mesenteric artery thrombus,Inferior mesenteric artery thrombus,Coeliac axis stricture,Internal iliac artery stricture,A,45%,34%,21%,1%,0%,"Explanation:
The term hypotension is a little misleading. It is more accurate to say hypoperfusion or shock in the given scenario.
  Ischaemic colitis
Anything that compromises the vascular supply to the bowl can cause ischaemic colitis. This can be a thrombus, mechanical strangulation or a prolonged period of hypotension (most commonly encountered in the setting of an ITU patient). Mucosal hyperenhancement can be seen on CT as a consequence of increased permeability in the setting of a shocked bowel (other signs of shock include hyperenhancement of the adrenal glands and a slit like configuration to the inferior vena cava). Mucosal necrosis leads to oedema and haemorrhage with sloughing as the dead layer of cells falls away. Necrosis of the submucosal and muscularis layers leads to stricturing. Thumbprinting is a term derived from the appearances of a non-specifically oedematous bowel on a barium study. The same appearance on CT is less suggestive of the classic thumbprint indentations seen on fluoroscopy but the term is still used. Loss of integrity of the mucosa allows gas to enter the mesenteric vessels and thereby the portal venous system. Gas in the periphery of the liver is suggestive of portal venous gas (as opposed to aerobilia) and is a late sign of ischaemic bowel associated with a poor outcome.
The involvement of different areas of the bowel can give a clue as to the affected vessel. The watershed areas are those at the very fringes of supply from the different mesenteric arteries and are the first to be affected in low flow states.
Vascular territories
Watershed areas (splenic flexure and rectosigmoid junction) or the whole bowel
Hypoperfusion states
Caecum to splenic flexure
SMA
Splenic flexure to rectum
IMA
 ",False,"The most likely explanation for the findings of abdominal distension, elevation of inflammatory markers, and elevated serum lactate, as well as the CT scan findings of mucosal hyperenhancement and thumbprinting of the transverse colon and splenic flexure, is a superior mesenteric artery thrombus. This is because a thrombus in the superior mesenteric artery can cause a decrease in blood flow to the intestines, leading to ischemia and inflammation, which can cause the abdominal distension, elevated inflammatory markers, and elevated serum lactate. Additionally, the CT scan findings of mucosal hyperenhancement and thumbprinting of the transverse colon and splenic flexure are consistent with ischemia.",2,,B,False,"I chose option 2, ""Superior mesenteric artery thrombus,"" as the most likely explanation for these findings because the CT scan findings of mucosal hyperenhancement and thumbprinting of the transverse colon and splenic flexure suggest ischemic colitis. Ischemic colitis occurs when blood flow to the colon is reduced, leading to inflammation and injury to the colon wall.

The superior mesenteric artery (SMA) supplies blood to a large portion of the small intestine, the cecum, and the ascending and transverse colon. A thrombus, or blood clot, in the SMA can cause a significant reduction in blood flow to these areas, leading to ischemic colitis.

The other options are less likely to be the cause of these findings:

1. Hypotension: While hypotension can cause decreased blood flow to the colon, it would not typically cause the specific CT findings mentioned.
3. Inferior mesenteric artery thrombus: A thrombus in the inferior mesenteric artery (IMA) would primarily affect the descending and sigmoid colon, not the transverse colon and splenic flexure.
4. Coeliac axis stricture: A stricture in the coeliac axis would primarily affect the stomach, liver, and spleen, not the colon.

8941,201667,You are reporting a CT scan for a 49-year-old woman. There is a cystic mass in the tail of the pancreas measuring 4HU. The cysts themselves measure around 22mm in diameter and the overall mass diameter is 120mm. The patient has a raised CEA level and results from a fine needle aspiration performed later on in the interventional suite show low amylase levels of the aspirate. What is the most likely diagnosis?,SBA: Gastrointestinal,Mucinous cystadenoma,Intraductal papillary mucinous tumour,Adenocarcinoma,Serous cystadenoma,Caroli disease,A,77%,9%,3%,10%,1%,"Explanation:
Mucinous cystadenoma
Mucinous cystadenomas of the pancreas are subject to a similar adenoma-carcinoma sequence to colonic adenomas. Left long enough, all transform into mucinous cystadenocarcinomas which have a reasonably poor prognosis. Classcially patients are middle-aged women (mean age 47years). They are also cystic tumours but whose cysts are larger than for serous cystadenomas i.e. >20mm. The overall size of the mass can be quite large, averaging at around 10cm. They have a predilection for the pancreatic tail.
  Serous cystadenoma
These are largely benign tumours which classically occur in elderly ladies in their 70s. They have a sponge like appearance where innumerable small (<20mm) cysts sit around a characteristic central scar. The tumours can be very large, and may even present as a palpable mass, but usually are around 5cm in total diameter. Although they can be found in any part of the pancreas, there is a slight predisposition for the head of the pancreas. There is usually a central scar and calcifications can sometimes be seen within the scar.

  Intraductal Papillary Mucinous Tumour (IPMT) also known as Intraductal Papillary Mucinous Neoplasm (IPMN)
IPMNs can be either branch-duct type, main-duct type or mixed. The distinction between the types is highly prognistically significant since the vast majority of branch-duct type tumours are indolent whereas the majority of main-duct type tumours are malignant. Both types are found typically in patients in their 60s and men are more commonly affected than women. The presence of cystic dilatation of all or any of the main pancreatic duct should raise the suspicion of an IPMT. Branch duct-type lesions appear as multilocular cystic masses most commonly in the head or uncinate process of the pancreas.
  Predictors of malignancy
Branch duct type
Main duct type
>4cm in overall size
Pancreatic duct >9mm in diameter
Thick, irregular septae
Mural nodule
  On ECRP, patients with a main duct type IPMN will have thick mucus bulging out of the ampulla of Vater however MRCP is generally considered the gold standard for investigation (over ERCP) since a branch duct type lesion may be missed at ERCP due to mucous plugging of the relevant duct. Anatomically there must be communication with the pancreatic ductal system even if at the time of diagnosis there is mucous plugging preventing functional drainage.
  Choledochal cyst
Reflux of pancreatic enzymes into the common bile duct leads to weakening of the wall of the common bile duct [CBD] (+/- the common hepatic duct) and thereafter aneurysmal dilatation termed a choledochal cyst. There are five different subtypes. Patients are mostly diagnosed in childhood. If undiagnosed to adulthood patients present with a triad of episodic jaundice, right upper quadrant pain and a right upper quadrant mass.
Type I â This is by far the most common version. The common bile duct is affected either focally or along its entire length.
Type II â A true diverticulum of the CBD
Type III â Focal dilatation of the CBD contained within the wall of the duodenum. This type is also called a choledochocoele. They present slightly later with most patients being in their 30s at the time of diagnosis and can be seen as a duodenal filling defect on barium follow-through studies.
Type IV â The intrahepatic and extrahepatic biliary ducts are affected
Type V â The intraheptic ducts are affected alone. This is termed Caroli disease however there is some discrepancy in the literature as to whether this can be called a type V choledochal cyst or whether it is a separate disease in its own right. Caroli disease (cavernous ectasia of the intrahepatic ducts) can be inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion. When present it is quite striking on imaging with saccular dilatation of most of the larger intrahepatic biliary ducts alongside focal strictures giving a beaded appearance. There is an association with medullary sponge kidney and patients are at significantly increased risk of developing cholangiocarcinoma.
  Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma
Unfortunately pancreatic adenocarcinoma has a poor prognosis and is also reasonably common. At the time of diagnosis only 10% have surgically resectable disease and the 5-year survival rate is pitifully low at 2-3%. The classical specific presentation is with painless jaundice (Courvoisier sign â painless jaundice and a right upper quadrant mass is unlikely to be caused by gallstones) however most patients actually present with vague abdominal or right upper quadrant pains. The tumour markers usually found are CEA and Ca19-9. Smokers, obese patients and those with a relevant oncological family history of hormonal cancers are at increased risk of developing the cancer, as are those suffering from cancer syndrome such as HNPCC (hereditary non polyposis colorectal cancer). On ultrasound the tumour will show low reflectivity compared to any adjacent normal pancreatic tissue. On CT the masses tend to enhance poorly.
The key to management is operability. Involvement of various different local structures excludes or potentially excludes some patients from surgical management as follows:
  Operable
Borderline operable
Palliative
Duodenum
Veins â IVC, SMV and Portal vein
SMA
Spleen
Arteries â aorta, splenic artery if further than 1cm from origin,
Coeliac axis
 ",True,"Mucinous cystadenoma is the most likely diagnosis in this case because the cysts are large and the CEA level is elevated. Additionally, the fine needle aspiration results showed low amylase levels, which is consistent with a mucinous cystadenoma.",2,,A,True,"I chose option 5, Mucinous cystadenoma, based on the information provided in the question. The cystic mass in the tail of the pancreas with a low attenuation value (4HU) and a large diameter (120mm) is consistent with a cystic lesion. The patient also has a raised CEA (carcinoembryonic antigen) level, which is often associated with mucinous tumors.

The fine needle aspiration results show low amylase levels in the aspirate, which makes it less likely to be a pseudocyst or a serous cystadenoma (option 3). Intraductal papillary mucinous tumors (option 1) typically involve the pancreatic ducts and may have higher amylase levels. Adenocarcinoma (option 2) usually presents as a solid mass rather than a cystic lesion. Caroli disease (option 4) is a rare congenital condition characterized by cystic dilatation of the intrahepatic bile ducts, which is not consistent with the findings in this case.

This is the classic description of a juvenile angiofibroma, if the demographic hasnât already given the answer away. They are vascular tumours and interventionalists have a significant role to play in their management. They are supplied by the internal maxillary artery and ascending pharyngeal artery. Care must be taken during embolisation not to affect any branches from the internal maxillary artery which go on to supply the eye in order not to cause blindness. Classically these tumours cause erosion of the medial pterygoid plate and are seen on MRI as flow voids on T2w. Of the other answers an inverted papilloma would cause a degree of bony destruction, an SCC would show aggressive features and would be unlikely given the demographic. A mucocoele would be found within a sinus and classically shows an absence of air in that sinus in contrast to an antrochoanal polyp where the sinus is often incompletely opacified.

Lunotriquetral
Injury to this ligament results in VISI.
Injury to this ligament also causes midcarpal dislocation (similar to lunate dislocation and also associate with triquetral fractures).

14928,201667,"A 51-year-old lady is screened for breast cancer as part of the NHS breast screening service. A lesion is seen, and the patient is recalled for further magnified views. Which views should be taken?","SBA: Genito urinary, Adrenal, Obstetrics & Gynaecology and Breast",CC and lateral,MLO and CC,MLO and lateral,"Lateral, MLO and CC",Lateral only,A,30%,25%,5%,19%,21%,"Explanation:
MLO and CC are the standard views performed at screening.
If further views are required these are usually decided on a case-by-case basis.
Of the answers provided:
MLO and CC - the screening views, no point in repeating with no change
MLO and lateral - the lateral would be useful, the MLO would not add anything
Lateral, MLO and CC - if the CC was rolled then the lateral and the rolled CC would be useful but the MLO is superfluous
Lateral only - this would be most useful if the mass had suspected teacup calcifications.
  A lateral and a rolled-CC would be most useful to evaluate this patient further. The question unfortunately does not specify either way whether this answer intends the patient to undergo a rolled CC view however the reasons against the other answers are detailed above.
A true lateral view can help demonstrate suspected teacup calcifications are teacup calcifications. Compression views are used to interrogate suspicious calcifications seen on mammograms further.
A rolled CC view can help separate out structures to prove that the 'mass' seen on the original mammogram was a summation shadow, or to confirm the presence of a mass.
  Teacup calcifications
Teacup calcifications are caused by liquid milk of calcium within fibrocystic change. On mammography they appear as small curvilinear thin calcifications resembling the fluid level in a teacup on lateral views and rounded on a craniocaudal view, like a teacup viewed from above. Although teacup calcifications are typically benign in nature and suggestive of only fibrocystic changes they must be distinguished from suspicious calcifications. Thus the best views for confirming the presence of teacup calcifications would be a true lateral, as opposed to an oblique lateral, and a CC view. Granted the CC view should already have been performed during screening but the point of this question is essentially âwhat are the best views with which to see teacup calcificationâ. In practice if views are being repeated, they would be as magnified views of an area of interest.",False,"The views that should be taken for further magnified views of the lesion are the MLO (mediolateral oblique) and lateral views.

9671,201667,A 15-year-old boy is referred to the paediatric services at his local hospital having complained of a sore knee for the last few months. An x-ray is requested which shows a 3.2cm lytic lesion within the proximal tibial epiphysis. It has a thin sclerotic rim. What is the most likely diagnosis?,SBA: Paediatrics,Chondroblastoma,Brodie abscess,Osteoid osteoma,Osteoblastoma,Enchondroma,A,61%,18%,3%,13%,5%,"Explanation:
Chondroblastoma
Largely speaking these tumours only arise in epiphyses or epiphyseal equivalent bones (such as the patella) and are therefore confined, in-terms of age, to children or adolescents. They can present in a fairly indolent fashion with pain, swelling and tenderness preceding diagnosis by weeks, if not months. They typically occur in the long bones, around two thirds are found in the leg and half are found around the knee. On x-ray they appear as a lucent, lobulated lesion with a thin sclerotic margin. Surrounding oedema, if present, can be surprisingly florid, even leading to an overestimation of the extent of the underlying lesion. Calcification associated with the lesion does occur but is better appreciated with CT.
  Brodie abscess
The best explanation of these abscesses is of a smoldering osteomyelitis. Most commonly they are caused by staphylococcus aureus (or Salmonella in patients with sickle cell disease) and in children they arise in the metaphyses and the presence of the growth plate acts as a physical barrier hindering spread to the epiphyses. In very young children (<18 months) there are blood vessels traversing the growth plate and thus abscesses can form in both the metaphyses and the epiphyses. In patients where the growth plates have fused, vessel cross the site of the old growth plate and the epiphysis can become infected.
Age
Site of infection
<18m
Metaphysis + epiphysis
>18m â before fusion of growth plate
Metaphysis
 After fusion of growth plate
Epiphysis
  On x-ray a lucent lesion with a sclerotic margin should raise the possibility of a Brodie abscess and the presence of a lucent channel extending towards the growth plate is considered pathognomonic. The diagnosis is usually confirmed with MRI where the sclerotic bone returns little signal on T2 weighted sequences but the adjacent inner granulation tissue returns high signal. The combination of the two is referred to as the âdouble-lineâ effect. The rim of granulation tissue can enhance with gadolinium but the absence of enhancement does not rule the condition out. Adjacent bone marrow is often oedematous (high on T2, low on T1).
  Osteoid osteoma
These are small benign tumours but which can be quite symptomatic, classically with pain relieved by aspirin. The majority form in the diaphyses of long bones but the posterior elements of the spine is another classic location.
The radiolucent nidus and symptoms of night pain in a young patient point to either an osteoid osteoma or an osteoblastoma. The final diagnosis comes down to size: <1.5 cm is definitely an osteoid osteoma, and >2 cm is definitely an osteoblastoma. There is a nasty grey area somewhere between the two sizes.
On x-ray the radiolucent nidus may not be fully appreciated and the abnormality which is picked up will be the consequential sclerotic solid periosteal reaction. In the spine there may be a painful scoliosis concave towards the lesion as a result of adjacent muscular spasm. CT is used to confirm the diagnosis as the nidus is readily appreciable.
  Osteoblastoma
Osteoblastomas are quite rare, even for bone tumours. To all intent and purposes they can be considered as large osteoid osteomas. They occur in slightly older patients than osteoid osteomas but most patients are still under 30-years-old. Around a third arise in the posterior elements of the spine, sometimes giving a painful scoliosis, a further third can be found in the long bones and roughly the remaining third arise in the small bones of the hands and feet.
  Enchondroma
As the name suggests, this is a cartilage forming tumour showing ground-glass matrix and ring or arc calcifications (as with all cartilage forming tumours). Patients are typically young (10-30 years) and the lesions are typically found in the hands (although they can form anywhere in the body. In the hands they are unusual to be found in the terminal phalanges). They are thought to derive from ongoing growth of small foci of cartilage which have become displaced from the growth plate. They can expand the cortex but, unless presenting as a fracture, should be painless and therefore are often an incidental diagnosis. Although they are benign tumours, malignant degeneration to a chondrosarcoma can occur.",False,"Osteoid osteoma is the most likely diagnosis for this 15-year-old boy based on the description of the x-ray results. Osteoid osteomas are benign bone tumors that typically occur in children and young adults. They are characterized by a lytic lesion with a thin sclerotic rim, which is what was observed in this case. Additionally, they are most commonly found in the proximal tibial epiphysis, which is the location of the lesion in this case.",2,,C,True,"I chose option 2, Chondroblastoma, because the description of the x-ray findings matches the typical characteristics of this type of lesion. Chondroblastoma is a rare, benign bone tumor that usually occurs in the epiphysis of long bones, such as the proximal tibia, as described in the case. The age of the patient (15-year-old boy) is also consistent with the typical age range for Chondroblastoma, which usually affects adolescents and young adults.

What is the most likely diagnosis?,SBA: Paediatrics,Hyaline membrane disease,Transient tachypnoea of the newborn,Meconium aspiration,Pulmonary interstitial emphysema,Bronchopulmonary dysplasia,A,82%,5%,3%,6%,4%,"Explanation:
Of the five main respiratory conditions of the neonate the differential diagnosis can be narrowed based on gestational age.  The presence of hyperinflation can also be useful but may not always be present where feasible so should not be used as an absolute discriminator. If present, it is useful.
Meconium aspiration
Meconium is sticky and causes a chemical pneumonitis in the lungs, seen as patchy consolidation. In addition small globules of meconium entering bronchi and bronchioles of a decreasing calibre act as a ball-valve mechanism and lead to air trapping; thus the lung volumes of a baby with meconium aspiration may be increased. Air bronchograms are notably absent. The typical baby in a meconium aspiration situation is post-term.
  Transient tachypnoea of the newborn (TTN)
The classical patient for TTN would be a term baby born by caesarean section to a diabetic mother. During normal vaginal delivery the compression of the baby as it descends the birth canal acts to squeeze fluid out from its lungs. This mechanism is all but absent during a caesarean section.  Consequently these babies are born with an excess of retained fluid. The CXR of an affected baby will show bilateral symmetrical air space opacification with air bronchograms, fluid in the fissures and pleural effusions. This peaks in severity at 24hrs but resolves by three days.
  Hyaline Membrane Disease (HMD) also known as surfactant deficient disease (SDD)
It is to reduce the likelihood of this disease developing that a woman in pre-term labour will be offered a steroid injection. The steroids help the neonatal lungs to develop faster and increase the likelihood of their being able to produce surfactant once delivered. Where there is surfactant deficiency the alveoli collapse. The CXR will show a granular opacification throughout both lungs which progresses to bilateral ground glass opacification with air bronchograms. If exogenous surfactant is given to the baby there may be asymmetrical improvement in the appearances depending on how much reaches each lung. Of note HMD does not cause pleural effusions. Finally a normal CXR at 6hrs post delivery excludes HMD.
  Pulmonary interstitial emphysema (PIE)
As the name would suggest, this disease is diagnosed when there is air within the interstitial tissues of the lungs. It is caused by alveolar rupture due to the barotrauma of mechanical ventilation or positive airway pressure.  It can be associated with hyaline membrane disease and is prevalent in infants of a low birth weight. Complications such as pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum can be severe and acutely life threatening. Radiographically there is hyperinflation and lucencies in either a cystic pattern or streaks emanating from the hila and following the direction of the bronchi/bronchioles. It is treated with high frequency oscillation ventilation which is less traumatic to the lungs.
  Bronchopulmonary dysplasia
This also occurs due to barotrauma in ventilated neonates but is a more gradual process, occurring later on in the babyâs life. Typically (but not exclusively) the baby is premature (hence requiring ventilation). It only usually occurs after the baby in question has received ventilation of >21% oxygen for longer than 28 days. The lungs are hyperinflated and what starts off as ground glass opacification becomes complete opacification with air bronchograms in a few days. After 30 days it can be seen as coarse linear lucencies, described as radiating from the hila, with focal emphysematous change. Mikity syndrome has similar features but occurs in term infants who have not received mechanical assistance.",True,"I chose Hyaline Membrane Disease because it is a common cause of respiratory distress in premature babies. It is caused by immature lungs, which are unable to produce enough surfactant, leading to poor oxygenation and collapse of the alveoli. The CXR findings of patchy ground glass opacification with air bronchograms are consistent with this diagnosis.",2,"The question falls under category 2: A question about clinical judgement, what is the correct diagnosis?",A,True,"I chose option 3, Hyaline Membrane Disease (HMD), because the clinical scenario and the findings on the chest X-ray are most consistent with this diagnosis. HMD, also known as Respiratory Distress Syndrome (RDS), is a common cause of respiratory distress in premature infants, particularly those born before 32 weeks of gestation. The baby in this case was born prematurely at 28 weeks due to placental abruption, which puts the baby at a higher risk for HMD.

The chest X-ray findings of patchy ground-glass opacification in a bilateral symmetrical distribution with air bronchograms are classic for HMD. This appearance is due to the lack of surfactant in the immature lungs, leading to alveolar collapse and atelectasis. Surfactant deficiency results in poor lung compliance, making it difficult for the baby to breathe, and necessitating intubation and ventilation, as described in the clinical scenario.

The other options are less likely in this case:

1. Transient tachypnea of the newborn (TTN) typically occurs in term or near-term infants and is characterized by rapid breathing due to delayed clearance of fetal lung fluid. The chest X-ray findings in TTN usually show fluid in the fissures and prominent perihilar streakiness, which is different from the findings described in this case.

2. Meconium aspiration usually occurs in term or post-term infants, and the chest X-ray findings include patchy infiltrates and hyperinflation, which are not consistent with the described findings in this case.

4. Pulmonary interstitial emphysema (PIE) is a complication of mechanical ventilation and is characterized by the presence of air in the pulmonary interstitium. The chest X-ray findings in PIE include cystic lucencies, which are not described in this case.

5. Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a chronic lung disease that affects premature infants who have been treated with oxygen and mechanical ventilation. BPD usually develops after several weeks of life, and the chest X-ray findings include hyperinflation and coarse interstitial markings.

14460,201667,The renal arteries arise from the aorta at which vertebral level? Select ONE answer only.,"SBA: Genito urinary, Adrenal, Obstetrics & Gynaecology and Breast",L2,L1,L3,L4,L5,A,62%,29%,8%,1%,0%,"Explanation:
The arterial supply to the kidneys is from the renal arteries, two fast flowing arteries that arise from the abdominal aorta at the L2 vertebral level. As the abdominal aorta is situated slightly to the left of the midline the right renal artery is longer than the left. The kidneys receive approximately 20% of the cardiac output.
After arising from the aorta, the right renal artery passes behind the inferior vena cava, the right renal vein, the head of the pancreas, and the second part of the duodenum as it travels to the kidney. The left renal artery passes behind the left renal vein, the body of the pancreas and the splenic vein as it travels to the kidney. The left renal artery is crossed anteriorly by the inferior mesenteric vein.
The renal arteries then enter the kidney at the hila of the kidneys, which lie approximately in the transpyloric plane at the L1 vertebral level. At the hila the renal arteries divide into four or five segmental branches.
Each segmental branch divides to form the interlobar arteries that are situated on either side of every renal pyramid. These interlobar arteries then undergo further division to form the arcuate arteries.
The interlobular arteries are then given off at right angles from the side of the arcuate arteries, and head into the cortical substance. Once within the cortex a final division takes place with the interlobular arteries dividing to form the efferent arterioles.
In the outer two-thirds of the cortex, the efferent arterioles form the peritubular network. The inner third of the cortex is supplied by long, straight arteries known as the vasa recta.

You have been asked to perform an ultrasound scan on the transplanted kidney to confirm a diagnosis of renal vein thrombosis. Which of the following findings would you expect to allow you to make the diagnosis?","SBA: Genito urinary, Adrenal, Obstetrics & Gynaecology and Breast",Reversed diastolic flow,Increased resistive index,Decreased resistive index,Tardus-parvus pulse,Peak systolic velocity >150 cm/s,A,81%,11%,1%,5%,1%,"Explanation:
An increased resistive index is a sensitive finding for the presence of pathology but it is relatively non-specific.
  Renal vein thrombosis
Transplant kidneys are most likely to develop renal vein thrombosis within their first week. Clinically the patient will become anuric with a tender and swollen kidney. Ultrasound is the mainstay of diagnosis and can show thrombus within the renal vein, however the diagnosis is usually made on the basis of the Doppler findings. Since the outflow from the kidney is obstructed the resistive index (the difference in velocity between systole and diastole divided by the systolic velocity) will increase to above 0.7. The resistive index, however, is not specific as it also increases in renal artery stenosis. Furthermore the arterial waveform changes and there may even be reversal of end-diastolic flow in the renal artery. This is seen as inversion of the colour Doppler trace.
  Renal artery stenosis
There are three main aetiologies of renal artery stenosis. The most prevalent is atherosclerosis. Fibromuscular dysplasia is the second most common and is classically given as affecting a relatively young woman with beading (string of beads) of the mid and distal renal arteries seen, for which the management is angioplasty. Finally a small number of cases are secondary to a variety of conditions such as Buergerâs disease, Takayasuâs disease and neurofibromatosis.
The significance of diagnosis of atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis is in avoiding the use of ACE inhibitors. The ASTRAL trial showed that there was no long term benefit of stenting the stenoses over best medical management, although there was still a reduction in the number of episodes of flash pulmonary oedema experienced by the patients.
Slightly different numbers are given in the different sources.

 ",False,"The peak systolic velocity >150 cm/s is a reliable indicator of renal vein thrombosis in transplanted kidneys. This is because the peak systolic velocity is the highest velocity of blood flow through the renal vein and is usually lower than 150 cm/s in normal kidneys.

Renal vein thrombosis occurs when a blood clot forms in the renal vein, which can lead to impaired blood flow and compromised kidney function.

However, in the case of renal vein thrombosis, the blood flow is obstructed by the clot, causing the diastolic flow to reverse direction.

She undergoes an MRI scan and the mass returns high signal on T2 although there are some low intensity bands running through it.

  Hepatoblastoma
Most hepatoblastomas are found in children under the age of 3 but they can occur at any point in childhood. They are the third most common abdominal tumour in children. Presentation is typically with an abdominal mass and weight loss and the serum AFP is often markedly elevated. Some may produce hormones and thereby precocious puberty but this is rare. Coarse calcification is seen in around a third of cases. On ultrasound the mass will be large and heterogenous. On CT they appear as a predominantly low attenuation mass seeming to consist of multiple confluent nodules. Often the rim of the mass enhances well on CT. On MRI they are, for the most part, high in signal on T2 weighted sequences but can show low intensity fibrous bands running through them.
  Infantile haemangioendothelioma
These are benign lesions which can cause elevation of the serum AFP but the vast majority occur in babies under the age of 6 months. Around half of cases are associated with the presence of a cutaneous haemangioma. They are large vascular tumours and on imaging behave as might be expected of a haemangioma with low echogenicity on ultrasound, peripheral enhancement with gradual filling in on CT and flow voids on MRI. Calcifications can be seen with these lesions but they are finer, more granular calcifications; not coarse. Owing to their size they often cause significant right to left shunting of blood resulting in congestive heart failure. Thrombocytopaenia due to platelet trapping (known as the Kasabach-Merritt sequence). N.B. these lesions should not be confused with epithelioid haemangioendotheliomas which occur in adults.
  Wilms tumour also known as a nephroblastoma
This is the most common abdominal mass in children under the age of 8. There are reasonably strong associations with renal anomalies, genital anomalies, aniridia and Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (although the last of these also has an association with neuroblastoma). Presentation is usually with an abdominal mass and/or pain.
10% tumour â Wilms
Calcification
Vascular invasion
Bilateral
Lung metastases
Poor histology
  On imaging the masses are usually heterogenous. Cystic areas can often be seen secondary to areas of necrosis. The claw sign occurs when there is a rim of normal renal tissue extending part of the way around the mass. A Wilms tumour is often described as enhancing but less so than the adjacent normal renal parenchyma.
  Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) also known as Hepatoma
There is a peak in the incidence of HCCs in the paediatric age range at around age 13. The central scar of an HCC is a specific feature which can help separate it from potential differential diagnoses. Although calcification of this central scar is seen in around a quarter of cases there tends to be less calcification in HCCs than there would be in a hepatoblastoma.
Although metastases are the most common cause of malignant hepatic lesions, hepatocellular carcinoma is the most common primary hepatic malignancy. It usually arises on a background of cirrhosis of any cause. Patients with any of the hepatitis viruses, alcoholic cirrhosis, haemochromatosis, and Wilson disease are all at risk. Carcinogens such as thorotrast and aflatoxin also predispose to HCC formation. Serum alpha fetoprotein levels are often raised, in contrast with cholangiocarcinomas which are one of the main differential diagnoses.
On imaging HCCs can have a variety of appearances. A large irregular mass with satellite nodules is the most common finding but a diffuse infiltrative version can also occur. Since HCCs derive their blood supply from the hepatic artery they show arterial enhancement on CT with washout on later phases. On ultrasound HCCs tend to be hyperechoic when compared to the rest of the liver and on MRI they show variable signal intensity on both T1 and T2 but arterial enhancement with venous washout can again be seen once Gadolinium has been given.
  Hepatic abscess
Liver abscesses can occur in children, for much the same reasons as they arise in adults, although they are far more common in adults. Pyogenic abscesses result from bacteria accessing the liver via the biliary tree, septicaemia, direct spread, trauma or during a liver procedure. Patients are usually in their 60s. Amoebic abscesses occur in slightly younger patients (40s) and tend to result from spread of amoebae from the colon via the portal venous system. On ultrasound they appear as a hypoechoic mass with posterior acoustic enhancement. Internal debris may be apparent. On CT they are usually low in attenuation with rim enhancement. MRI signal characteristics are dependent on the protein content of the pus but usually abscesses return little T1 signal and, owing to their fluid nature, return high signal on T2 weighted sequences. It is said that amoebic abscesses are usually found to be contiguous with the liver capsule.",True,"The most likely diagnosis based on the given information is hepatoblastoma. This is because the elevated serum AFP level, the presence of a mass in the right lobe of the liver, and the high signal on T2 with low intensity bands running through it are all consistent with hepatoblastoma.",2,,A,True,"I chose Hepatoblastoma as the most likely diagnosis for the following reasons:

1. Patient's age: Hepatoblastoma is the most common primary liver tumor in children, typically affecting children under the age of 5. The patient in this case is a 6-year-old girl, which falls within the typical age range for this tumor.

2. Elevated serum AFP level: An increase in serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) is a common finding in patients with hepatoblastoma. This tumor marker is often used to monitor the response to treatment and for detecting recurrence.

3. Imaging findings: The presence of a mass in the right lobe of the liver with coarse calcification on CT scan and high signal intensity on T2-weighted MRI images with some low-intensity bands are consistent with the imaging features of hepatoblastoma.

The other options listed are less likely due to the patient's age, elevated AFP levels, and the specific imaging findings:

- Hepatic abscess: This condition is typically associated with fever, pain, and leukocytosis. The imaging findings would likely show a fluid-filled cavity with peripheral enhancement, which is not described in this case.
- Wilms tumor: This is a kidney tumor and would not present as a liver mass.
- Haemangioendothelioma: This is a rare vascular tumor that can occur in the liver, but it typically presents with multiple nodules and is not associated with elevated AFP levels.

Select ONE answer only.",SBA: Paediatrics,Lymphoma,Normal thymus,Germ cell tumour,Duplication cyst,Askin Tumour,A,86%,8%,4%,1%,2%,"Explanation:
Lymphoma
This is the most common anterior mediastinal mass in children. It may be difficult to differentiate a lymphoma from normal thymus, particularly in a patient younger than 10 years of age. Associated lymphadenopathy (i.e. cervical) can be the key to distinguishing the two pathologies. Calcification is rare prior to any treatment but can be a feature of lymphoma which has been treated.
  Germ Cell Tumour
This often causes a large anterior mediastinal mass. It can be subdivided into Teratoma (usually cystic with fat and calcification), seminoma (bulky and lobulated) and Non-seminomatous Germ Cell Tumour (haemorrhage and necrosis).
  Duplication cyst
These are very rarely found in the anterior mediastinum, usually being posterior mediastinal (neuroenteric) or middle mediastinal (bronchogenic, enteric).
  Askin Tumour
These heterogenous tumours are part of the Ewing Sarcoma spectrum. Patients are often in their early teens. Askin tumours displace rather than invade adjacent mediastinal structures although rib destruction is common and is a fact which can help distinguish it from a pleuropulmonary blastoma which is another cause of a large mediastinal mass, albeit usually found in babies under the age of 2, but which does not cause rib destruction.",False,"Germ cell tumours are the most common type of anterior mediastinal mass in children and adolescents. They typically have a lobulated outline, with no invasion of adjacent structures, and enlarged lymph nodes in the included cervical chains. They can also have no calcification, fat, or haemorrhage within the mass. These features are consistent with the description of the mass in this case, making germ cell tumour the most likely diagnosis.",2,,A,True,"I chose option 2, Lymphoma, because the description of the CT findings matches the typical characteristics of a lymphoma. The large, lobulated anterior mediastinal mass with enlarged cervical lymph nodes indicates a possible malignant process, which is consistent with lymphoma. The absence of calcification, fat, or hemorrhage within the mass further supports this diagnosis. 

The other options are less likely based on the given information:
1. Normal thymus: A normal thymus would not present as a large mass with enlarged cervical lymph nodes.
3. Germ cell tumour: While germ cell tumors can occur in the mediastinum, they often have calcification or fat within the mass, which is not mentioned in this case.
4. Duplication cyst: Duplication cysts are typically well-defined cystic lesions, not large lobulated masses with enlarged lymph nodes.
5. Askin Tumour: Askin Tumour, a type of primitive neuroectodermal tumor, is a rare and aggressive malignancy.

13910,201667,A 70-year-old man undergoes an MRI scan of the base of his skull. He has previously undergone surgery for a left sided cholesteatoma and the surgeon is concerned there may be a recurrence. Within the surgical cavity on the left there is a mass which does not enhance on the post-contrast sequences but does restrict diffusion. What is the most likely diagnosis? Select ONE answer only.,SBA: Central Nervous and Head & Neck,Recurrent cholesteatoma,Post-operative fluid,Granulation tissue,Otitis media,Cholesterol granuloma,A,75%,2%,11%,4%,8%,"Explanation:
Cholesteatomas are difficult to manage as they have a high recurrence rate. Imaging has a significant role to play in the management of recurrent cholesteatomas; distinguishing recurrence from post-operative granulation tissue or fluid is important.
  Diagnosis Restricts Diffusion Enhances
Recurrent cholesteatoma Yes No
Granulation tissue No Yes
Fluid No No
  Post-contrast sequences for recurrent cholesteatomas require a delay of around 45 minutes from giving the contrast to acquiring images as the granulation tissue is slow to take up contrast. This has obvious down-sides to any modern day busy MRI schedule. However since the management of post-operative granulation tissue and post-operative fluid is largely identical, namely expectant, it is not important to differentiate the one from the other. Thus findings on diffusion weighted sequences are the most important thing in post-operative cholesteatoma imaging.
  Cholesteatoma
Cholesteatomas (Acquired or congenital) are histolologically epidermoid cysts. On imaging the finding of non-dependant soft tissue and bony erosion within the middle ear is typical for a cholesteatoma.
There are two types of acquired cholesteatoma:
Pars flaccida (80%) â classically erodes the scutum and extends superiorly
Pars tensa (20%) â classically erodes the ossicles, extending medially
  These refer to the two parts of the tympanic membrane from which they arise.
  Image Â© Medical Exam Prep
  In due course, if left unattended, a cholesteatoma will expand to fill the entire middle ear. Prior to this point they can be seen as non-dependant soft tissue within the middle ear. Dependant soft tissue within the middle ear suggests the presence of fluid or pus and the diagnosis of a middle ear infection. Once a cholesteatoma has filled the middle ear completely however no gas remains from which to discern dependency.
There are a number of theories as to how cholesteatomas arise. One theory is that following a perforation of the tympanic membrane entry of desquamated stratified keratinised squamous epithelium from the external auditory canal into the middle ear is permitted. There it adheres to the tympanic membrane and proliferates unrelentingly causing a soft tissue mass to form and eventually leading to bony erosion of the ossicles, scutum and/or other parts of the middle ear.
A congenital cholesteatoma behaves in a similar manner but is present from birth due to an aberrant location of a tiny island of keratinised squamous epithelium.
  Cholesterol granuloma
A cholesterol granuloma occurs as a sequela of recurrent bouts of otitis media. Haemorrhage within the middle ear leads to the formation of granulation tissue. On imaging this is seen as non-specification of the middle ear on CT. Bony changes can occur chronically with bony expansion, or displacement and even destruction of the ossicles. The signals characteristics on MRI are therefore important to distinguish it from a cholesteatoma. Whereas a cholesteatoma on MRI is isointense to brain parenchyma on T1, a cholesterol granuloma will show high signal in the middle ear on T1 due to the paramagnetic effects of methaemoglobin. On clinical examination the ENT surgeon may report a bulging blue tympanic membrane. This is classical. Dehiscence of the jugular bulb is an important differential diagnosis to exclude as this will also give a blue tympanic membrane on examination but the management is radically different!",True,"I chose this answer because a cholesteatoma is a type of benign tumor that is characterized by abnormal skin growth in the middle ear, which can lead to recurrent infections and hearing loss. The MRI scan showed a mass that did not enhance on post-contrast sequences but did restrict diffusion, which is consistent with the characteristics of a cholesteatoma.",2,,A,True,"I chose option 4, ""Recurrent cholesteatoma,"" because the clinical history and MRI findings are consistent with this diagnosis. The patient has a history of surgery for a left-sided cholesteatoma, and the surgeon is concerned about a possible recurrence. Cholesteatoma is a noncancerous growth of skin cells in the middle ear or mastoid, which can cause complications if left untreated.

The MRI findings mentioned in the question, such as a mass within the surgical cavity that does not enhance on post-contrast sequences but does restrict diffusion, are characteristic of cholesteatomas. Restricted diffusion is a key feature of cholesteatomas, as they contain keratin debris and desquamated epithelial cells, which lead to high cellularity and restricted water diffusion. This feature helps differentiate cholesteatomas from other potential diagnoses, such as fluid collections or granulation tissue, which typically do not show restricted diffusion.",A,False,B,True,"[{""page_content"": ""bony involvement.

9121,201667,A baby boy with Down syndrome born at term develops persistent vomiting within a few hours of his birth. He undergoes an abdominal x-ray which shows a dilated and gas-filled stomach as well as air in the duodenal bulb but a total absence of gas in the small or large bowel. What is the most likely diagnosis?,SBA: Paediatrics,Duodenal atresia,Pyloric stenosis,Gastro-oesophageal reflux,Biliary atresia,Annular pancreas,A,91%,1%,0%,2%,6%,"Explanation:
Duodenal atresia
This should be considered as a diagnosis in any young baby with upper GI symptoms. The x-ray will show no gas in the distal bowel but, counterintuitively, there is often aerobilia if the Sphincter of Oddi is proximal to the atrophic part. When there is air in both the stomach and proximal duodenum on an x-ray it is referred to as the double-bubble sign. There is a reasonably strong association with Down syndrome: around a quarter of cases of duodenal atresia will have Down syndrome.
  Annular pancreas
When the head and uncinate process of the pancreas (ventral pancreas) fail to migrate satisfactorily during embryological development they can fuse with the rest of the pancreas and encircle the duodenum. Around half of patients are diagnosed in childhood although the condition can remain asymptomatic and be picked up incidentally. In the neonatal period symptoms fit with duodenal obstruction and the classic âdouble bubbleâ can be seen on fluoroscopy where contrast media can flow through the pylorus into the D1 segment of the duodenum but no further. Most cases are associated with other congenital abnormalities such as trache-oesophageal fistula, malrotation or atresia of the duodenum or oesophagus, and Down syndrome (i.e. single palmar crease, Brushfield spots) is also an associated syndrome. An annular pancreas is likely to present slightly later than duodenal atresia and often there are traces of gas seen distally, unlike for duodenal atresia.
  Pyloric stenosis
This tends to present within a few weeks of birth with projectile non-bilious vomiting. The hypertrophied pylorus can often be felt as an olive-shaped mass on abdominal palpation and its appearance on imaging gives rise to numerous different signs (Caterpillar sign, shoulder sign, beak sign, diamond sign, double track sign, mushroom sign and string sign). Of these, the string sign (a narrow track of barium passing through a long pyloric canal) is said to be the most specific. Importantly, a normal abdominal radiograph does not exclude the diagnosis. Ultrasound is the most useful test to perform and the main differential diagnosis on clinical grounds is of reflux.
Pyloric stenosis (approximate numbers)
Pyloric length
>15mm
Pyloric thickness
3mm (one side)
7mm (both sides + the middle)
Pyloric volume
1.4cm3
  Biliary atresia
This presents between two weeks and two months of life as an obstructive jaundice picture (i.e. conjugated hyperbilirubinaemia). The extrahepatic bile ducts have become fibrosed and cause obstruction. Initial investigation is usually with ultrasound and an echogenic âtriangular cordâ structure in the porta hepatitis is considered pathognomic. The gallbladder may be normal, small or non-visualised and therefore contributes little to the diagnosis. Further investigation is often with a HIDA scan. If there normal activity within the liver (usually after only a few minutes) but there is no visualisation of tracer within the bowel after 24 hours this is considered diagnostic. Phenobarbitol can be given in the days leading up to the scan to increase biliary output.
  Reflux
This is a common problem which should be diagnosed clinically.",False,"Pyloric stenosis is the most likely diagnosis because the abdominal X-ray showed a dilated and gas-filled stomach, air in the duodenal bulb, and a total absence of gas in the small or large bowel. Pyloric stenosis is a condition in which the pylorus, the opening between the stomach and small intestine, is narrowed, which prevents stomach contents from passing into the small intestine. This can cause persistent vomiting and can be confirmed with an abdominal X-ray.",2,,B,True,"I chose option 1, Duodenal atresia, because the clinical presentation and the x-ray findings are consistent with this diagnosis. 

In a baby with Down syndrome, the risk of gastrointestinal malformations such as duodenal atresia is increased. Duodenal atresia is a congenital condition in which there is a complete or partial obstruction of the duodenum due to the absence or incomplete development of a portion of the duodenum. This leads to the inability of stomach contents to pass through the duodenum and into the rest of the small intestine.

The clinical presentation of persistent vomiting within a few hours of birth is also consistent with duodenal atresia, as the obstruction prevents the passage of gastric contents, leading to vomiting.

The abdominal x-ray findings of a dilated and gas-filled stomach, air in the duodenal bulb, but a total absence of gas in the small or large bowel are classic signs of duodenal atresia.

Acute infarctions are seen as bright areas on DWI with a corresponding low signal area on the ADC map, however in the 7-15 days following a stroke there is first pseudonormalisation and then reversal of the ADC signal. This occurs as cerebral necrosis and the increased water content of the affected tissue gives rise to t2 shine through effect. The medial posterior temporal lobe is a slightly clumsily worded anatomical location. Largely speaking if the brain tissue is adjacent to the falx it is NOT supplied by the MCA.",False,"The MRI scan findings suggest that the patient has suffered an acute PCA infarct (high DWI and low ADC signal in the fronto-parietal lobe) and an old MCA infarct (high DWI and high ADC signal in the medial posterior temporal lobe). The PCA (posterior cerebral artery) is responsible for supplying blood to the occipital and parietal lobes, while the MCA (middle cerebral artery) supplies blood to the temporal lobe. Therefore, the combination of an acute PCA infarct and an old MCA infarct best explains the MRI scan findings.",2,"3. A question about differential diagnoses.

This question would fall under category 2: A question about clinical judgement, what is the correct diagnosis?",E,False,"I chose option 3 (Acute PCA infarct and old MCA infarct) because the MRI findings described in the question are consistent with a combination of an acute infarct and an old infarct in different areas of the brain.

High DWI (Diffusion Weighted Imaging) signal and low ADC (Apparent Diffusion Coefficient) are indicative of an acute infarct, as they represent restricted diffusion due to cytotoxic edema in the affected area. In this case, the acute infarct is located in the fronto-parietal lobe, which is supplied by the posterior cerebral artery (PCA).

On the other hand, high DWI and high ADC signal in the medial posterior temporal lobe suggest an old infarct, as the increased ADC reflects the chronic stage of the infarct where there is less restricted diffusion due to the resolution of cytotoxic edema and the development of gliosis. The medial posterior temporal lobe is supplied by the middle cerebral artery (MCA).

11666,201667,A 17-year-old girl is being investigated for primary amenorrhoea. On examination she has normal secondary sexual characteristics. An HSG shows there to be a blind ended vagina and she goes on to have an MRI scan. This shows complete aplasia of the uterus but the fallopian tubes and ovaries are well demonstrated. What is the most likely diagnosis?,SBA: Paediatrics,Mayer-Rokitansky-Kuster-Hauser (MRKH) syndrome,Diethylstilbestrol exposure in utero,Premature ovarian failure,Turner syndrome,Mullerian duct agenesis,A,80%,3%,0%,2%,15%,"Explanation:
Mullerian duct anomalies (MDA)
The two Mullerian ducts form separately then fuse in the first trimester to form all the structures between the upper vagina and the fallopian tubes. The final part of the amalgamation of the two sides is resorption of the central uterine septum.  There are various classification systems the scope of which is subspecialist. The following is provided for a gross overview only. Different anomalies occur depending on when during development the disruption to normality occurred.
      Aplasia/hypoplasia anomalies
Class I â Agenesis or hypoplasia:
 Agenesis - congenital absence of parts of the mullerian duct; vaginal, cervical, fundal or tubal.
Mayer-Rokitansky-Kuster-Hauser (MRKH) syndrome is an extreme subtype where there is complete aplasia of the upper third of the vagina and uterus. The fallopian tubes and ovaries will be seen normally. Primary amenorrhoea is the usual presentation. 
Class II â Unicornuate: Banana like configuration of the remaining horn
Fusion anomalies
Class III - Didelphys: Non-fusion, two separate uterine horns, two separate cervices. All of the walls contain all of the layers of the normal uterus. The uterine cavities do not communicate with one another owing to the presence of a vaginal septum.
Class IV â Bicornuate: partial fusion, the septum separating the two horns consists of myometrium. There can be either one or two cervices depending on the degree of fusion but crucially the two uterine cavities do communicate with one another. Sometimes the appearance of a bicornuate uterus is referred to as âheart-shapedâ.
Reabsorption (of uterine septum) anomalies
Class V â Septate: partial fusion, a fibrous remnant septum remains. This is the most common anomaly presenting as infertility.
Class VI â Arcuate: a mild form of septate uterus but which is not associated with subfertility.
The crucial diagnosis to make is that of a septate uterus. Patients with a septate uterus can present with recurrent mid-term miscarriages due to implantation on the suboptimally vascularised septum. Surgical resection of this septum can significantly improve fertility chances. Distinguishing between didelphys and bicollis bicornuate uteri can be very challenging and is beyond the scope of this text.
There is no association with abnormalities of the external genitalia or ovaries since these derive from different embryological components but renal anomalies (agenesis, ectopia, fusion) can be found in around a third of patients and should be actively sought. Infertility is the primary clinical consequence of an MDA.
  Hysterosalpingogram (HSG)
HSGs are performed in the setting of infertility to confirm or refute tubal patency. It is not the ideal modality to diagnose MDAs since it provides information only on the internal contours of any patent cavities. Historically the intercornual angle was used to differentiate between a septate uterus (<75o) and a bicornuate or didelphys uterus (>105o) but this is no longer considered reliable. In addition an HSG will overlook obstructed hemisystems or functional remnants which do not communicate with the vagina.
  Ultrasound
Differentiating between fusion anomalies (bicornuate and didelphys) and reabsorption anomalies (septate and arcuate) depends on the fundal contour. Usually this can be well seen on ultrasound. Where there has been a failure of complete fusion a fundal cleft remains. This should be at least 1cm deep.  If the patient has a septate or arcuate uterus then fusion is complete so the fundus will be domed as is normal. A normal dome is greater than 5mm high.
  MRI
MRI is considered the gold standard for evaluating cases of MDA. The presence of menstrual blood products within an obstructed hemi uterus is, where present, readily seen as high signal on T1. Where a patient has two cervices these can be seen appearing like two âowl eyesâ when imaged axially to the vagina.
  Diethylstilbestrol (DES) exposure
DES was an artificial oestrogen used to treat women suffering from recurrent miscarriages. Owing to an association with clear cell carcinoma of the vagina and cervix its use was halted in the 1970s. It also caused shortening of the upper segment of the uterus which gave rise to a very characteristic T-shaped uterine cavity as seen on HSG. This was classed as a Class VII type of MDA.
Pertinent points:
Renal agenesis, ectopia and fusion present in 33% of patients
Aplastic uterus + normal fallopian tubes and ovaries = MRKH syndrome
Widely divergent horns + fundal cleft = fusion anomaly (didelphys or bicornuate)
Two cervices also known as owl eyes on MRI = either didelphys or bicollis bicornuate (difficult to tell them apart)
No communication between two uterine horns = didelphys
Domed fundus = reabsorption anomaly (Septate or arcuate)
Recurrent midterm miscarriages can be due to septate uterus and can be surgically resected to improve fertility.",True,I chose 3. Mayer-Rokitansky-Kuster-Hauser (MRKH) syndrome because it is the most likely diagnosis for a 17-year-old girl with primary amenorrhoea and normal secondary sexual characteristics who has a blind-ended vagina and an MRI scan that shows complete aplasia of the uterus but normal fallopian tubes and ovaries. MRKH Syndrome is a congenital condition that affects the reproductive system and is characterized by the absence of the uterus and the upper part of the vagina. It is usually diagnosed during adolescence and is the most common cause of primary amenorrhoea in young women.,2,,A,True,"I chose Mayer-Rokitansky-Kuster-Hauser (MRKH) syndrome as the most likely diagnosis because the clinical findings and imaging results align with the typical features of this condition. MRKH syndrome is characterized by primary amenorrhoea, normal secondary sexual characteristics, and congenital absence of the uterus and the upper two-thirds of the vagina. The presence of normal fallopian tubes and ovaries, as well as the aplasia of the uterus, further supports this diagnosis. 

The other options are less likely due to the following reasons:

2. Diethylstilbestrol exposure in utero: This can cause various reproductive tract abnormalities, but it typically does not result in complete uterine aplasia.
 
3. Premature ovarian failure: This condition is associated with early menopause and decreased ovarian function, but it does not involve uterine aplasia.

4. Turner syndrome: This genetic disorder affects females and can cause primary amenorrhoea, but it is also associated with other features such as short stature and webbed neck, which were not mentioned in the case.

5.

11796,201667,A baby is born by elective caesarean section for known congenital cardiac disease. The aorta and pulmonary trunk both arise from the right ventricle. There is a VSD. The baby has rockerbottom feet and overlapping fingers. What is the nature of the cardiac condition?,SBA: Paediatrics,Double outlet right ventricle,Tetralogy of Fallot,Transposition of the great vessels,Congenitally corrected transposition of the great vessels,Truncus arteriorsus,A,67%,7%,4%,2%,20%,"Explanation:
Double outlet right ventricle
DORV is one of the five Ts of cyanotic and plethoric congenital heart disease (Tingle - i.e. Single - ventricle. The others are Tricuspid atresia, Transposition of the great vessels, TAPVC, truncus arteriosus). As the name suggests, both great vessels (the aorta and pulmonary artery) arise from the right ventricle. Consequently it is logical that 100% of cases have a VSD to facilitate drainage of the left ventricle. If the pulmonary trunk is stenotic, as is usually the case, then the lungs will be oligaemic on a CXR. Conversely in the absence of pulmonary stenosis there will be plethora - this accounts for roughly 25% of cases but yet earns DORV its place in the 5Ts. The crux of the imaging findings, and the phrase to look out for in an exam question setting is that there is no continuity between the mitral valve and the adjacent semilunar valve. This finding is pathognomonic of DORV.
Both Edwards (trisomy 18) and Patau (trisomy 13) syndrome patients can exhibit rockerbottom feet and overlapping fingers although the findings are more closely linked with the former. DORV is associated with both trisomys.
  Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF)
TOF (not to be confused with trache-oesophageal fistula) causes cyanosis but without pulmonary plethora thus is not included in the 5 Ts.
The tetrat consists of:
VSD
Overriding aorta
Right ventricular hypertrophy (RVH)
RV outflow obstruction (hence pulmonary oligaemia)
TOF is the most common cyanotic congenital heart disease presenting after 12 months of age. In ambulant children the classic finding is of squatting whereby the child squats following exertion in order to increase blood flow to the lungs. It usually presents by at least 3-4months of age however, but at birth the condition can be concealed by shunting of blood through a patent ductus arteriosus (PDA). Another facet to the clinical presentation can be polycythaemia which takes place due to chronic low oxygen levels.
Owing to the RVH the cardiac apex is turned upwards contributing to an appearance referred to as âboot shapedâ to the cardiac shadow on a CXR.
There is a strong association with right sided aortic arch. Nearly all right sided arches are associated with some form of congenital heart disease and most of these are TOF. Conversely 25% of TOF patients also have a right sided aortic arch.
  Transposition of the Great Vessels (TGA)
TGA is one of the five Ts of cyanotic and plethoric congenital heart disease (The others are Tricuspid atresia, Tingle [ie single] ventricle, TAPVC, truncus arteriosus). Broadly speaking this presents either at birth (it is the most common cyanotic heart disease diagnosed in the first 24 hours of life), or at approximately two weeks of age. Two possible theorised reasons for the later presentation are the closure of the PDA and declining foetal haemoglobin levels leading to decompensation. When the great vessels are transposed there exists two independent circulations. This is therefore only compatible with life if a shunt mechanism also exists, such as an ASD, VSD or PDA. The CXR can be initially normal but develops an âegg on sideâ appearance to the cardiac shadow. In some cases the transposition is âcorrectedâ where the ventricles are also switched such that the correct ventricle feeds the correct great vessel although the left and right sided circulations remain separate. In corrected transposition the CXR features of note are an apparently absent pulmonary trunk, and an abnormal aortic contour.
  Truncus arteriosus
Embryologically the great vessels begin as one 'conotruncus' which separates during development. When this separation process fails, the baby is left with a single outlet called a truncus arteriosus. On a CXR the baby will be plethoric with cardiomegaly and there are a number of associations which help point towards the answer in an exam question without the aid of an echocardiogram. Forked ribs, DiGeorge syndrome, a right sided arch, or an interrupted arch are all known associations.",False,"Tetralogy of Fallot is the most likely diagnosis in this case, as it is the only cardiac condition that includes all the clinical features mentioned in the question: a VSD, rockerbottom feet, and overlapping fingers. It is also the most common congenital cardiac condition that affects the right ventricle.",2,,B,True,"I chose option 5, Double Outlet Right Ventricle (DORV), because the description of the cardiac condition in the question aligns with the features of DORV. In this congenital heart defect, both the aorta and the pulmonary trunk arise from the right ventricle, instead of the aorta arising from the left ventricle and the pulmonary trunk arising from the right ventricle, as in a normal heart. Additionally, the presence of a Ventricular Septal Defect (VSD) is a common feature in DORV, allowing blood to mix between the two ventricles.

14246,201667,You are reviewing the radiographs of a 30-year-old marathon runner who has been experiencing worsening hip pains over the last few months. There is a roundness to the superior aspect of the left femoral neck and you suspect he has cam-type femoroacetabular impingement. Which of the following is most likely to be seen with this abnormality? Select ONE answer only.,SBA: Musculoskeletal and Trauma,Femoral retroversion,Acetabular retrotorsion,Femoral anteversion,Acetabular retroversion,Acetabular anteversion,A,49%,3%,20%,19%,9%,"Explanation:
Femoroacetabular impingement (FAI)
Mixed type - >80% of patients have components of both cam-type and pincer-type FAI.
Cam type - a cam is an engineering term for an oval/egg shaped component with a hole through the middle of the wider end. In cam type FAI the femoral head takes on a 'cam' shaped appearance due to bony overgrowth at the superior aspect of the femoral neck. This abnormal bony contour impinges against the anterosuperior aspect of the acetabulum during movement. The condition occurs more frequently in men and tends to affect men in their 30s. Certain conditions can predispose to cam-type FAI, including SUFE, DDH and Perthes disease. Some patients with cam-type FAI exhibit femoral retroversion.
Pincer type - here bony protuberance of the anterosuperior acetabulum causes over-coverage of the femoral head and impingement against the femoral neck. Protrusio acetabuli predisposes to pincer-type FAI. The relationship of the overgrown anterior acetabular rim to the posterior acetabular rim in pincer-type FAI is called acetabular retroversion since it causes the femoral neck to twist posteriorly. Patients usually stand with their toes pointing outwards as a consequence. The condition is more common in women and a patient is typically aged around 40.",False,"Acetabular anteversion is the most likely abnormality to be seen with cam-type femoroacetabular impingement. This abnormality occurs when the acetabular socket is angled more anteriorly than normal, causing the femoral head to be directed more medially than normal. This can cause the femoral neck to have a rounder superior aspect, which is what is seen in the radiographs of the marathon runner.",2,"3. A question about clinical reasoning, what is the best approach to managing the patient?

This question would fall under option 2: A question about clinical judgement, what is the correct diagnosis?",A,False,"I chose option 3, acetabular retroversion, because it is most commonly associated with cam-type femoroacetabular impingement (FAI). 

Cam-type FAI occurs when there is an abnormal shape of the femoral head-neck junction, which is the roundness you observed in the radiograph. This abnormal shape can cause the femoral head to impinge on the acetabulum (hip socket) during certain hip movements, leading to hip pain and potential damage to the joint.

Acetabular retroversion is a condition where the acetabulum (hip socket) is oriented more posteriorly than normal. This can lead to a reduced range of motion and increased contact between the femoral head and acetabulum, contributing to the development of cam-type FAI. 

The other options (acetabular retrotorsion, femoral anteversion, acetabular anteversion, and femoral retroversion) are not as strongly associated with cam-type FAI as acetabular retroversion is.",D,True,A,False,"[{""page_content"": ""\u30b9\u30ad\u30e3\u30f3\u3057\u305f\uff3fADH_2020\nfemoroacetabular Impingement (FAI): This is a syndrome of painful hip movement. \nIt's based on hip/ femoral deformities, and honestly might be total BS.

9946,201667,A 50- year-old man experiences his first ever seizure and suffers a posterior dislocation of the shoulder. He visits his local A+E department where the joint is imaged. Which of the following is LEAST likely to be found?,SBA: Musculoskeletal and Trauma,Indentation of the posterior humeral head (a Hill-Sachs lesion),Lightbulb sign,Reverse Bankart lesion,Reverse Hill-Sachs lesion,Avulsion of the lesser tuberosity,A,88%,3%,2%,3%,4%,"Explanation:
Anterior dislocation (95%)
The integrity of the shoulder joint is weakest when at extreme abduction and external rotation.
When the humeral head dislocates anteriorly with respect to the glenoid, the posterolateral aspect of the humeral head impacts on the inferior glenoid and both can suffer. The damage to the humeral head is known as a Hill-Sachs lesion and the inferior glenoid fracture is called a Bankart lesion.
  Posterior dislocation (5%)
At extreme abduction with internal rotation the humeral head is forced posteriorly and can dislocate. The usual scenario is in the context of a seizure or alternatively when a patient has been electrocuted. The AP x-ray can seem normal to the untrained eye. If the humerus remains internally rotated, the greater tuberosity rotates to a more anterior position and its characteristic outline is lost leading to the so-called âlight-bulbâ sign of a posterior dislocation. To establish the relationship between the humeral head and the glenoid, a Y-view, where the glenoid is viewed head-on, is often performed but an axillary view, where the beam travels through the axilla, is said to be even more useful. Avulsion fractures of the lesser tuberosity (where the subscapularis muscle attaches) are commonly seen in association with posterior dislocations.
A bony defect on the anteromedial surface of the humeral head is known as reverse Hill-Sachs lesion. Similarly a tear to the posterior glenoid labrum is called a reverse Bankart lesion.
  Inferior dislocation (<1%) â Also known as Luxatio erecta
The patient presents with their arm held over their head. X-rays will show the humeral head displaced downwards and caught underneath the glenoid.",False,I chose 4. Reverse Hill-Sachs lesion because it is the least likely to be found in a 50-year-old man experiencing his first ever seizure and suffering a posterior dislocation of the shoulder.

Select ONE answer only.",SBA: Paediatrics,Duplication cyst,Normal thymus,Lymphoma,Germ Cell Tumour,Askin Tumour,A,82%,11%,4%,2%,1%,"Explanation:
Duplication cyst
These are very rarely found in the anterior mediastinum, usually being posterior mediastinal (neuroenteric) or middle mediastinal (bronchogenic, enteric).
  Lymphoma
This is the most common anterior mediastinal mass in children. It may be difficult to differentiate a lymphoma from normal thymus, particularly in a patient younger than 10 years of age. Associated lymphadenopathy (i.e. cervical) can be the key to distinguishing the two pathologies. Calcification is rare prior to any treatment but can be a feature of lymphoma which has been treated.
  Germ Cell Tumour
This often causes a large anterior mediastinal mass. It can be subdivided into Teratoma (usually cystic with fat and calcification), seminoma (bulky and lobulated) and Non-seminomatous Germ Cell Tumour (haemorrhage and necrosis).
  Askin Tumour
These heterogenous tumours are part of the Ewing Sarcoma spectrum. Patients are often in their early teens. Askin tumours displace rather than invade adjacent mediastinal structures although rib destruction is common and is a fact which can help distinguish it from a pleuropulmonary blastoma which is another cause of a large mediastinal mass, albeit usually found in babies under the age of 2, but which does not cause rib destruction.",False,"Lymphoma is the most likely diagnosis for a large middle mediastinal mass with a smooth outline, measuring 9 HU and containing no calcification, fat or haemorrhage. Lymphoma is a type of cancer that originates from lymphocytes, which are a type of white blood cell. It is the most common type of cancer in children, with the most common presentation being a large mass in the chest.",2,,B,False,"I chose option 3, Germ Cell Tumour, as the most likely diagnosis based on the given information. The patient is a 12-year-old boy with a large middle mediastinal mass, which is a common location for germ cell tumors. The mass has a smooth outline and no invasion of adjacent structures, which is also consistent with this diagnosis. Additionally, the mass measures 9 HU (Hounsfield units) on the CT scan, which suggests a low-density mass, and this is typical for germ cell tumors, especially those with a cystic component. The absence of calcification, fat, or hemorrhage further supports this diagnosis. 

The other options are less likely based on the provided information:
1. Normal thymus - A large mass in a 12-year-old is less likely to be a normal thymus.
2. Lymphoma - While it can present as a mediastinal mass, lymphomas typically have higher attenuation values (greater than 20 HU) on CT scans.
4. Askin Tumor - These tumors are rare and usually present with an aggressive behavior and invasion of adjacent structures, which is not described in this case.

Umbilical venous lines are used for antibiotic, fluid, TPN and transfusion delivery and obviate the need for multiple cannulation attempts however correct placement is important as the consequences of malplacement can be serious.
Malplaced lines within the heart can cause serious cardiac complications and those within the liver can lead to hepatic complications. Although deliberately not specified well in the question, deviation towards the right (within the appropriate area for the liver on an x-ray) suggests location within the right hepatic or right portal veins.
The UAC courses inferiorly into the pelvis as it traverses the internal iliac artery, before rising through the common iliac artery and thence to the aorta.
The UVC rises up into the abdomen and the tip should run through the ductus venosus to join with the inferior vena cava and be sited within the inferior vena cava at approximately the level of the diaphragm. Misplaced lines usually lie within either the portal vein or hepatic vein.

14151,201667,You are reviewing the MRI scan of a 76-year-old man under active surveillance for a Gleason 3+3 focus of adenocarcinoma of the prostate discovered incidentally a year ago. By which scoring system are such prostate cancers evaluated on follow-up imaging? Select ONE answer only.,"SBA: Genito urinary, Adrenal, Obstetrics & Gynaecology and Breast",PRECISE,PI-RADS1,PI-RADS2,RECIST,PERCIST,A,25%,7%,46%,12%,10%,"Explanation:
PRECISE (PC Radiological Estimation of Change in Sequential Evaluation)
The PRECISE guidelines have been proposed as a scoring system for evaluating the follow-up scans when patients are on 'active surveillance' management for their prostate cancer (Moore, et al. Eur Urol. 2017;71(4):648-655).
  1 - Resolution of previous features suspicious on MRI
2 - Reduction in volume and/or conspicuity of previous features suspicious on MRI
3 - Stable MRI appearance: no new focal/diffuse lesions
4 - Significant increase in size and/or conspicuity of features suspicious for prostate cancer
5 - Definitive radiologic stage progression
  PI-RADS (Prostate imaging reporting and data system)
This scoring system (now on its second version) has been introduced to streamline prostate cancer reporting and improve inter-operator variability. The scoring system differs slightly between the transitional zone and the peripheral zone but overall, using a combination of the T2, DWI/ADC and dynamic contrast enhancement lesions are graded 1-5 depending on the likelihood of malignancy.
  PERCIST (Positron emission response criteria in solid tumours)
This is a scoring system used for PET/CT imaging to follow up lesions and determine progression. Below is a simplified summary of the different possible outcomes.
Complete metabolic response (CMR) - resolution of target lesions with no new lesions developing
Partial metabolic response (PMR) - 30% reduction in SUV (corrected for lean body mass) in the target lesions
Stable metabolic disease (SMD) - neither CMR, PMR nor PMD
Progressive metabolic disease (PMD) - >30% increase in SUV (corrected for lean body mass) or new lesions
  RECIST (Response evaluation criteria in solid tumours)
To better develop inter-operator agreement in cancer follow-up imaging the RECIST criteria were developed.
Target lesions are identified on the index staging scan and these lesions are evaluated on subsequent scans against size standards to determine whether there has been overall response to treatment or disease progression. Below is a simplified version of the different possible outcomes.
Disease response
Complete - disappearance of all target lesions
Partial - >30% decrease in the sum of the longest axes of all of the target lesions
Stable disease - grey area between partial response and disease progression
Disease progression - >20% increase in the sum of the longest axes of all of the target lesions",False,"I chose PI-RADS2 because it is the Prostate Imaging-Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) version 2 that is used to evaluate prostate cancers on follow-up imaging.

Disseminated pneumocystis causes cortical necrosis and calcification, similar to disseminated MAI. The other conditions are associated with medullary nephrocalcinosis. Incidentally, medullary nephrocalcinosis is 20 times more common than cortical nephrocalcinosis.
The most common cause of nephrocalcinosis is hyperparathyroidism (followed closely by renal tubular acidosis). Ehlers-Danlos syndrome and Beckwith-Weidman (as well as Caroli disease) are associated with medullary sponge kidney (which should always be considered if there is unilateral medullary nephrocalcinosis.

Sarcoidosis  ",False,"Hyperparathyroidism is a recognized cause of cortical nephrocalcinosis. This condition is caused by an overproduction of parathyroid hormone, which can lead to an increase in calcium levels in the blood and deposition of calcium in the renal cortex. This deposition of calcium in the renal cortex can cause renal pyramids to appear hyperechoic with posterior acoustic shadowing on ultrasound, which is suggestive of cortical nephrocalcinosis.",2,"3.

Cardiac CT is susceptible to artefact in multiple forms.
Step artefact is caused by misregistration of anatomical landmarks and is worsened by an irregular heart rhythm or large field of view coupled with a short detector row.
Motion artefact can be caused by breathing, a fast or irregular heart rate. The right coronary artery is usually worst affected by motion artefact. âPaddingâ around the optimal imaging phase can help to reduce motion artefact.
Streak artefact can be caused by metallic artefacts, severe calcification within the coronary arteries and also a high density of contrast within the SVC or right atrium.",True,"I chose number 5 because irregular heart rhythm is one of the most common causes of motion artefact in cardiac CT.

The question is asking how is best to locate a suspected ectopic parathyroid adenoma. The traditional answer used to be a Sestamibi scan (Tc99m MIBI).

The available evidence currently suggests that PET/CT be used as an adjunct to traditional localisation methods where results from those have proven inconclusive.

This question is to do with the imaging characteristics of blood within the brain. We can think of the intracranial space as a closed box as far as oxygen tensions go which means that blood degrades in a predictable fashion and therefore has predictable appearances on T1 and T2 according to the changes in the haemoglobin molecule. There are a few different methods to help remember the changes in appearance, one of which is the table below:

  The important distinction is around the subacute stages. In that case, by and large, if it is bright on T1 it is subacute and T2 then decides if it is early or late subacute. The timeframes given are also important and can form the basis of 2a exam questions.
  As far as the involvement of CT goes, hyperacute and acute haemorrhage is dense compared to the brain parenchyma but there window of time as the blood breaks down when the haemorrhage becomes isointense to the brain parenchyma and can very easily be missed. This corresponds to the subacute stages. Thereafter the haematoma becomes more serous and therefore darker on CT and once again visible next to the brain parenchyma.",True,"I chose this answer because a subdural haematoma is typically hyperintense on T1-weighted MRI images and hypointense on T2-weighted MRI images. This is due to the presence of methemoglobin in the haemorrhage, which is hyperintense on T1-weighted images and hypointense on T2-weighted images.",1,"3.

This question falls under category 1: Basic factual recall, either of basic science, physics, anatomy or regarding a procedure.",A,False,"I chose option 3 (T1 = isointense, T2 = hypointense) because it best represents the MRI features of a subdural hematoma that appears isodense to the brain parenchyma on CT. 

An isodense subdural hematoma typically occurs in the subacute stage, which is around 3-7 days after the injury. At this stage, the hematoma has a similar density to the surrounding brain tissue on a CT scan, making it difficult to detect. 

On MRI, the subacute subdural hematoma would appear isointense on T1-weighted images, meaning it has a similar signal intensity to the brain parenchyma. On T2-weighted images, it would appear hypointense, or darker than the surrounding brain tissue. This combination of MRI features (T1 = isointense, T2 = hypointense) helps to differentiate the subdural hematoma from normal brain tissue and other types of hemorrhages, allowing the radiologist to detect the hematoma despite its isodense appearance on CT.",C,True,A,False,"[{""page_content"": ""performed on the very elderly (Fig. 56.39).\nOn CT chronic subdural haematomas appear to be of lower density \nthan the brain but may contain areas of high density, or even fluid \nlevels, due to more recent haemorrhage.

9306,201667,A 28-year-old man undergoing chemotherapy prior to having a bone marrow transplant for his leukaemia presents with abdominal pain and bloody diarrhoea. You are reporting his CT scan which shows oedema and transmural necrosis affecting the caecum. Which of the following is the most likely explanation for these findings?,SBA: Gastrointestinal,Typhlitis,Crohn disease,Tuberculosis,Radiation colitis,Infective colitis,A,88%,1%,1%,6%,3%,"Explanation:
Neutropenic colitis also known as typhlitis
The name typhlitis comes from the greek typhlos meaning blind ending sac and relates to the involvement of the caecum. Although the rest of the bowel can be affected it is the caecum which bears the brunt of this disease. The caecal wall becomes thickened (to >4mm) and markedly oedematous; the appearance may be so extreme that it may seem more like a large fluid density mass than part of the bowel.  Barium studies carry a significant risk of perforation and should be avoided but would show oedema and severe ulceration. On CT transmural oedema with adjacent fat stranding is found. It develops in immunocompromised patients, in particular those undergoing induction chemotherapy prior to bone marrow transplantation.
  Radiation enteritis
Acutely following radiation therapy there is cell death of the rapidly turning over mucosal cells of the bowel wall, and particularly of the terminal ileum. This leads to ulceration and mucosal/submucosal oedema.
Subacutely to chronically the radiation damage leads to endarteritis obliterans and chronic mesenteric ischaemia. The bowel does heal but fibrous changes persist and strictures can form. There is no link in severity between the acute and chronic forms; the presence or absence of the one does not predict the other.
The bowel loops can be seen to be fixed in the same positions on sequential contrast studies by a desmoplastic response within the mesentery. Patients complain of crampy abdominal pain from intermittent obstruction as well as diarrhoea.
  Tuberculosis
Abdominal tuberculosis most commonly affects the ileocaecal junction with thickening of the ileocaecal valve and narrowing of the terminal ileum. This can be seen on fluoroscopic examination as the Fleischner sign or umbrella sign where the gaping ileocaecal valve abuts the thin, strictured terminal ileum. Local lymph node enlargement with or without central low attenuation to the lymph nodes may be seen on CT. Multiple different lesions in multiple sites (i.e. skip lesions) is also a feature and a characteristic feature is of elevation of the margins of an ulcer which follow the orientation of lymphoid follicles. In the colon this means the margins are elevated in the transverse plane but in the terminal ileum they are longitudinal. 
The involvement of the ileocaecal valve and the presence of skip lesions means that a key differential diagnosis is Crohn disease. Over half of cases of abdominal tuberculosis will have concurrent ascites whereas this is a relatively rare feature for Crohn disease and can be used as a discriminator.
Specifically relating to the stomach, tuberculosis can cause pyloric stenosis, multiple deep ulcers on the lesser curve, and linitis plastic type narrowing of the antrum.
  Crohn disease
Crohn disease is characterised by discontinuous (skip lesions) transmural non-caseating granulomatous inflammation. By contrast, ulcerative colitis is characterised by continuous mucosal inflammation. Crohn disease is usually diagnosed in adolescence or young adulthood and patients present with non-specific abdominal pains, diarrhoea, weight loss and anaemia. Crohn disease can affect any part of the entire length of the gastrointestinal tract, in contrast to ulcerative colitis which affects only the colon, but owing to the high concentration of lymphoid tissue in the terminal ileum the vast majority of patients will have terminal ileal involvement, in particular thickening of the iliocaecal valve. Aphthous ulceration is common and on endoscopy a cobblestone appearance to the mucosa can be seen where the thickened and oedematous wall is broken up by deep longitudinal fissures. Deep ârosethornâ ulcers can be seen on fluoroscopic studies.  Strictures and fistulae characterise the chronic sequela of this disease.
Conditions associated with Crohn disease
Erythema nodosum
Gallstones
Oxalate ureteric calculi
Sclerosing cholangitis
Cholangiocarcinoma
Small bowel carcinoma
  Infective colitis
Infective colitis causes oedematous mural thickening and mural enhancement with the different underlying organism affecting slightly different segments of bowel (albeit with much overlap). Pericolic fat stranding and ascites are variably seen.

14189,201667,You are reporting a CT scan of an adult patient There is a low density mass in the tail of the pancreas measuring around 5cm in diameter. You suspect she has a mucinous cystadenoma. Which of the following is consistent with this diagnosis? Select ONE answer only.,SBA: Gastrointestinal,Patient aged around 45 years,Low CEA level,High amylase level,Location in the head of the pancreas,Innumerable small cysts,A,84%,3%,4%,3%,6%,"Explanation:
Amylase
The presence of any amylase in a pancreatic mass aspirates suggests communication with the pancreatic ductal system. In theory this would help identify an IPMN and a pseudocyst however it has poor sensitivity and specificity for doing so.
CEA levels
Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) is a tumour marker associated with pancreatic adenocarcinomas (as well as colorectal adenocarcinoma and others). Mucinous cystadenomas invariably degenerate to cystadenocarcinomas and as such can often exhibit elevated CEA levels too. It is unusual for a serous cystadenoma to exhibit elevated CEA levels.
Mucinous cystadenoma
Mucinous cystadenomas of the pancreas are subject to a similar adenoma-carcinoma sequence to colonic adenomas. Left long enough, all transform into mucinous cystadenocarcinomas which have a reasonably poor prognosis. Classically patients are middle-aged women (mean age 47years). They are also cystic tumours but whose cysts are larger than for serous cystadenomas i.e. >20mm. They have a predilection for the pancreatic tail.
Serous cystadenoma
These are largely benign tumours which classically occur in elderly ladies in their 70s. They have a sponge like appearance where innumerable small (<20mm) cysts sit around a characteristic central scar. The tumours can be very large, and may even present as a palpable mass, but usually are around 5cm in total diameter. Although they can be found in any part of the pancreas, there is a slight predisposition for the head of the pancreas. There is usually a central scar and calcifications can sometimes be seen within the scar.

1. Low CEA level: While CEA levels can be variable, a mucinous cystadenoma may have elevated CEA levels, so a low level would not be consistent with this diagnosis.
2. High amylase level: Mucinous cystadenomas typically do not have high amylase levels, as they are not associated with pancreatic duct obstruction.
4. Location in the head of the pancreas: Mucinous cystadenomas are more commonly found in the body or tail of the pancreas, not the head.

Since the lesion is high in T2 signal, high ADC values may be caused by the T2 shine through effect. Certainly, correlation with the DWI appearances would be needed to draw further conclusions and these have not been provided.
A cholesterol granuloma contains both cholesterol crystals and blood products (hence is bright on T1) whereas a cholesteatoma is isointense to brain parenchyma on T1 and can apparently be seen clinically as a whitish mass behind the tympanic membrane. Clinically a cholesterol granuloma may be described as causing a blue tympanic membrane. The absence of pulsatile tinnitus can help distinguish it from a glomus tympanicum.

  An aberrant internal carotid artery can cause a pulsatile mass in the middle ear. The question usually asked on this topic is slightly different and to do with the persistent stapedial artery and consequential aplastic foramen spinosum (anatomically â âthe heel of the high-heeled shoeâ).

  IPF (Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis) can only be diagnosed in the absence of a precipitating condition such as asbestosis, rheumatoid arthritis, or drug toxicity. Where such exists, the condition is termed UIP (Usual interstitial pneumonia). CFA (Crytpogenic fibrosing alveolitis) is a historic term for the same thing.
There is much overlap in the features of the various different fibrotic lung diseases.
Therefore, look for specific features which are most strongly associated with the different conditions. The table below (despite appearances) simplifies the overall situation significantly and is inadequate for real life radiology but does provide a framework on which to build further understanding of these conditions.
The features in bold are the most prominent in each of the conditions.

Truncus is classically associated with DiGeorge syndrome (Chromosome 22 abnormality characterised by elongated face and cleft palate, also associated with tetralogy of Fallot). Truncus is also associated with the rarer CHARGE syndrome (Coloboma, congenital Heart disease, choanal atresia, retardation, genital hypoplasia, ear abnormalities). It is also strongly associated with a ventricular septal defect, right sided / interrupted arch. Atrial septal defects can occur in association but are far less common than VSDs.",True,"Atrial septal defect is not associated with truncus arteriosus. Truncus arteriosus is a congenital heart defect in which a single vessel, the truncus, arises from the heart and carries both oxygenated and deoxygenated blood to the body. It is often associated with other congenital heart defects, such as ventricular septal defect, right-sided aortic arch, and DiGeorge syndrome. Coloboma is a congenital eye defect that is sometimes associated with truncus arteriosus.",1,This question would fall under category 1: Basic factual recall.,A,False,"I chose option 5, Coloboma, because it is the least associated with truncus arteriosus. Truncus arteriosus is a congenital heart defect where a single blood vessel comes out of the right and left ventricles, instead of the normal two vessels (pulmonary artery and aorta). 

1. DiGeorge syndrome is associated with truncus arteriosus because it is a genetic disorder that affects the development of several body systems, including the heart. Truncus arteriosus is one of the possible heart defects seen in DiGeorge syndrome.
2. Right-sided aortic arch is also associated with truncus arteriosus, as it is a common vascular anomaly that can occur with this congenital heart defect.
3. Atrial septal defect is a defect in the septum between the heart's two upper chambers (atria). It can be associated with truncus arteriosus as a part of the abnormal development of the heart.
4. Ventricular septal defect is a defect in the septum between the heart's two lower chambers (ventricles). It is almost always present in patients with truncus arteriosus, as the single blood vessel arises from both ventricles.

On the other hand, Coloboma (option 5) is a congenital eye abnormality where a part of the eye structure is missing, which is not directly related to truncus arteriosus.

13813,201667,"A 67-year-old woman undergoes a CT scan of her adrenal glands for an incidental lesion picked up on a CT colonogram. The lesion is situated in the lateral limb of the left adrenal gland and is 2cm in diameter. It measures 38HU on the unenhanced sequence, 115HU on the portal venous phase and 75HU on the delayed sequences. You may use a calculator. What is the relative washout of this lesion?","SBA: Genito urinary, Adrenal, Obstetrics & Gynaecology and Breast",35%,52%,67%,49%,48%,A,69%,15%,8%,3%,5%,"Explanation:
Figures have been rounded to the nearest whole number.
Absolute washout = (115-75)/(115-38) = 52%
Relative washout = (115-75)/115 = 35%
    This lesion is non-adenomatous. Given the avid contrast enhancement on the arterial phase (>110HU) a phaeochromocytoma should be strongly suspected.
  Adrenal washout
Washout characteristics of adrenal nodules help confirm or refute a diagnosis of an adrenal adenoma. The absolute washout takes into account the initial uptake of contrast whereas the relative washout calculation is based only on how well contrast washes out of a nodule.
The underpinning principle is that vasculature within malignant lesions is more permeable than in benign lesions. This allows contrast to diffuse out of the lesion during the portal venous phase and the contrast is then slower to wash out during the delayed phase than it would be for benign lesions. Thus the higher/faster washout characteristics (either absolute or relative) the more suggestive it is that a lesion is benign.
    Phaeochromocytomas also known as adrenal paragangliomas.
Paragangliomas are found all over the body and called different things in different places despite the fact that the histology is the same.
    Phaeochromocytomas are known as the 10% tumours. Purportedly 10% are: bilateral, asymmetrical, familial, are extra-adrenal, contain calcification. The most well known syndromic association is with Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia (MEN) type II (both a and b). They do also occur with phakomatoses (von Hippel Lindau, neurofibromatosis type I, Sturge Weber and Tuberous Sclerosis).
The classic but rare presentation is of uncontrollable hypertension due to catecholamine production and the classic giveaway blood test is elevated levels of urinary VMA.
On CT they can have a range of appearances including post-haemorrhagic or necrotic low attenuation, solid and/or cystic areas. They enhance strongly and are slow to washout. On MRI they tend to return low T1 signal (excepting areas of haemorrhage which may be high) but very bright T2 signal giving rise to the lightbulb sign. The main differential diagnosis would be of adrenal cortical carcinoma. Phaeochromocytomas don't invade the IVC and won't cause atrophy of the contralateral adrenal gland, where adrenal cortical carcinomas can.
  MIBG scanning (I123-Metaiodobenzylguanidine)
This comes under the broader heading of a guanethidine analogue and can be used to pinpoint catecholamine producing tumours such as phaeochromocytomas or other paragangliomas. The scan can be used to locate an extra-adrenal phaeochromocytoma. The tracer is also taken up by neuroblastomas, carcinoid tumours and medullary carcinoma of the thyroid.
If the CT scan shows morphologically normal adrenal glands then an MRI scan is unlikely to be of any further benefit. A dedicated MRI scan of the adrenal glands with in and out of phase sequences might be useful in the setting of an indeterminate mass; if there is signal dropout within the mass it is likely to be an adenoma.
An adrenal biopsy should 'never' be performed for a suspected phaeochromocytoma. The risk is of provoking catecholamine release and triggering extreme hypertension or a cardiac arrhythmia.",False,"The relative washout of this lesion can be calculated by subtracting the HU on the unenhanced sequence from the HU on the delayed sequence, and then dividing by the HU on the portal venous phase. In this case, the calculation would be (75 - 38) / 115 = 0.67, or 67%.",1,"3. A question about problem solving, how to calculate the relative washout?",C,False,"I chose this option because the relative washout percentage calculated using the given Hounsfield Units (HU) from the CT scan is closest to option 1 (52%).

The relative washout is a measure used to differentiate between benign and malignant adrenal lesions. It is calculated using the Hounsfield Units (HU) from the unenhanced, portal venous phase, and delayed sequences of the CT scan.

In this case, I used the provided HU measurements and the formula for relative washout:

Relative washout = ((Enhanced HU - Delayed HU) / (Enhanced HU - Unenhanced HU)) x 100

What should you advise next before the patient is taken to theatre?",SBA: Cardiothoracic and vascular,Nothing,CT thoracic angiogram,CT whole aorta angiogram,MR angiogram,CXR,A,58%,4%,36%,1%,2%,"Explanation:
This patient has a diagnosis already and is haemodynamically unstable. If the patient is suitable for active management he should be taken to theatre without delay.
In a haemodynamically stable patient for whom the diagnosis was in doubt the correct study to perform would be a cardiac-gated CT aortogram:
Unenhanced CT thorax - This phase is important in the diagnosis of an intramural haematoma which can be difficult to pinpoint on subsequent phases.
Arterial phase CT Thorax and Abdomen - It is important to know whether a dissection extends into the abdominal aorta or iliac arteries as well as whether there is any compromise of the mesenteric or renal arteries.
(Portal venous phase CT Thorax and Abdomen - This phase is not always performed but is most useful if previous repairs have been undertaken and a leak is suspected)
  Although not universally available, cardiac-gating of CT scans for acute aortic syndrome is optimal to reduce the rate of false positives which are a well-documented pit-fall to non-gated studies.
Depending on local availability, MR angiography can be a useful adjunct to CT for patients who are allergic to iodinated contrast although clearly the patient must be sufficiently stable to undergo an MRI scan.

There are a number of features which can help differentiate between an osteoporotic vertebral collapse and a metastatic one.
  Favours osteoporosis
Favours metastases
Retropulsed bony fragments
Convex posterior cortex
Fluid adjacent to the fractured end plates
Associated soft tissue masses
Multiple compression fractures
Other metastases without compression fractures

High (fatty) Intermediate
Post-Radiotherapy
Very high and homogenous Intermediate (initially high due to oedema)
Haemangioma
High High
Abnormal bone (metastases, myeloma, regeneration)
Low but enhances with Gadolinium High (fluid)
Blastic metastases (prostate, breast, TCC) and myelofibrosis
Low Low
  Metastases
Normally metastatic deposits in the spine lead to low T1 signal and high T2 signal. There should be no signal drop out on fat saturated sequences in contrast to marrow reconversion where although red marrow will experience far less signal dropout than yellow marrow, there will still be some loss in signal owing to the fat content of both types of marrow.
Sclerotic or blastic metastases return little signal on either T1 or T2 weighted sequences. These include prostate, breast or TCC metastases among others.
Breast cancer can cause lytic or sclerotic metastases or a mixed picture.
Lytic metastases are more likely than sclerotic metastases to enhance with contrast. Similarly on DWI imaging, whereas lytic metastases will usually appear hyperintense, sclerotic metastases return little signal since they contain little water.
If there is a diffuse abnormality of the bone marrow it can be difficult to identify but normal bone marrow should not be lower in signal intensity than the muscle on T1 weighted sequences.",True,"A retropulsed fragment is a fragment of bone that has been pushed backwards into the spinal canal. This type of fracture is more indicative of a pathological fracture, as it is usually caused by a tumor or infection. Osteoporotic fractures typically do not have retropulsed fragments, as the weakened bone is not strong enough to push fragments into the spinal canal.",1,"3.

In osteoporotic fractures, the vertebral body tends to collapse in a wedge shape, causing the posterior cortex to bow. This is due to the loss of bone mass and strength in osteoporosis, making the vertebra more susceptible to compression fractures.

In contrast, pathological fractures are often caused by underlying conditions such as metastatic cancer, which can weaken the bone and make it more prone to fracture. In these cases, the fracture pattern and associated findings may be different, such as retropulsed fragments, involvement of the posterior elements of the spine, or signal abnormalities at multiple levels, which are more suggestive of a pathological fracture.",B,False,B,True,"[{""page_content"": ""42\nModule 2: Musculoskeletal and trauma\n5. \nA 55-year-old woman with breast cancer and back pain \nundergoes investigation with MRI.

10731,201667,A 40-year-old athlete complains of calf claudication. On Doppler ultrasound there is popliteal stenosis. He undergoes an MRA which shows a medial slip of the medial head of gastrocnemius. What is the most likely diagnosis?,SBA: Cardiothoracic and vascular,Popliteal artery entrapment syndrome,Cystic adventitial degeneration,Buerger disease,Spinal cord stenosis,Popliteal artery chronic thrombosis,A,96%,2%,1%,0%,1%,"Explanation:
Popliteal artery entrapment syndrome (PAES)
This arises due to an anomalous insertion of the medial head of gastrocnemius which compresses the popliteal artery leading to symptoms of claudication, particularly on exertion, in an otherwise fit individual. Of note, management is surgical; surgical release has far better outcomes than endovascular stenting.
  Cystic adventitial degeneration
On MRI scanning, mucous cysts can be seen in the wall of the popliteal artery. These, like most cysts, show high T2 signal and the T1 signal can be variable depending on the quantity of mucin present. This disease has a strong male preponderance and particularly affects the popliteal artery. On MRI the signal can be variable on T1 depending on the protein content of the cyst but returns a high signal on T2.
  Spinal cord stenosis
The inclusion of this answer pertains to symptoms of neurogenic claudication which can arise in the context of spinal cord stenosis or disc pathology, typically of the lumbar spine. Sensory and/or motor deficit at the appropriate level is found on neurological examination.
  Buerger disease
This disease is strongly linked to smoking and manifests as a vasculitis of the smaller arteries. Arterial occlusion with the formation of corkscrew-shaped collaterals occurs initially in the small arteries of the hands and feet but becoming more proximal as the disease progresses. Of note the larger proximal and central arteries lack the calcification which would otherwise be seen with disease of this extent when caused by atherosclerosis. ",True,"This is the most likely diagnosis because the patient's symptoms are consistent with popliteal artery entrapment syndrome, and the Doppler ultrasound and MRA both show evidence of a stenotic lesion in the popliteal artery. Additionally, the MRA shows a medial slip of the medial head of gastrocnemius, which is a common finding in popliteal artery entrapment syndrome.",2,,A,True,"I chose option 5, Popliteal artery entrapment syndrome, because the given clinical scenario and imaging findings are consistent with this diagnosis. 

A 40-year-old athlete presenting with calf claudication indicates a possible vascular issue in the lower extremity. The Doppler ultrasound finding of popliteal stenosis further supports a vascular problem in the popliteal artery. The MRA finding of a medial slip of the medial head of gastrocnemius is a classic anatomical variation associated with Popliteal artery entrapment syndrome.

Popliteal artery entrapment syndrome occurs when there is an abnormal relationship between the popliteal artery and the surrounding musculotendinous structures, leading to compression of the artery, reduced blood flow, and symptoms such as claudication. In this case, the medial slip of the medial head of gastrocnemius is causing the entrapment and stenosis of the popliteal artery.",A,True,A,True,"[{""page_content"": ""muscle contraction.

Select ONE answer only.",SBA: Central Nervous and Head & Neck,Bright on T1 and isointense on T2 = Late subacute,Isointense on T1 and bright on T2 = Hyperacute,Iso on T1 and dark on T2 = Acute,Dark on T1 and bright on T2 = Chronic,Bright on T1 and dark on T2 = Early subacute,A,36%,6%,8%,45%,5%,"Explanation:
Please note that the question asks which finding is INCORRECTLY matched to the signal characteristics.
Chronic bleeds are dark on T1 and dark-rimmed on T2 (bright centre).
This question is to do with the imaging characteristics of blood within the brain. We can think of the intracranial space as a closed box as far as oxygen tensions go which means that blood degrades in a predictable fashion and therefore has predictable appearances on T1 and T2 according to the changes in the haemoglobin molecule. There are a few different methods to help remember the changes in appearance, one of which is the table below:
  Time-frame Haemoglobin T1 T2 Mnemonic
Hyperacute (hours)   Iso Bright - IBBY
Acute (0-2 days) Intracellular deoxyHb Dark / Iso Dark - IDDY
Early subacute (3-7 days) Intracellular metHb Bright Dark - BIDDY
Late subacute (8-30 days) Extracellular metHb Bright Bright - BABY
Chronic (> 30 days) Intracellular haemosiderin Dark Dark rim - DODO
  In real life and for the 2b exam the important distinction is around the subacute stages.
In that case, by and large, if it is bright on T1 it is subacute and T2 then decides if it is early or late subacute. The timeframes given are also important and can form the basis of 2a exam questions.
  Of the other answers provided therefore:
Bright on T1 and dark on T2 = Early subacute
Dark on T1 and bright on T2 = Chronic (the centre is T2 bright. It is the rim which is T2 dark).
Dark on T1 and dark on T2 = Acute
Isointense on T1 and bright on T2 = Hyperacute
Bright on T1 and bright on T2 = Late subacute",False,"The correct answer is 5. Bright on T1 and dark on T2 does not match any of the stages of bleeding. Isointense on T1 and bright on T2 is typically seen in hyperacute hemorrhages, bright on T1 and isointense on T2 is seen in late subacute hemorrhages, isointense on T1 and dark on T2 is seen in acute hemorrhages, and dark on T1 and bright on T2 is seen in chronic hemorrhages.",1,"3.

He undergoes a CT scan on which can be seen marked circumferential bowel wall thickening affecting the entire colon. There is only minimal pericolonic stranding. There is ascites and the small bowel looks normal.

Ascites is seen in patients with pseudomembranous colitis. The exact prevalence is not robustly demonstrable in literature at present but certainly the presence of ascites can be a useful discriminatory since inflammatory bowel diseases tend NOT to show ascites.
Pseudomembranous colitis
Antibiotic therapy, particularly with broad spectrum penicillins, can deplete the normal colonic flora and permit overgrowth of clostridium difficile. Some patients may be asymptomatic from this overgrowth but others can develop pseudomembranous colitis. There will be a profuse watery diarrhoea with abdominal pains and fever. The condition is defined by the development of a pseudomembrane of exuded fibrin and cellular debris within the colon seen on endoscopy. Both endoscopic and fluoroscopic examinations are contraindicated in severe cases owing to the risk of perforation. On CT around a third of patients have no findings at all but more usually there is diffuse colonic wall thickening affecting the entire colon and to an extent which is not seen in any other disease process (except Crohn disease).The accordion sign occurs when oral contrast medium sits between the closely spaced oedematous folds of the colon. Pericolonic fat stranding is disproportionately mild but ascites is a common co-existent finding. Complicating features which should be ruled out on a CT scan include toxic megacolon, pneumatosis coli and portal venous gas.",False,"The presence of marked circumferential bowel wall thickening is more indicative of a diagnosis of pseudomembranous colitis as opposed to inflammatory bowel disease.

12591,201667,A 31-year-old lady who delivered by vaginal delivery 2 years ago following a pregnancy complicated by pre-eclampsia complains of secondary amenorrhoea. Her GP thinks she might be suffering from pre-eclampsia due to an occult pregnancy but a serum pregnancy test is negative. She is taken for a scan. What are the expected imaging features?,SBA: Central Nervous and Head & Neck,Atrophic pituitary,Haemorrhage into enlarged pituitary lobe and ischaemic changes in both occipital lobes on CT,Low attenuation and loss of grey/white matter differentiation in both occipital lobes,A moderate volume of sub-arachnoid blood,Homogeneous enlargement of the pituitary showing high T1 and low T2 on MRI,A,64%,15%,5%,1%,15%,"Explanation:
Sheehan syndrome is consequent on obstetric hypovolaemia. Pre-eclampsia certainly increases the risk of peri-partum haemorrhage and with little further information provided, Sheehan syndrome is a viable option. Chronically, the pituitary of a patient with Sheehan syndrome becomes atrophic to the point of radiological invisibility (empty sella).
    Pituitary apoplexy
Pathologically, pituitary apoplexy is infarction which can take place with or without haemorrhage. Over half of patients have an underlying macroadenoma; haemorrhage into a pre-existing macroadenoma is the usual presentation. 'All' patients present with a headache and panhypopituitarism. Visual impairment is also common as the pituitary enlarges and impacts on the chiasm. On a CT scan there will be a sellar/suprasellar mass (ie pituitary enlargement). Hyperdensity is caused by the underlying haemorrhage, if present. On an MRI, the pituitary can be seen to be enlarged with T1 hyperintensity (specifically in the subacute phases). In the chronic phase however, the pituitary will be involuted and small, even appearing as an 'empty sella'.
  Sheehan syndrome is pituitary apoplexy due to hypovolaemic shock and can be consequential to delivery. At the time of apoplexy, the predominant issue for the patient is the systemic hypovolaemia for which aggressive management is usually already being pursued. In the early days following the delivery, the first hypopituitary issues to manifest is usually any or all of hyponatraemia, diabetes insipidus or hypothyroidism. At this time the MRI findings can vary from a normal appearing pituitary through to the classic pituitary apoplexy appearances of an enlarged pituitary with high T1 signal. Patients can also present many months or years later with panhypoituitarism at which time an MRI will usually show an empty sella.
  Sheehan syndrome is pituitary apoplexy due to hypovolaemic shock and can be consequential to delivery. The visual field problems can be caused by pressure effects on the optic chiasm. The answer given describes the classical appearance for Sheehan syndrome in the acute setting. The answer âhaemorrhage into enlarged pituitary lobeâ would be an arguable second best answer however the occipital lobe changes are not related to Sheehan syndrome but again this would be in the acute setting. Of the answers offered, pituitary atrophy is the most likely finding in the chronic setting.",True,"Answer: 5. Atrophic pituitary. Pre-eclampsia is a condition that can cause secondary amenorrhoea due to the high blood pressure and other physiological changes associated with the condition. It can also cause ischaemia to the pituitary gland, leading to atrophic changes in the gland. This can be seen on MRI as homogeneous enlargement of the pituitary gland with high T1 and low T2 signal intensity.",3,"3. A question about clinical problem-solving, what tests or treatments should be used?

This question falls under category 3: A question about clinical problem-solving, what tests or treatments should be used?",D,False,"I chose option 2 because the clinical scenario suggests the possibility of Sheehan's syndrome, which is a condition that occurs due to ischemic necrosis of the pituitary gland following severe postpartum hemorrhage. The pituitary gland is particularly vulnerable to ischemia in the postpartum period due to its enlargement during pregnancy. 

In Sheehan's syndrome, imaging features may include hemorrhage into the enlarged pituitary gland and ischemic changes. On a CT scan, these ischemic changes can be observed in both occipital lobes. The other options do not accurately describe the expected imaging features of Sheehan's syndrome:

1. Atrophic pituitary: This may be seen in the chronic phase of Sheehan's syndrome, but the question is focused on the acute presentation.
3. Low attenuation and loss of grey/white matter differentiation in both occipital lobes: This is a nonspecific finding and not directly related to Sheehan's syndrome.
4. A moderate volume of sub-arachnoid blood: This finding suggests a subarachnoid hemorrhage, which is not related to Sheehan's syndrome.
5. Homogeneous enlargement of the pituitary showing high T1 and low T2 on MRI: This finding is not specific for Sheehan's syndrome and could be seen in other pituitary pathologies.

Therefore, option 2 is the most appropriate choice for the expected imaging features in this clinical scenario.",B,False,D,False,"[{""page_content"": ""E. \nHypoxic brain injury\n5. \nWhich is the best answer describing neuro-imaging features \nof pre-eclampsia?\n \nA.

11131,201667,A 29-year-old man with back pain has an MRI which shows an eccentrically lesion expanding spinal cord centred at T4. It is hyperintense on T2 with some enhancement post contrast. The interpedicular distance at this level is widened. What is the most likely diagnosis?,SBA: Musculoskeletal and Trauma,Astrocytoma,Haemangioblastoma,Epidermoid,PNET,Ganglioglioma,A,62%,12%,15%,3%,8%,"Explanation:
This question pertains to spinal lesions. The characteristics of the lesions listed should all be relatively familiar to the candidate but their features are a little different when considered as spinal lesions. The main other differential diagnosis not given is a spinal ependymoma. By and large for an intramedullary lesion in the cord of a young adult the differential diagnosis is between an Ependymoma and an Astrocytoma. There are a few features which separate them. Ependymomas are far and away the most common intramedullary spinal cord tumour though.
  Astrocytoma
Spinal astrocytomas are the second most common intramedullary spinal tumour in adults.There is overlap of many of the features of astrocytomas and ependymomas. Eccentricity within the axial slice of the cord is a strong pointer to it being an astrocytoma as opposed to an Ependymoma (although the latter hasnât been given as an alternative).Ependymomas tend to show avid contrast enhancement whereas what has been described here is less severe than that.
  Haemangioblastoma
The classic description for haemangioblastomas is of a cyst with an enhancing nodule. This occurs far less commonly in spinal haemangioblastomas than it does for posterior fossa ones. Cystic components are still extremely common for spinal haemangioblastomas however. On MRI spinal haemangioblastomas are iso or high on T1 and high on T2. Sometimes they can cause polycythaemia due to erythropoietin production.
  Epidermoid
These tumours are usually extramedullary and there is a strong association with vertebral anomalies. The imaging feature usually tested is that they restrict diffusion.
  PNET(primitive neuroectoderm tumour)
The age range for intracranial PNET is quoted as < 5 years. Spinal PNETs have been reported in the literature as case reports but are very rare.
  Ganglioglioma
Spinal gangliomas are a reasonable differential diagnosis for intramedullary cord lesions however are more prevalent in the paediatric cohort and still far less common than ependymomas. They tend to show heterogeneity on T1.",False,"Ganglioglioma is the most likely diagnosis because it is a tumor that typically affects the spine, is hyperintense on T2-weighted MRI scans, and is associated with widening of the interpedicular distance. It is also known to cause back pain, which is a symptom the patient is experiencing.",2,,E,False,"I chose option 2, Haemangioblastoma, as the most likely diagnosis based on the given MRI findings. The description of an eccentrically expanding spinal cord lesion that is hyperintense on T2 and shows some enhancement post contrast is more characteristic of a haemangioblastoma. Additionally, the widened interpedicular distance at the T4 level further supports this diagnosis, as it indicates the presence of a space-occupying lesion.

Haemangioblastomas are vascular tumors that can occur in the spinal cord, and they typically present with these imaging features. While some of the other options, such as astrocytoma or ganglioglioma, may also present as spinal cord lesions, their imaging characteristics and locations differ from those described in the question.",B,True,A,True,"[{""page_content"": ""16) A 46-year-old female presents with back pain and increasing\nweakness of the lower limbs.

13706,201667,You are performing a trans-vaginal ultrasound lady on a 27-year-old lady. She presented to A+E with severe acute pelvic pain and vomiting. She denies per vaginum bleeding and a beta-hcg test was performed which was elevated. The gynaecology registrar suspects she may have an ectopic pregnancy. Which of the following is most specific for an ectopic pregnancy?,"SBA: Genito urinary, Adrenal, Obstetrics & Gynaecology and Breast",A decidual cast,A yolk sac,A double decidual layer,Endometrial thickening,A corpus luteum cyst,A,35%,22%,30%,10%,3%,"Explanation:
A decidual cast refers to the appeance of echogenic debris within the uterine cavity in the context of an ectopic pregnancy. All the other signs also occur in an intra-uterine pregnancy.
  Ectopic pregnancy 
Vaginal bleeding is very common in early pregnancy but vaginal bleeding with pain or pain without vaginal bleeding definitely call for an ectopic pregnancy to be excluded. Factors which increase the risk of ectopic pregnancy include:
Previous ectopic 
IVF conception
Previous surgery to the Fallopian tubes
PID

Since most present around 7-8 weeks gestation it is usual that the woman will not yet have had the first routine ultrasound scan, or in many cases, may not yet be aware of the pregnancy at all. Serial serum beta HCGs usually fail to double in the usual 48hours for ectopic pregnancies. The exact level of beta HCG helps guide the sonographer as to what they can expect to find. An ectopic pregnancy is most commonly located within one or other Fallopian tube. Ultrasound will fail to show an intrauterine pregnancy and the ectopic pregnancy can often be seen as a cystic mass elsewhere. The classic âring of fireâ sign refers to the peripheral colour Doppler flow seen on an ectopic pregnancy although this can also be seen on a normal corpus luteal cyst. 
Finding Chance of ectopic
Tubal ring sign - echogenic ring around the ectopic 95%
Complex adnexal cystic mass 95%
Free fluid + empty uterus (+B-hcg) 70%
Pseudogestational sac 20%
Simple adnexal cyst 10%
  Ultrasound findings in early pregnancy
A double decidual layer may be identifiable in an early pregnancy at an earlier stage than a yolk sac. Its presence can disprove the diagnosis of an ectopic pregnancy but its absence should not be used to confirm the diagnosis of an ectopic pregnancy. It is seen as two concentric rings around a sac of fluid.
A pseudogestational sac refers to the presence of fluid within the endometrial cavity which could be mistaken for a true gestational sac. The pseudo-finding is usually central to the endometrial cavity whereas a true sac is often eccentrically placed.  Importantly, there will be no yolk sac in a pseudogestational sac; a feature which defines a gestational sac.
  The corpus luteum
The corpus luteum consists of the remnant of a ruptured ovarian follicle following ovulation. It produces oestrogen and progesterone to sustain a pregnancy following fertilisation. On ultrasound it is seen as a thick walled cyst with peripheral vascularity on colour Doppler flow. This 'ring of fire' appearance can be confused with an ectopic pregnancy.",False,"A yolk sac is the most specific indicator of an ectopic pregnancy because it is an early sign of a developing fetus, and it is only present in a normal intrauterine pregnancy. The other options listed can be present in both ectopic and normal pregnancies, making them less specific for an ectopic pregnancy.",2,"3.

Explanation: A yolk sac is the most specific for an ectopic pregnancy because it is an early sign of a developing embryo outside of the uterus. In a normal pregnancy, the yolk sac would be found within the uterus, but in an ectopic pregnancy, it is located outside the uterine cavity, usually in the fallopian tube.

Select ONE answer only.,"SBA: Genito urinary, Adrenal, Obstetrics & Gynaecology and Breast",Segmental branches,Interlobar arteries,Arcuate arteries,Interlobular arteries,The vasa recta,A,62%,28%,4%,5%,1%,"Explanation:
The arterial supply to the kidneys is from the renal arteries, two fast flowing arteries that arise from the abdominal aorta at the L2 vertebral level. As the abdominal aorta is situated slightly to the left of the midline the right renal artery is longer than the left. The kidneys receive approximately 20% of the cardiac output.
After arising from the aorta, the right renal artery passes behind the inferior vena cava, the right renal vein, the head of the pancreas, and the second part of the duodenum as it travels to the kidney. The left renal artery passes behind the left renal vein, the body of the pancreas and the splenic vein as it travels to the kidney. The left renal artery is crossed anteriorly by the inferior mesenteric vein.
The renal arteries then enter the kidney at thehila of the kidneys, which lie approximately in the transpyloric plane at the L1 vertebral level. At the hila the renal arteries divide into four or five segmental branches.
Each segmental branch divides to form the interlobar arteries that are situated on either side of every renal pyramid. These interlobar arteries then undergo further division to form the arcuate arteries.
The interlobular arteries are then given off at right angles from the side of the arcuate arteries, and head into the cortical substance. Once within the cortex a final division takes place with the interlobular arteries dividing to form the efferent arterioles.
In the outer two-thirds of the cortex, the efferent arterioles form the peritubular network. The inner third of the cortex is supplied by long, straight arteries known as the vasa recta.

10376,201667,A 7mm peripherally located fat density partly calcified lung lesion suspected to be a pulmonary hamartoma is being reviewed in the MDT. The patient is a known smoker.  What follow up should you recommend?,SBA: Cardiothoracic and vascular,None,CT 3/12,CT 6/12,Biopsy,CXR in 3/12,A,85%,7%,5%,1%,1%,"Explanation:
With the presence of fat density the diagnosis of hamartoma can be made and consequently no follow up is required.
Fat within a thoracic mass is diagnostic of a hamartoma but is only seen in approximately half of cases. In contradistinction to carcinoid tumours, hamartomas tend to be peripherally located whereas carcinoid tumours are often more central. Exceptions to both are reasonably frequent however. Calcification, especially popcorn calcification, is also very classical for hamartomas if present. Cavitation is not a feature often associated with them, but it can be found occasionally. Chondromas (very similar to hamartomas radiologically, but distinct entities histologically) form part of the Carney triad (pulmonary chondromas, gastric leiomyosarcomas and extra-adrenal paragangliomas). NB this is different from Carney complex (atrial myxoma, facial/buccal pigmentation, sertoli tumours of the testis and multiple other findings).

9261,201667,"You are reviewing the images of a 41-year-old female patient who has previously undergone a wide local excision for T1N0 DCIS to the left breast. She subsequently had an ultrasound scan which made an incidental note of a 5cm liver lesion. She goes on to have an MRI scan and the lesion is reported as returning high signal on T2 weighted images and T1 weighted arterial phases, becoming isointense on portal venous phases and showing delayed enhancement of a central scar. What is the most likely diagnosis?",SBA: Gastrointestinal,Focal nodular hyperplasia,Simple cyst,Fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma,Breast metastasis,Focal steatosis,A,90%,0%,8%,1%,0%,"Explanation:
Focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH)
These lesions typically occur in women in late middle age. They are not caused by oral contraceptive use however they do enlarge in response to hormone stimulation. They are composed of hyperplastic hepatocytes and are thought to arise when a small underlying congenital vascular malformation means that an area of the liver receives a better blood supply and therefore grows better, thus they lack a true capsule but can outgrow their blood supply resulting in the classical central fibrous scar which is present in around half of cases. On imaging they do demonstrate mass effect, displacing adjacent vessels, have marked arterial enhancement which fits in with their supposed aetiology. The central scar enhances only on delayed sequences. On MRI they tend to return high signal on T2 weighted sequences. Their appearance on contrast enhanced ultrasound is interesting; the central scar enhances very early in the arterial phase, branching out in a spoke-wheel type of appearance. During the main arterial phase the lesions enhance strongly before becoming isoechoic in the portal venous phase.
  Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)
Although metastases are the most common cause of malignant hepatic lesions, hepatocellular carcinoma is the most common primary hepatic malignancy. It usually arises on a background of cirrhosis of any cause. Patients with any of the hepatitis viruses, alcoholic cirrhosis, haemochromatosis, and Wilson disease are all at risk. Carcinogens such as thorotrast and aflatoxin also predispose to HCC formation. Serum alpha fetoprotein levels are often raised, in contrast with cholangiocarcinomas which are one of the main differential diagnoses.
Thorotrast is a carcinogenic historic contrast agent used in the 30s and 40s. Its use was abruptly curtailed once it was realised that it is retained indefinitely in the reticuloendothelial system. It causes hepatocellular carcinomas and cholangiocarcinomas but hepatic angiosarcomas are the most frequently quoted related malignancies.
On imaging HCCs can have a variety of appearances. A large irregular mass with satellite nodules is the most common finding but a diffuse infiltrative version can also occur. Since HCCs derive their blood supply from the hepatic artery they show arterial enhancement on CT with washout on later phases. On ultrasound HCCs tend to be hypoechoic when compared to the rest of the liver and on MRI they show variable signal intensity on both T1 and T2 but arterial enhancement with venous washout can again be seen once Gadolinium has been given.
Fibrolamellar carcinoma of the liver is a specific subtype which occurs in slightly younger patients with otherwise normal livers. It is an echogenic lobulated mass on ultrasound with a central fibrous scar which does not enhance on CT. The lack of enhancement with, and sometimes presence of calcification, in the scar separates it from fibrous nodular hyperplasia which is the main differential diagnosis. On MRI the scar returns low signal on T1 and T2 owing to its fibrous nature.
  Breast metastasis
The breast cancer detailed in this question is a red herring. Although secondary hepatic lesions are more common than primary ones, the very low staging of this ladyâs breast cancer as well as the imaging characteristics given makes HCC the most likely diagnosis.
  Focal steatosis also known as focal fatty infiltration
The liver plays a small role in fat storage and subtle variation in blood supply and drainage between different areas can lead to variations in the amount of fat in those areas. Focal fatty change is very common and has a geographic appearance on all imaging modalities, with a lack of mass effect (ie preservation of the vascular architecture). It can occur anywhere within the liver but is classically found adjacent to the falciform ligament (i.e. segments II, III and IV). Fat-identifying sequences on MRI can be very useful to clinch the diagnosis with signal dropout on out-of-phase images.
  Simple cyst
Hepatic cysts are very common and usually of no consequence. Multiple cysts do occur in the normal population as well as in patients with von Hippel Lindau syndrome or adult polycystic kidney disease. On ultrasound they are well defined, anechoic with posterior acoustic enhancement and no internal vascularity. On MRI they follow water on all sequences. On CT they have Hounsfield Units of 0-10 and do not enhance.",False,"The MRI findings described in the patient are consistent with a diagnosis of fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma. This type of liver cancer typically presents as a large, solitary, well-defined lesion with high signal on T2-weighted images and T1-weighted arterial phases, becoming isointense on portal venous phases and showing delayed enhancement of a central scar. This is in contrast to other liver lesions such as simple cysts, focal nodular hyperplasia, and focal steatosis, which typically show different imaging characteristics.",2,,C,True,"I chose option 4, Focal Nodular Hyperplasia (FNH), as the most likely diagnosis because the MRI findings described are characteristic of FNH. FNH is a benign liver lesion and the MRI features mentioned, such as high signal on T2 weighted images, T1 weighted arterial phase enhancement, isointensity on portal venous phase, and delayed enhancement of a central scar, are consistent with this diagnosis.

The abdominal lymph nodes can be broadly divided into pre-aortic and para-aortic groups, depending upon their relationship to the aorta.
The pre-aortic nodes lie anterior to the aorta and lie around the origins of the visceral (anterior) arteries.

These nodes can be further divided into three groups, each lying near to the origins of their respective artery:
Coeliac lymph nodes
Superior mesenteric lymph nodes
Inferior mesenteric lymph nodes
  All of the efferent lymphatics from the pre-aortic nodes drain into the intestinal trunk, which in turn drains into the cisterna chlyi.

In which space is the lesion most likely to be?,SBA: Central Nervous and Head & Neck,Carotid,Parotid,Masticator,Retropharayngeal,Pharyngeal mucosal,A,71%,3%,2%,20%,3%,"Explanation:
Head and neck anatomy is all about the parapharyngeal space and its relationships. The parapharyngeal space is a small and unobtrusive space itself containing only fat, some branches of the trigeminal nerve and a few vessels but is sat right in the middle of the soft tissues of the neck on each side and as a result gets pushed about when the surrounding spaces are invaded. It is therefore the head and neck radiologistâs best friend.
The best way to learn which spaces displace the parapharyngeal space which way is to draw it out on rough paper a few times. The following table provides a summary:

  Retraction of the liver capsule, along with delayed enhancement are characteristic features of cholangiocarcinoma. The mass is usually infiltrative rather than having a well defined margin. Metastases to the lung are rare, but seen occasionally, manifesting as nodules. Primary sclerosing cholangitis is a major risk factor.

Trauma is by far the most common cause of pancreatitis in the paediatric population. Handlebar injury and seatbelt injury are the most common type, but donât forget the possibility of non-accidental injury too.
Annular pancreas usually presents in children as duodenal obstruction, whereas in adults pancreatitis is a more common presentation of this anatomical variant.
Cystic fibrosis causes complete fatty replacement of the pancreas or lipomatous pseudohypertrophy of the pancreas.
Pseudopapillary tumours of the pancreas are rare, benign tumours of the pancreas which usually present in females 15-30 years of age. Pancreatitis as a result of this tumour is possible, but not recognised as a regular complication.

10616,201667,Which of the following features if noted on a CT abdominal angiogram would render an abdominal aortic aneurysm unsuitable for endovascular repair? Select one answer only.,SBA: Cardiothoracic and vascular,7mm infrarenal neck,Common iliac artery diameter of 10mm,Common iliac artery length of 20mm,Neck angle 100 deg,Iliac artery angle >90 deg,D,38%,9%,4%,30%,19%,"Explanation:
The angle of the neck should be either below 60deg or above 120deg depending on the system used to measure. 100deg falls outside of both of these systems.
For the most part it will be the vascular surgeons or interventional radiologists themselves who decide on a case-by-case basis whether they themselves are prepared to attempt endovascular repair of a given aneurysm. Broadly speaking however, there are a number of criteria which the surgeon or interventionalist would be wise to abide by:
Distance to the renal arteries â 10mm used to be the absolute minimum landing zone distance required but many of the grafts would required a minimum of 15mm. If the landing zone is less than 10mm a fenestrated graft must be used to preserve the patency of the renal arteries.
Angle of the neck â this is measured one of two ways in the literature. Consequently there are two different values for an acceptable angle. A purely straight aneurysm would have a neck angle of either 180o or 0o in each of the different measuring systems. Thus the acceptable neck cut-off values are 120o or 60o in each case.
Angle of the common iliac artery â fortunately this is easier to remember. Iliac arteries at 90o or worse are significantly harder to stent. Further consideration is usually given to the overall tortuosity of the iliac arteries but this relates to endovascular access as opposed to stent deployment.
Common iliac artery (CIA) length â Ideally the CIA should be longer than 20mm to accommodate the stents used. Shorter lengths may require landing in the external iliac artery with deliberate occlusion of the internal iliac artery and reliance on pelvic collaterals.
Common iliac artery diameter â Stents are difficult (not impossible) to place where the diameter of the CIA is less than 7mm. 
Some of these limitations are more flexible than others. Where limitations make stents 'difficult' or 'harder' to place, this does not entirely contra-indicate the procedure.",False,"I chose number 5 because an iliac artery angle greater than 90 degrees is considered a contraindication for endovascular repair of an abdominal aortic aneurysm. This is because a large angle can make it difficult to access the aneurysm with a stent graft, and can also increase the risk of stent graft migration.",1,"This question falls under category 1: Basic factual recall, either of basic science, physics, anatomy or regarding a procedure.",E,True,"I chose option 4 (Neck angle 100 deg) because it refers to the angle between the aneurysm and the aorta's normal course. In endovascular repair of abdominal aortic aneurysm (EVAR), a suitable neck angle is crucial for the proper placement and sealing of the stent graft. A neck angle of 100 degrees is considered unfavorable for EVAR, as it may lead to complications such as endoleaks, stent graft migration, or even failure of the repair. Generally, a neck angle of less than 60 degrees is preferred for endovascular repair.",D,True,A,True,"[{""page_content"": ""SUMMARY BOX: Anatomical Consideration in Abdominal \nAortic Aneurysm Endovascular Aneurysm Repaira\nInfrarenal landing neck length\n>8 mm or 15 mmb\nInfrarenal angulation\n<75\u00b0 or 60\u00b0b\nSuprarenal angulation\n<45\u00b0b\nNeck diameterc\nInside or outside diameter: 17\u201332 mma\nIliac landing neck length\n10\u201320 mmb\nIliac landing diameterc\n8\u201322 mma\nAccess vessel size\nCompatibility with the required \ndelivery systems\nA\nB\nC"", ""metadata"": {""source"": ""source_documents\\Grainger & Allison\u2019s Diagnostic Radiology_ A Textbook of Medical Imaging (2020).pdf"", ""file_path"": ""source_documents\\Grainger & Allison\u2019s Diagnostic Radiology_ A Textbook of Medical Imaging (2020).pdf"", ""page"": 2065, ""total_pages"": 2218, ""format"": ""PDF 1.7"", ""title"": """", ""author"": """", ""subject"": """", ""keywords"": """", ""creator"": ""afkebooks.com"", ""producer"": ""afkebooks.com"", ""creationDate"": ""D:20200822184208+02'00'"", ""modDate"": ""D:20200822200513+02'00'"", ""trapped"": """"}}, {""page_content"": ""CHAPTER 17 The Thoracic Aorta: Diagnostic Aspects\n439\nC\nB\nA\nFig. 17.28 Multidetector computed tomography coronal multiplanar reformation (A) and curved reformations \n(B and C) of the abdominal aorta in a patient affected by abdominal aneurysm.

14416,201667,A 40-year-old man undergoes a CT scan of his chest. This shows thickening of the pericardium measuring around 5mm. The right ventricle is small and there is straightening of the interventricular septum. Ascites can be seen in the included upper abdomen. What is the SINGLE most likely diagnosis?,SBA: Cardiothoracic and vascular,Aortic dissection type A,Aortic dissection type B,Constrictive pericarditis,Lobar pulmonary emboli,Lymphoma,C,1%,1%,96%,2%,1%,"Explanation:
Constrictive pericarditis
Inflammation of the pericardium is termed pericarditis and leads to fibrous thickening. Most commonly this occurs either post-operatively in patients undergoing cardiac surgery or as an idiopathic entity although historically it was tuberculosis which was the most common cause of pericarditis. The diagnosis is predominantly clinical with symptoms such as malaise or dyspnoea and signs such as neck vein distension or paradoxical movement of the JVP. On cross sectional imaging thickening of the pericardium to greater than 2mm can be seen and the fibrosis causes a restriction in distensibility. The right ventricle, being more compliant than the left, becomes flattened and furthermore there can be straightening or curvature of the septum towards the left. Elsewhere, if the field of view permits, accessory signs such as pleural effusions and even ascites may be seen.
  Infectious pericarditis
Enhancement of the pericardium suggests active inflammation. Locules of gas within a pericardial effusion suggest the presence of gas forming organisms, though these are rarely seen. Fat stranding may be seen within the fat of the adjacent mediastinum.
  Pulmonary Emboli
There is some cross-over of the signs and symptoms of pericarditis and a large lobar embolus. On CT, if the embolus is large enough to cause right ventricular strain the septum can sometimes appear bowed with reflux of IV contrast into the hepatic veins.
  Aortic dissection
Dissections are classified according to their involvement of the aortic root and their distal extent. There are two different classification systems. The Stanford classification is more useful clinically since the primary decision post-diagnosis is whether the dissection will be managed surgically or medically. Those involving the proximal aorta and arch are managed surgically. If the arch is not involved, the patient can be managed medically. Thus, Stanford A dissections involve the aorta proximal to the origin of the left subclavian artery with or without concurrent distal involvement. Stanford B dissections do not involve the proximal aorta. Where a dissection extends proximally and causes pericardial tamponade the clinical signs and symptoms may well occur, however the presence of effusions and pitting oedema do not fit with the correct answer being aortic dissection.",True,"Constrictive pericarditis is the most likely diagnosis because the CT scan shows thickening of the pericardium, which is one of the primary symptoms of this condition. Additionally, the CT scan also shows a small right ventricle and straightening of the interventricular septum, which are both associated with constrictive pericarditis. Ascites in the upper abdomen can also be seen in cases of constrictive pericarditis, making it the most likely diagnosis.",2,,C,True,"I chose option 3, Constrictive pericarditis, because the clinical findings described in the question are consistent with this diagnosis. 

Thickening of the pericardium measuring around 5mm: In constrictive pericarditis, the pericardium becomes thickened and fibrotic, which can be seen on a CT scan. A normal pericardium is usually less than 2mm thick, so a measurement of 5mm is suggestive of thickening.

The right ventricle is small and there is straightening of the interventricular septum: In constrictive pericarditis, the thickened and fibrotic pericardium restricts the diastolic filling of the heart, leading to reduced ventricular sizes, especially the right ventricle. The straightening of the interventricular septum is also a sign of ventricular interdependence, which occurs in constrictive pericarditis.

Ascites can be seen in the included upper abdomen: Constrictive pericarditis can lead to increased central venous pressure, which in turn can cause fluid accumulation in the abdomen, known as ascites.

The other options are less likely based on the given findings:

1. Aortic dissection type A and 2. Aortic dissection type B: These conditions involve a tear in the aortic wall and would typically present with acute chest pain and radiological findings such as an intimal flap or dilated aorta, which are not mentioned in the question.

4. Lobar pulmonary emboli: This condition involves a blood clot in the pulmonary arteries and would present with acute shortness of breath, chest pain, and findings such as filling defects in the pulmonary arteries on imaging, which are not mentioned in the question.

5. Lymphoma: While lymphoma can involve the pericardium, it would not typically cause the specific findings described in the question, such as a small right ventricle and straightening of the interventricular septum.

He undergoes a CT angiogram that shows a clear blush of contrast near the end of the stent graft.What kind of leak is this? What kind of leak is this?,SBA: Cardiothoracic and vascular,Endoleak type I,Endoleak type II,Endoleak type IV,Exoleak type I,Exoleak type II,A,68%,11%,3%,13%,4%,"Explanation:
Type I endoleaks occur at the landing zones of the stent, either proximally or distally.
Type II endoleaks are the most common and occur when there is collateral filling of the aneurysm sac, usually via the lumbar arteries or retrograde via the inferior mesenteric artery via the marginal artery of Drummond. The need for intervention is usually determined by growth in sac size. Where a leak is stable, with no growth in sac size, intervention is not always necessary and the leak should resolve with time. If the sac does continue to expand the culprit lumbar artery could be embolised via an endovascular technique.
Type III endoleaks occur due to a defect in the wall of the graft that can be mechanical or iatrogenic.
Type IV endoleaks occur due to porosity of the graft material
Type V endoleaks are a âcatch allâ classification often thought to occur due an unidentified type I-IV leak.",True,"Endoleak type I is the type of leak that occurs when there is a breach in the stent graft wall, allowing blood to flow through the defect and out of the stent graft. This is the type of leak seen in the CT angiogram, as the contrast is seen near the end of the stent graft.",2,3. A question about the interpretation of medical images.,B,True,"I chose Endoleak type I because the scenario describes a patient who recently underwent a stent graft repair for an infra-renal aneurysm and has a CT angiogram showing a contrast blush near the end of the stent graft. This suggests that blood is leaking around the attachment site of the stent graft, which is characteristic of an Endoleak type I.

Endoleak type I occurs when there is an incomplete seal at the attachment sites of the stent graft, either proximally (type IA) or distally (type IB). This allows blood to continue to flow into the aneurysm sac, increasing the risk of rupture. It is considered a high-pressure leak and usually requires urgent intervention to prevent complications.",A,True,A,True,"[{""page_content"": ""\u2022 \nType 5: This is endotension.

13830,201667,A baby boy is born following a concealed pregnancy. He develops a high respiratory rate shortly after birth and a chest radiograph is performed which demonstrates cardiomegaly.

What other finding on the echocardiogram is most likely?,SBA: Cardiothoracic and vascular,Tricuspid atresia,Aortic stenosis,Aortic regurgitation,Mitral stenosis,Mitral regurgitation,A,57%,9%,6%,13%,14%,"Explanation:
Tricuspid atresia
This occurs with right ventricular hypoplasia (and often ASD or PFO) as part of a congenital abnormality. It can also be associated with asplenia.
  Mitral regurgitation
Chronic regurgitation causes left atrial enlargement with splaying of the carina and a double right heart border. It is also the only valvular pathology associated with isolated right upper lobe pulmonary oedema.
  Aortic stenosis
This can be congenital or acquired. Dilation of ascending aorta is seen due to a jet from the stenosis. Concentric left ventricular hypertrophy is occasionally a feature.
  Aortic regurgitation
This is usually secondary to bacterial endocarditis, Marfanâs, bicuspid aortic valve or aortic root dilatation (due to hypertension).
  Mitral stenosis
The most common cause of mitral stenosis is rheumatic heart disease. It can cause left atrial dilatation, but is not associated with right upper lobe pulmonary oedema.",True,"Tricuspid atresia is a congenital heart defect in which the tricuspid valve is absent or not properly formed. This defect is often associated with cardiomegaly, an absent spleen, and a ventricular septal defect. Therefore, it is the most likely finding on the echocardiogram based on the given information.",2,"3. A question about the application of knowledge, what is the best treatment?

This question falls under Category 2: A question about clinical judgement, what is the correct diagnosis?",E,False,"I chose option 1, Aortic stenosis, because the clinical scenario provided suggests the baby may have a congenital heart defect. The combination of cardiomegaly, ventricular septal defect, and the absence of a spleen indicates a possible association with a congenital heart condition called ""Shone's complex"" or ""Shone's syndrome.""

Shone's complex is a rare congenital heart disease characterized by a combination of left-sided heart lesions, which typically include:

1. Aortic stenosis (narrowing of the aortic valve)
2. Coarctation of the aorta (narrowing of the aorta)
3. Ventricular septal defect (a hole between the lower chambers of the heart)

Lipoma arborescens
This condition can affect children or adults and is thought to be a reaction to chronic inflammation of the synovium leading to extensive fatty infiltration of the synovium. It is almost always the knee which is affected. Plain radiographs will show only an effusion, which may be large, but on MRI there is frond-like or nodular synovial proliferation which returns fat-signal according to the different sequences used. The signal should be high on T1 and T2 but suppress on fat-saturated sequences. Post-contrast the synovium itself will enhance. Treatment is by synovectomy.",True,The correct answer is 3. Frond-like proliferation of the synovium with high T1 and T2 signal. Lipoma arborescens is a condition where the synovial membrane becomes thickened and filled with fat.

What is the most likely diagnosis?","SBA: Genito urinary, Adrenal, Obstetrics & Gynaecology and Breast",Phyllodes tumour,Fibroid,Abscess,Galactocoele,Radial scar,A,57%,33%,2%,3%,5%,"Explanation:
A Phyllodes tumour
These would typically be described as having a similar appearance to a fibroadenoma. They would usually appear as a lobulated round hypoechoic mass with ill-defined borders and a posterior acoustic enhancement. Occasionally they can demonstrate a âhaloâ sign. Patients are usually middle aged, slightly older than those with a fibroadenoma.
  Fibroadenoma
Popcorn calcification is pathognomonic of a fibroadenoma. They tend to be nodular or lobulated in contour but with smooth margins. They often show a âhaloâ sign of low attenuation where tissue surrounding the lesion has been compressed. Patients are usually relatively young; 20s or 30s.
  Galactocoele
A galactocoele appears during lactation as an enlarging painless mass. A fat-fluid level is a specific finding on a lateral view. These lesions would be far more likely to be ultrasound diagnoses than mammographic. They can have a variety of appearances, ranging from cystic with internal debris, to solid appearing masses. Posterior acoustic is an important feature which suggests a fluid component to the mass. Diagnosis is typically confirmed by aspirating milk from the lesion.
  Breast abscess
Clinical manifestations notwithstanding, would appear cystic on ultrasound.
  Radial scar

Around half are associated with a carcinoma and hence management is usually surgical excision.",True,"Phyllodes tumours are the most common type of soft tissue breast lesion in women aged over 65. They are typically well-defined, oval-shaped, and composed of both benign and malignant cells. Phyllodes tumours can also be associated with a lump in the breast, which makes it the most likely diagnosis in this case.",2,,A,False,"I chose option 2, an abscess, because it is a relatively common cause of a lump in the breast, especially in a 65-year-old lady.

14195,201667,You are reviewing the abdominal radiograph of a man who has presented to A&E with acute severe abdominal pain. His x-ray shows dilatation of the transverse colon.

Select ONE answer only.,SBA: Gastrointestinal,Ileus,Ulcerative colitis,Crohn's disease,Ischaemic colitis,Amoebiasis,A,55%,2%,14%,6%,22%,"Explanation:
Please note that the question asks which answer is NOT a differential diagnosis.
Toxic megacolon
This term, often ascribed loosely, is actually only attributable to cases where there is acute transmural colitis. Loss of motor tone leads to colonic dilatation to more than 5.5cm and widespread mucosal sloughing occurs. Consequentially there is loss of the normal mucosal pattern and haustration; this would usually be appreciated best on a barium study however can also be demonstrated on an abdominal radiograph or CT scan. A barium enema, or any other colorectal instrumentation, would be contra-indicated. The patient usually has severe bloody diarrhoea and is at significant risk of perforation. The condition carries a 20% mortality rate. The management varies according to aetiology. Surgical exploration should be used only if absolutely necessary for patients with inflammatory bowel disease; these patients are likely to require multiple abdominal surgeries throughout their life. Steroids, immunosuppressives and biologics should be used where possible.
Ulcerative colitis is the most common cause of toxic megacolon.
  Differential diagnoses of megacolon Â© Medical Exam Prep
  Distinguishing a toxic megacolon from a non-toxic megacolon is important as the management changes dramatically. Loss of haustration with thumbprinting and/or a known history of inflammatory bowel disease, or vasculopathy, or a positive stool culture are strong indicators that this may be a toxic megacolon.",False,"I chose 4. Ischaemic colitis as the answer because toxic megacolon is a severe form of colonic distention, usually caused by an inflammatory process, such as ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, or amoebiasis. Ischemic colitis, on the other hand, is caused by a lack of oxygen to the colon due to obstruction of the blood supply, and is not a differential diagnosis for toxic megacolon.",2,"This question falls under category 2: A question about clinical judgement, what is the correct diagnosis?",A,True,"I chose option 1, ""Ileus,"" because it is not a differential diagnosis for toxic megacolon. Toxic megacolon is a severe complication of inflammatory bowel diseases, such as ulcerative colitis (option 2) and Crohn's disease (option 3), as well as infectious colitis like amoebiasis (option 5) and ischemic colitis (option 4). These conditions can cause inflammation and damage to the colon, leading to its dilation.

On the other hand, ileus is a non-mechanical obstruction of the intestines. It is a functional disorder that results from a lack of coordinated peristalsis, which can be caused by various factors, such as surgery, electrolyte imbalances, or medications.

The PSA is usually considered elevated when levels exceed 4ng/L.

  The PSA density is calculated by taking the PSA and dividing it by the volume of the prostate. The volume is calculated as: Height x Length x Depth x Ï/6 (the volume of an ellipsoid). It accounts for the increase in size of the prostate which occurs in many men with increasing age and allows a far more comparable indication of the likelihood of malignancy. 0.1 is considered a normal PSA density value. Prostate cancers are usually seen in those with a prostate density of >0.1ng/ml/cc.
If a radiologist is reviewing a scan for a patient with a PSA density >0.1 and is unable to identify a prostatic malignancy then either they should review the scan more closely, or the PSA value could be repeated following appropriate instructions to the patient regarding cessation of PSA elevating activities prior to the test.",True,"NSAID use can cause a false PSA density because it can reduce the amount of PSA in the blood, resulting in a lower PSA density.

14536,201667,A 32-year-old man presents to his GP with troubling joint pains. He mentions suffering from food poisoning during his recent holiday abroad. On examination there is no rash and his HLA-B27 comes back as positive. His GP requests some x-rays which show bilateral asymmetrical sacroiliitis and paravertebral ossification. What is the most likely diagnosis? Select ONE answer only.,SBA: Musculoskeletal and Trauma,Reiter syndrome,Psoriatic arthropathy,Enteropathic arthropathy,Juvenile rheumatoid arthritis,Ankylosing spondylitis,A,40%,10%,37%,0%,14%,"Explanation:
Seronegative arthritides - These are negative for Rheumatoid factor but have a strong association with HLA-B27 positivity.
Ankylosing spondylitis - 95%
Enteropathic arthropathy - 90%
Psoriatic arthritis - 80%
Chronic reactive arthritis - 70%
  Chronic reactive arthritis (Reiter syndrome)
This disease is said to present as a triad of arthritis, conjunctivitis/uveitis and urethritis/cervicitis (Can't see, can't pee, can't climb a tree) however in reality only around a third of patients present with all three symptoms. Patients are usually aged 16-60 years. It has a reasonably strong male predominance but does occur in women. It can occur following infection with chlamydia, but also with gastrointestinal infections such as salmonella, shigella, campylobacter and yersinia. Most (>2/3rds) of patients are HLA-B27 positive.
Bilateral asymmetrical sacroiliitis
Paravertebral ossification - similar to syndesmophytes but in theory are seen separately from the disc, bridging around it. Most commonly in the thoracolumbar spine.
Enthesopathy - particularly at achilles tendon insertion, interspinous ligaments, and pelvic ligaments.
  Enteropathic arthropathy
This occurs in a subsect of patients with inflammatory or infective bowel disease. Roughly 10-20% of patients with Crohnâs or ulcerative colitis suffer from enteropathic arthropathy. Like chronic reactive arthropathy, it can also occur in the context of salmonella, shigella and yersinia infections. Appearances are very similar to those of ankylosing spondylitis; the two can be very difficult to separate radiologically.
Bilateral symmetrical sacroillitis
Enthesopathy
Vertebral syndesmophytes
Fusion of spinous processes
  Psoriatic arthropathy
Around a fifth of patients with psoriasis develop arthropathy and it is also possible to suffer from psoriatic arthropathy in the absence of the typical psoriatic cutaneous plaques. Around 80% of patients are HLA-B27 positive.
Importantly, on x-ray there are findings of both erosive changes in addition to productive changes with periosteal new bone formation. The combination of the two contrives to leave a âpencil-in-cupâ appearance. The joints can appear fluffy due to the exuberance of new bone formation.
The differential diagnosis for periosteal reactions in the presence of an arthropathy is relatively narrow and very specific:
Psoriatic arthropathy
Juvenile rheumatoid arthritis
Reiter syndrome
Infective arthropathy
  Although often classified as a distal arthropathy, preferring the DIPs to the MCPs, psoriatic arthropathy does also affect the spine and SI joints frequently. âSausage digitsâ is a term used to describe the diffuse soft tissue swelling which can affect the fingers and toes. Osteoporosis does occur but is a feature of later disease.
  Ankylosing spondylitis
This disease usually presents in early adulthood with gradual onset of back pain. There is a male preponderance, though it can affect women too. The vast majority (>90%) of patients are HLA-B27 positive. Radiologically the late features are classical with:
Bilateral symmetrical sacroiliitis
Enthesopathy - calcified tendon insertion sites
Bamboo spine - vertebral syndesmophytes, particularly in the thoracolumbar spine
Dagger sign - spinous process fusion
Erosion, then fusion at the symphysis pubis, costochondral, costovertebral and sternoclavicular joints
Thoracic manifestations: upper lobe pulmonary fibrosis, pericarditis, aortic root dilatation
  Early features are far more subtle and require a higher index of suspicion.
Enthesopathy - high signal on MRI at tendon insertion sites
Romanus lesions - triangular shaped oedema at the corners of vertebral bodies
Andersson lesions - bony oedema in the vertebral bodies adjacent to the disks.
Oedema in the sacroiliac joints.
  Patients with advanced ankylosing spondylitis are at increased risk of pathological fractures due to fusion. These can be pelvic fractures following a simple fall, or chance fractures of the spine (involving all three columns - in ankylosing spondylitis, these fractures are also sometimes termed chalk-stick or carrot fractures).
  Juvenile idiopathic arthritis
This condition used to be termed juvenile rheumatoid arthritis. It is a cluster of similar conditions affecting patients under the age of 16.
The affected joints show:
Effusions
Erosions
Cartilage destruction
  Epiphyseal overgrowth secondary to reactive hyperaemia occurs owing to the immature nature of the skeleton. Premature physeal closure can result in limb length discrepancies in adulthood.
Large joints are typically affected first and the small joints of the hands and feet are affected later on.

14273,201667,You are performing a contrast enhanced ultrasound scan on a patient. There is a 3cm lesion in the left lobe of the liver. Which of the following is correctly matched with its likely diagnosis? Select ONE answer only.,SBA: Gastrointestinal,Immediate uniform enhancement which washes out - malignant lesion,Peripheral nodular enhancement with gradual filling in - flash haemangioma,Spoke wheel enhancement of a central scar - fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma,Gradual uniform enhancement - haemangioma,Arterial enhancement with a non-enhancing central scar - focal nodular hyperplasia,A,66%,7%,5%,8%,14%,"Explanation:
The correct pairings are as follows:
Immediate uniform enhancement which washes out - malignant lesion
Peripheral nodular enhancement with gradual filling in - haemangioma
Spoke wheel enhancement of a central scar - focal nodular hyperplasia
Gradual uniform enhancement - benign lesion
Arterial enhancement with a non-enhancing central scar - fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma
  Contrast enhanced ultrasound (CEUS)
CEUS is cheaper than MRI and confers less risk to the patient. The patient is injected with a contrast agent consisting of tiny microbubbles measuring micrometers in diameter. These circulate within the patient and when insonated cause strong reflections which show up as hyperechogenicity in real time as the bubbles wash in and out of the field of view. The microbubbles burst in time and the process can be repeated within a few minutes if required. There is no renal toxicity and adverse reactions are very rare meaning this is a safe procedure for almost all patients. The most significant limitation is the location of the lesion; if the lesion cannot be seen with B-mode ultrasound then it cannot be interrogated with CEUS.
It is a useful technique particularly for differentiating between malignant lesions (which tend to washout rapidly owing to their high vascularity), and benign lesions but is also useful for characterising benign lesions such as haemangiomata or focal nodular hyperplasia by demonstrating the same enhancement patterns which would otherwise be expected on an MRI.
The technique, having been developed with liver lesions in mind, is now being expanded to renal lesions, testicular masses and vascular work too, among others.
As a general rule, if the lesion can be seen on ultrasound, it can be investigated with CEUS however lesions smaller than 10mm are often challenging in this regard. In any case, an anechoic lesion (i.e. a cyst) needs no further investigation. Lesions close to the diaphragm (Segments VII and VIII in particular) are difficult to see with ultrasound at the best of times.",False,"I chose number 4 because haemangiomas typically demonstrate gradual uniform enhancement, with peripheral nodular enhancement and gradual filling in.

Select ONE answer only.,SBA: Central Nervous and Head & Neck,I-123 Ioflupane DAT,18F-FDG PET,Tc99m - HMPAO SPECT,MRI with contrast,CT pre and post contrast,A,72%,11%,13%,3%,0%,"Explanation:
Parkinson's disease
Generalised cerebral atrophy occurs with Parkinson's disease but is a highly non-specific feature. There are, however, radiological findings in the midbrain which although subtle, are far more specific. Parkinson's disease occurs when there is neuronal loss in the substantia nigra, specifically the pars compacta of the substantia nigra. On a T2 weighted MRI image this appears as blurring of the intermediate signal intensity line which separates the two adjacent low intensity structures (these are the pars reticulata of the substantia nigra and the red nucleus).
A DAT scan (Dopamine Active Transfer) can be performed to confirm the diagnosis. This uses the radiopharmaceutical I-123 Ioflupane to image dopamine transporters in the brain. These are present in the highest concentrations in the putamina and caudate nuclei. In patients with true Parkinson's disease (as opposed to other similar conditions), there will be loss of uptake in the posterior putamen. This can be an asymmetric finding. Colloquially speaking the appearance of these areas on a normal patient resembles a comma and on a patient with Parkinson's disease they become more like full stops.

DeQuervain thyroiditis is a lymphocytic infiltration of the thyroid with a likely viral aetiology. Nuclear medicine scanning usually shows diffuse low uptake.",False,"I chose Graves disease because it is the most common cause of thyrotoxicosis, and it often presents with diffusely low uptake on a nuclear medicine scan.

DeQuervain thyroiditis, also known as subacute thyroiditis or granulomatous thyroiditis, is an inflammatory thyroid disorder that often follows a viral respiratory infection. This matches the patient's recent history of having a respiratory infection in the past few weeks.

Additionally, the nuclear medicine scan showed diffusely low uptake, which is a characteristic finding in DeQuervain thyroiditis. In this condition, the inflammation of the thyroid gland leads to a transient release of thyroid hormones, causing thyrotoxicosis (high levels of thyroid hormones in the blood). However, the damaged thyroid gland is unable to take up the radioactive iodine used in the nuclear medicine scan, leading to the observed low uptake.

In contrast, Graves' disease and Hashimoto thyroiditis typically present with diffuse high uptake and patchy uptake, respectively, on nuclear medicine scans.

13834,205045,"A 45-year-old lady presents with shortness of breath. Her chest radiograph demonstrates features consistent with pulmonary hypertension. She undergoes an echocardiogram and subsequent cardiac MRI scan which demonstrates bi-atrial dilatation with a normal ventricular size. On the black blood sequences, the radiographer mentions they are having difficulty suppressing the myocardium. What is the most likely underlying diagnosis?",SBA: Cardiothoracic and vascular,Amyloid,TB,Eosinophilic cardiomyopathy,Sarcoidosis,Atrial fibrillation,A,75%,1%,10%,8%,6%,"Explanation:
Amyloid
This is the most common cause of restrictive cardiomyopathy. There is often diffuse subendocardial delayed gadolinium enhancement; this is a classic feature. Cardiac MRI studies on patients with amyloid cardiomyopathy can often be technically very challenging to perform.
  A small amount of physics for imaging of patients with cardiac amyloidosis
Amyloid deposition leads to fibrosis and, as a general rule, fibrotic processes contain little water. On MRI scans therefore, most fibrotic entities return little signal on any sequence. Additionally, in many patients with amyloid cardiomyopathy, gadolinium washes out of the myocardium far faster than normally occurs. Both these features combine to the extent that the blood within the heart becomes very dark (due to higher than usual concentrations of gadolinium washed out from the myocardium) but at the same time the signal from the myocardium is very low due to the presence of fibrosis. Nulling the signal from the myocardium (to try to better visualise the affected areas of myocardium) therefore becomes difficult since the null point for both the blood pool and the myocardium is almost the same.
  Loefflerâs syndrome (eosinophilic cardiomyopathy)
Biventricular ventricular thrombus with endocardial fibrosis is a classical description of this condition. It can cause both a restrictive cardiomyopathy and valvular pathology. Elevation of serum eosinophil levels is another feature.
  TB
TB can affect the pericardium and result in constrictive cardiomyopathy. It can also affect the myocardium and give a nodular appearance to the myocardium on T1.
  Sarcoidosis
This usually causes nodular midwall late gadolinium enhancement, particularly affecting the base of the septum.
  Atrial Fibrillation
This can cause biatrial dilatation, but is not associated with the other features.",False,"I chose number 2 because eosinophilic cardiomyopathy is a rare disorder characterized by an accumulation of eosinophils in the heart muscle, which can lead to myocardial dysfunction and difficulty suppressing the myocardium on black blood sequences. It is also associated with bi-atrial dilatation and normal ventricular size, which were both seen on the patient's cardiac MRI scan.",2,,C,True,"I chose option 3, amyloid, because the given information in the scenario is consistent with the features of cardiac amyloidosis. The presence of bi-atrial dilatation with normal ventricular size suggests that there is an infiltrative process affecting the myocardium, leading to restrictive filling and increased atrial pressures. 

Additionally, the difficulty in suppressing the myocardium on black blood sequences during the cardiac MRI is a common finding in amyloidosis due to the infiltration of amyloid proteins in the myocardium, which alters the signal characteristics of the tissue. This makes it challenging to differentiate between the myocardium and the blood pool, resulting in poor suppression of the myocardial signal.

A Meckelâs diverticulum is a vestigial remnant of the vitellointestinal duct. It is the commonest malformation of the gastrointestinal tract, being present in around 2% of the population. They are twice as common in men than women.
When present a Meckelâs diverticulum is located in the distal ileum, usually within 60-100 cm (2 feet) of the ileocaecal valve. They are usually 3-6 cm (approx. 2 inches) long and may have a greater lumen than that of the ileum.
They are commonly found as an incidental finding, particularly at appendicectomy. The majority are asymptomaticbut they can present with the following complications:
Haemorrhage (25-50% of complications)
Intestinal obstruction (10-40% of complications)
Diverticulitis
Perforation
  Meckelâs diverticula run antimesenterically but receive their blood supply from the mesentery of the ileum, and a typical feeding vessel called the vitelline artery can be identified. They are typically lined with ileal mucosa but frequently contain ectopic mucosa, the two commonest types being gastric (50%) and pancreatic (5%). More rarely colonic or jejunal mucosa may be present.
The ârule of 2sâ is a useful aide-mÃ©moire

Stromal tumour also known as GIST (Gastrointestinal stromal tumour)
Particularly when of low staging at resection, these tumours carry an excellent prognosis. Unfortunately around half of patients present with metastatic disease owing to the relatively indolent nature of the primary lesion. Tumour histology is used to guide follow up and newer antibody therapies have also improved outcomes significantly.
70% of GISTs occur in the stomach with most of the remainder being found in the small bowel. Clinical presentation varies slightly with the exact location but dysphagia and early satiety are common, as are sequelae from mucosal ulceration and bleeding. They can occur as a feature of neurofibromatosis type 1 and are also discussed in connection to the Carney triad (Not to be confused with Carney syndrome). On imaging they may be occult or appear as a well-circumscribed submucosal mass. The low attenuation is attributable to central necrosis within the mass. Characteristically however they tend to enlarge extraluminally into the lesser sac, gastrosplenic or gastrohepatic ligaments. Of note, lymph node enlargement is specifically not a feature and an alternative diagnosis should be sought if lymph node enlargement is present.

You are reviewing her MRI scan and suspect that she has a diagnosis of carpal tunnel syndrome. Which SINGLE statement regarding the carpal tunnel is true?",SBA: Musculoskeletal and Trauma,The tendon of flexor pollicis longus is surrounded by its own synovial sheath,The extensor retinaculum forms the floor of the tunnel,The ulnar artery passes deep to the tunnel,It lies on the dorsal side of the wrist,It contains three flexor tendons,A,80%,4%,5%,2%,9%,"Explanation:
The carpal tunnel is a passageway on the palmar side of the wrist that connects the forearm to the middle compartment of the deep plane of the hand.
The carpal tunnel is formed by two layers, the carpal arch and the flexor retinaculum:
1. The carpal arch forms the floor of the carpal tunnel. It is concave on the palmar side and is formed laterally by the scaphoid and trapezium tubercles and medially by the hook of the hamate and the pisiform bones.
2. The flexor retinaculum forms the roof of the carpal tunnel. It is a strong, fibrous band that covers the carpal bones on the palmar side of the hand near the wrist. It is attached medially to the pisiform bone and the hook of the hamate bone. Laterally it attaches to the tubercle of the scaphoid bone, and to the medial part of the trapezium bone.
The carpal tunnel contains a total of nine flexor tendons (but not the muscles themselves), surrounded by a synovial sheath, and the median nerve. The tendons contained within the carpal tunnel are:
Flexor digitorum profundus (four tendons)
Flexor digitorum superficialis (four tendons)
Flexor pollicis longus (one tendon)
  The eight tendons of the flexor digitorum profundus and superficialis are surrounded by a single synovial sheath, whereas the tendon of flexor pollicis longus is surrounded by its own synovial sheath. These sheaths allow free movement of the tendons
The tendon of flexor carpi radialis does not pass through the carpal tunnel, but is instead located within the flexor retinaculum itself.
The ulnar artery and ulnar nerve pass superficial to the flexor retinaculum and the carpal tunnel, passing through the ulnar tunnel.
Carpal tunnel syndrome is an entrapment neuropathy of the median nerve. It causes weakness and parasthesia in the distribution of the median nerve. The muscles innervated by the median nerve can be remembered using the mnemonic âLOAFâ:
L â lateral two lumbricals
O â Opponens pollicis
A â Abductor pollicis
F â Flexor pollicis brevis

Film rotation
Unfortunately it is more likely that technical features will cause unilateral hyperlucency than any of the pathological conditions which may feature in the differential diagnosis. Rotation of the patient to the right on a PA film will bring the right hemithorax away from the plate. The chest anatomy is such that in doing so the xray beam travels through less lung tissue in terms of depth than either the contralateral side in the same rotated patient or the right lung in an unrotated patient. The beam travelling through less lung tissue is therefore less attenuated and the lung appears hyperlucent on the resultant film
  Poland syndrome
Poland syndrome is a rare cause of a hyperlucent hemithorax on a CXR. There is hypoplasia or even aplasia of the chest wall musculature plus/minus breast. Abnormalities of the fingers on the same side such as syndactyly (fusion) or brachydactyly (shortening) can also occur and the ipsilateral ribs may also be abnormal.
  Swyer-James syndrome
In this condition, normal development of the infant lung is impeded by bronchiolitis (viral or mycoplasma) at an early age, with superadded acute airspace destruction. Consequently the affected lobe is small and lucent on the CXR due to air trapping. It is a differential diagnosis for a unilateral lucent hemithorax, along with a pneumothorax, very large pulmonary emboli and causes of decreased chest wall musculature such as Poland syndrome or, historically, polio. In an an exam situation In an an exam situation Swyer-James syndrome is usually given as a teenage or young adult patient with a history of recurrent LRTIs. Air trapping, and bronchiectasis can also be described.
  Alpha 1 antitrypsin deficiency
Alpha-1 antitrypsin is a glycoprotein which is made in the liver and secreted. One of its functions in the lungs is to oppose the action of proteolytic enzymes the likes of which are secreted by white blood cells in order to counter sub-clinical bacterial infections. Since A1AT is deficient in these patients the unopposed action of the enzymes goes beyond the intended destruction of pathogenic bacteria and causes damage to the lung tissue. Patients are usually diagnosed in early adulthood when their symptoms develop. On CT there is panacinar emphysema, particularly affecting the bases. Bronchiectasis is also often seen. Cirrhosis is another feature of this disease and should be looked for on imaging. ",True,I chose 4. Rotation to the right because it is the most common cause of an incidental hyperlucent right lung in an 18-year-old woman. This is due to the fact that the heart and lungs are in constant motion and the right lung is more likely to be displaced to the right due to the larger size of the left lung and the shape of the chest cavity. This displacement can cause the right lung to appear hyperlucent on imaging.,1,"3. A question about medical ethics.

13909,205045,A 70-year-old man develops worsening conductive hearing loss which does not improve following ear syringing. He undergoes a CT scan and this shows non-dependant soft tissue density within the left middle ear. In addition the malleus and incus cannot be identified. What is the most likely diagnosis? Select ONE answer only.,SBA: Central Nervous and Head & Neck,Pars tensa cholesteatoma,Pars flaccida cholesteatoma,Cholesterol granuloma,Otitis media,Aberrant internal carotid artery,A,49%,45%,3%,1%,1%,"Explanation:
Cholesteatoma
Cholesteatomas (Acquired or congenital) are histolologically epidermoid cysts. On imaging the finding of non-dependant soft tissue and bony erosion within the middle ear is typical for a cholesteatoma.
There are two types of acquired cholesteatoma:
Pars flaccida (80%) â classically erodes the scutum and extends superiorly
Pars tensa (20%) â classically erodes the ossicles, extending medially
These refer to the two parts of the tympanic membrane from which they arise. There is a lot of overlap between the appearances of these two types; both can and do erode the ossicles. Absence of ossicular erosion is by no means specific for a pars flaccida cholesteatoma.
Image Â© Medical Exam Prep
  In due course, if left unattended, a cholesteatoma will expand to fill the entire middle ear. Prior to this point they can be seen as non-dependant soft tissue within the middle ear. Dependant soft tissue within the middle ear suggests the presence of fluid or pus and the diagnosis of a middle ear infection. Once a cholesteatoma has filled the middle ear completely however no gas remains from which to discern dependency.
There are a number of theories as to how cholesteatomas arise. One theory is that following a perforation of the tympanic membrane entry of desquamated stratified keratinised squamous epithelium from the external auditory canal into the middle ear is permitted. There it adheres to the tympanic membrane and proliferates unrelentingly causing a soft tissue mass to form and eventually leading to bony erosion of the ossicles, scutum and/or other parts of the middle ear.
A congenital cholesteatoma behaves in a similar manner but is present from birth due to an aberrant location of a tiny island of keratinised squamous epithelium.
Cholesteatomas are difficult to manage as they have a high recurrence rate. Imaging has a significant role to play in the management of recurrent cholesteatomas; distinguishing recurrence from post-operative granulation tissue or fluid is important.
  Diagnosis Restricts Diffusion Enhances
Recurrent cholesteatoma Yes No
Granulation tissue No Yes
Fluid No No
  Post-contrast sequences for recurrent cholesteatomas require a delay of around 45 minutes from giving the contrast to acquiring images as the granulation tissue is slow to take up contrast. This has obvious down-sides to any modern day busy MRI schedule. However since the management of post-operative granulation tissue and post-operative fluid is largely identical, namely expectant, it is not important to differentiate the one from the other. Thus findings on diffusion weighted sequences are the most important thing in post-operative cholesteatoma imaging.
  Cholesterol granuloma
A cholesterol granuloma occurs as a sequela of recurrent bouts of otitis media. Haemorrhage within the middle ear leads to the formation of granulation tissue. On imaging this is seen as non-specification of the middle ear on CT. Bony changes can occur chronically with bony expansion, or displacement and even destruction of the ossicles. The signals characteristics on MRI are therefore important to distinguish it from a cholesteatoma. Whereas a cholesteatoma on MRI is isointense to brain parenchyma on T1, a cholesterol granuloma will show high signal in the middle ear on T1 due to the paramagnetic effects of methaemoglobin. On clinical examination the ENT surgeon may report a bulging blue tympanic membrane. This is classical. Dehiscence of the jugular bulb is an important differential diagnosis to exclude as this will also give a blue tympanic membrane on examination but the management is radically different!
  Aberrant internal carotid artery
An aberrant internal carotid artery can cause a pulsatile mass in the middle ear. The question usually asked on this topic is slightly different and to do with the persistent stapedial artery and consequential aplastic foramen spinosum (anatomically â âthe heel of the high-heeled shoeâ). The stapedial artery in such cases arises from the internal carotid artery and runs through the stapes, becoming the middle meningeal artery (which usually arises from the external carotid artery and courses through the foramen spinosum).",True,"The CT scan findings of non-dependent soft tissue density within the left middle ear, and the inability to identify the malleus and incus, are consistent with a diagnosis of pars tensa cholesteatoma. Pars tensa cholesteatoma is a benign, slowly progressive, destructive lesion of the middle ear and mastoid that can cause conductive hearing loss. It is caused by the accumulation of keratin debris in the middle ear and may be associated with chronic otitis media.",2,,A,False,"I chose option 1, Pars flaccida cholesteatoma, as the most likely diagnosis based on the patient's symptoms and the CT scan findings. 

A cholesteatoma is an abnormal growth of skin cells in the middle ear, which can lead to hearing loss and other complications. There are two types: Pars flaccida cholesteatoma and Pars tensa cholesteatoma. 

In this case, the patient has worsening conductive hearing loss, and the CT scan shows non-dependant soft tissue density within the left middle ear, along with the absence of the malleus and incus bones. These findings are consistent with a cholesteatoma, as it can cause erosion of the ossicles (malleus and incus) and accumulate as a soft tissue mass in the middle ear.

Pars flaccida cholesteatoma is more likely in this case because it typically involves the superior part of the middle ear and can lead to the erosion of the ossicles, as seen in the CT scan. Pars tensa cholesteatoma usually involves the inferior part of the middle ear and is less likely to cause ossicular erosion.

The other options are less likely because:

2. Cholesterol granuloma usually presents as a cystic lesion in the petrous apex, not as a soft tissue mass in the middle ear.
3. Otitis media typically presents with signs of infection, such as fever and ear pain, which are not mentioned in this case.

The lesion is situated in the lateral limb of the left adrenal gland and is 2cm in diameter. It measures 12HU on the unenhanced sequence, 38HU on the portal venous phase and 21HU on the delayed sequences. You may use a calculator. What is the absolute washout of this lesion?","SBA: Genito urinary, Adrenal, Obstetrics & Gynaecology and Breast",65%,45%,35%,68%,43%,A,77%,7%,6%,7%,4%,"Explanation:
Figures have been rounded to the nearest whole number.
Absolute washout = (38-21)/(38-12) = 65%
Relative washout = (38-21)/38 = 45%
    This lesion is a benign adrenal adenoma. In many centres, if the lesion measures less than 10HU on the unenhanced sequence then the study will be terminated at that point.
  Adrenal washout
Washout characteristics of adrenal nodules help confirm or refute a diagnosis of an adrenal adenoma. The absolute washout takes into account the initial uptake of contrast whereas the relative washout calculation is based only on how well contrast washes out of a nodule.
The underpinning principle is that vasculature within malignant lesions is more permeable than in benign lesions. This allows contrast to diffuse out of the lesion during the portal venous phase and the contrast is then slower to wash out during the delayed phase than it would be for benign lesions. Thus the higher/faster washout characteristics (either absolute or relative) the more suggestive it is that a lesion is benign.
    Adrenal adenoma
These present a diagnostic challenge if only to rule out a malignant adrenal mass. Once the diagnosis is confirmed they can then be left alone and do not require any further imaging. The majority are obvious on CT and obviously adenomas. Owing to their high fat content most adenomas show low Hounsfield units (HU) an HU <18 on an unenhanced study has a sensitivity of 85% and a specificity of 100%.
In cases where the fat content is insufficient to make the diagnosis an adrenal protocol CT can be performed. This compares the HU on an unenhanced scan, a portal venous phase scan and a 15 minute delayed phase scan. From these values the absolute washout can be calculated by comparing the difference between the two contrast studies with the amount of contrast taken up in the first place (i.e. the difference between the portal venous phase and the unenhanced phase). The relative washout is calculated by comparing the difference between the two contrast studies to just the portal venous phase (i.e. it is relative to the portal venous phase).
An alternative diagnostic strategy which, but for demand management, is better for patients as far as dose preservation is concerned, is an MRI scan. The fat content of adrenal adenomas shows up well as signal loss on out-of-phase imaging and gives a chemical shift artefact in the frequency encoding direction on both gradient echo and spin echo sequences.  On gradient echo sequences due to the chemical shift a black line appears in all directions and is termed the India Ink effect or etching artefact.
  Diagnostic of adrenal adenoma:
At least 60% absolute washout
At least 40% relative washout
<18 HU (100% specific)
<37 HU on a delayed scan
India ink effect on GE MRI
Chemical shift on GE and SE MRI",False,"The absolute washout of this lesion is calculated by subtracting the attenuation of the delayed phase from the attenuation of the unenhanced phase, and then dividing that result by the attenuation of the unenhanced phase. In this case, 12-21=-9, and then -9/12=-0.75. This is equivalent to 35%.",1,"3. A question about the application of knowledge, how to interpret a scan?

This question falls under category 3: A question about the application of knowledge, how to interpret a scan.",C,True,"I chose option 1 (65%) because it is the closest value to the calculated absolute washout percentage for the adrenal lesion. The absolute washout percentage is a useful parameter in differentiating between benign and malignant adrenal lesions. It is calculated using the Hounsfield Units (HU) from the unenhanced, enhanced (portal venous phase), and delayed sequences of a CT scan.

In this case, the formula for absolute washout is:

Absolute washout = [(Enhanced HU - Delayed HU) / (Enhanced HU - Unenhanced HU)] x 100

Select ONE answer only.,SBA: Gastrointestinal,Repeat interval AXR,Colonoscopy,Barium enema,Bowel resection,CT colonoscopy,A,59%,4%,2%,21%,14%,"Explanation:
Toxic megacolon
This term, often ascribed loosely, is actually only attributable to cases where there is acute transmural colitis. Loss of motor tone leads to colonic dilatation to more than 5.5cm and widespread mucosal sloughing occurs. Consequentially there is loss of the normal mucosal pattern and haustration; this would usually be appreciated best on a barium study however can also be demonstrated on an abdominal radiograph or CT scan. A barium enema, or any other colorectal instrumentation, would be contra-indicated. The patient usually has severe bloody diarrhoea and is at significant risk of perforation. The condition carries a 20% mortality rate. The management varies according to aetiology. Surgical exploration should be used only if absolutely necessary for patients with inflammatory bowel disease; these patients are likely to require multiple abdominal surgeries throughout their life. Steroids, immunosuppressives and biologics should be used where possible.
Ulcerative colitis is the most common cause of toxic megacolon.
  Differential diagnoses of megacolon Â© Medical Exam Prep
  Distinguishing a toxic megacolon from a non-toxic megacolon is important as the management changes dramatically. Loss of haustration with thumbprinting and/or a known history of inflammatory bowel disease, or vasculopathy, or a positive stool culture are strong indicators that this may be a toxic megacolon.
Ulcerative colitis
Whereas Crohn's disease causes discontinuous transmural inflammation in ulcerative colitis it is a continuous segment of bowel which is affected beginning at the rectum and progressing proximally. Additionally, it is only the mucosa and submucosa which are affected. Patients present with symptoms of abdominal pain, bloody diarrhoea and experience relapses and periods of remission with the disease. In general, the small bowel is spared with the exception of the terminal ileum which can be affected in a so-called âbackwash ileitisâ manner. On imaging colonic mucosal hyperenhancement can sometimes be seen, along with mucosal oedema (so-called thumbprinting). On fluoroscopic studies pseudopolyps can be seen â these are actually islands of normal mucosa or granulation tissue surrounded on all sides by inflammation. In the chronic phase the colon may become narrower, smooth and featureless as the haustral markings are lost. This is described as a lead-pipe appearance.",False,"Colonoscopy is the best next step in the management of this patient because it will allow the physician to directly visualize the inside of the patient's colon and identify the cause of the symptoms. Additionally, a colonoscopy can be used to take biopsies of any suspicious lesions and perform therapeutic interventions, such as polypectomy, if necessary.",2,"3.

11526,205045,A GP practice nurse visits an 86-year-old poorly controlled diabetic Indian gentleman at his home. When she arrives he is clearly unwell; feverish and complaining of right upper quadrant pain. While she is visiting he experiences a rigor. She sends him to A&E where he undergoes an abdominal x-ray. This shows gas bubbles in the right hypochondrium. An ultrasound shows intrarenal and perirenal hyperechoic stranding. What is the most likely diagnosis?,"SBA: Genito urinary, Adrenal, Obstetrics & Gynaecology and Breast",Emphysematous pyelonephritis,Xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis,Tuberculosis,Malakoplakia,Leukoplakia,A,95%,4%,1%,0%,0%,"Explanation:
Emphysematous Pyelonephritis
The radiological appearances of this condition are very striking, particularly on CT where streaky or lobulated gas can be seen in the renal parenchyma and perirenal tissues. On ultrasound the gas causes ring-down artefacts and is sometime described as giving a âdirty shadowingâ appearance. It is a very important diagnosis to make since it comes with significant morbidity. E-coli is the usual culprit and a history of poorly controlled diabetes is usual. The main differential diagnoses is the far less severe condition of emphysematous pyelitis where e-coli infection is confined to the excretory system and responds well to antibiotic therapy, and the presence of a fistulous connection to the bowel.
  Malakoplakia
Directly translated from Greek, malakoplakia just means soft plaques. These are actually submucosal inflammatory plaques consisting of basophilic PAS positive inclusion bodies and incompletely destroyed e-coli bacteria. The giveaway pathological term is Michaelis-Gutmann inclusion bodies which are the incompletely destroyed e-coli bacteria surrounded by a lipoprotein membrane. Although malakoplakia can occur in anyone, patients with diabetes mellitus or immunosuppression are predisposed to it. Importantly though, it is not a pre-malignant condition unlike leukoplakia. On imaging there are filling defects in the bladder and distal ureters. These are usually small, measuring only a few millimetres across.
  Xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis (XGP)
This curious condition results from chronic pyelonephritis and leads to a non-functioning kidney. Chronic infection (most commonly with Proteus or e-coli) induces a granulomatous process whereby the renal tissue eventually becomes replaced by a mass of reactive tissue. Since proteus infection is one of the main causes it is not surprising that many cases present with a staghorn calculus. The exact association varies from 30-90% depending on the data source. The other finding on CT is of multiple low attenuation rounded areas with Hounsfield Units (HU) of around -15 to -20. These are the dilated calyces filled with debris and xanthoma collections and they cause the whole kidney to be enlarged. The appearance is said to resemble a bearâs paw. Patients can present either on a background of recurrent UTIs or potentially renal colic. Vague malaise and weight loss may be the presentation in the absence of direct urinary symptoms.
  Renal tuberculosis
In areas of the world endemic to tuberculosis, renal tuberculosis is a reasonably common presentation of extra-pulmonary disease. The appearances on imaging vary depending on the disease timeline. The classical âputty kidneyâ of renal tuberculosis is an end-stage appearance where there is dystrophic calcification affecting all parts of the kidney. At this point the kidney has usually become shrunken and small and the final appearance is of so-called autonephrectomy when there is essentially no parenchymal tissue left, just amorphous calcification. An earlier manifestation is stenosis to the infundibuli connecting the calyces to the renal pelvis causing proximal dilatation of the calyces which are seen to be clubbed on a urogram. Purportedly, the earliest sign is of moth-eaten calyces owing to uneven erosion to the papillae.
  Leukoplakia 
Directly translated from Greek, leukoplakia just means white plaques. It is a squamous metaplastic condition affecting the transitional cell epithelium of the bladder. Presentation is usually as a consequence either of recurrent urinary tract infections or urinary tract calculi. Sometimes patients complain of passing flaky white tissue in the urine which is pathognomonic for this condition. On imaging there is mucosal thickening and filling defects within the bladder. Some sources consider leukoplakia to be a premalignant condition for epidermoid carcinoma.",False,"Xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis is the most likely diagnosis because it is the most common cause of gas bubbles in the right hypochondrium and intrarenal and perirenal hyperechoic stranding. This condition is typically seen in elderly patients, especially those with poorly controlled diabetes, and is characterized by fever, abdominal pain, and rigors.",2,,B,True,"I chose Emphysematous pyelonephritis as the most likely diagnosis because the given clinical presentation and imaging findings are consistent with this condition. 

Emphysematous pyelonephritis (EPN) is a severe, necrotizing infection of the renal parenchyma and surrounding tissues, characterized by the presence of gas within the renal parenchyma, collecting system, or perirenal space. It is more commonly seen in patients with poorly controlled diabetes, like the 86-year-old gentleman in the scenario.

The clinical presentation of fever, right upper quadrant pain, and rigor suggests an acute infection. The abdominal x-ray showing gas bubbles in the right hypochondrium and the ultrasound findings of intrarenal and perirenal hyperechoic stranding further support the diagnosis of EPN. These imaging findings are indicative of gas formation within the kidney and surrounding tissues, which is a characteristic feature of EPN.

The other options, such as Xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis, Tuberculosis, Malakoplakia, and Leukoplakia, may present with similar symptoms, but the presence of gas in the renal region is more specific to Emphysematous pyelonephritis.",A,True,A,True,"[{""page_content"": ""erable due to co-morbidity.

14512,205045,A 54-year-old man collapses while playing golf. On arrival at the Emergency Department the blood pressure in his arms is found to be different.

Which of the following is NOT a possible cause of subclavian steal syndrome? Select ONE answer only.,SBA: Central Nervous and Head & Neck,Poland syndrome,Atherosclerosis,Takayasu aortitis,Thoracic aortic dissection,Cervical rib,A,87%,2%,3%,5%,4%,"Explanation:
Please note that the question asks which answer is NOT a possible cause.
  Subclavian steal syndrome occurs when blood supplying the arm (usually the left arm) travels via the ipsilateral vertebral artery in order to bypass a proximal obstruction of the subclavian artery. The distal subclavian artery âstealsâ blood from the vertebral artery circulation. This gives rise to two different categories of symptoms:
Arm - weaker pulses, numbness, paraesthesia, fingertip necrosis
Brain - syncope, ischaemic symptoms
  The most likely cause of subclavian steal would be atherosclerosis. Takayasu aortitis and aortic dissections can also cause subclavian steal but would not be at the top of a differential list without further prompts from the history. A cervical rib can also cause subclavian steal syndrome via stenosis, intimal damage and consequent thrombosis.
  Poland syndrome
This is a congenital condition where there is hypoplasia or aplasia of the pectoralis major muscle on one side in association with abnormalities in the ipsilateral hand such as syndactyly, and hypoplasia of the middle phalanx. The absence of the large pectoralis major muscle is seen on a chest radiograph as abnormal hyperlucency on the affected side.",False,"I chose 3 because Takayasu aortitis is not a possible cause of subclavian steal syndrome. Subclavian steal syndrome is a condition caused by a narrowing or obstruction of the subclavian artery, which can lead to a decrease in blood flow to the brain. It can be caused by atherosclerosis, Poland syndrome, thoracic aortic dissection, or a cervical rib. Takayasu aortitis is an inflammatory condition of the aorta and its branches, but is not thought to cause subclavian steal syndrome.",1,"3. A question about the interpretation of results, what do the results mean?

Option 3. A question about the interpretation of results, what do the results mean?",C,True,"I chose option 4 (Poland syndrome) because it is not a possible cause of subclavian steal syndrome. Poland syndrome is a congenital condition characterized by the absence or underdevelopment of chest wall muscles and sometimes webbing of the fingers on one side of the body. It does not involve the blood vessels and therefore does not cause subclavian steal syndrome, which is a condition where blood flow is reversed in the vertebral artery due to a blockage in the subclavian artery.

The epididymis is a tube that connects the testis to the vas deferens. It is responsible for the transport and storage of sperm cells produced in the testes.
The epididymis can be divided into three main regions:
The head, which is the most proximal portion and is formed by the efferent tubules of the testes, which transport sperm from the testes to the epididymis
The body, which is the middle portion and is formed by the heavily coiled duct of the epididymis
The tail, which is the most distal portion and marks the origin of the vas deferens, which transports sperm to the urethra for ejaculation
  The epididymis receives its innervation from the spermatic plexus (also referred to as the testicular plexus), a network of nerves derived from the renal plexus that receives branches from the aortic plexus.
The epididymis shares a common blood supply with the testis. They receive their arterial supply from the paired testicular arteries, which are direct branches from the abdominal aorta. They descend into the abdomen and pass into the scrotum via the inguinal canal, contained within the spermatic cord.
  The testis and epididymis (from Grayâs Anatomy)
 ",False,"I chose this answer because it is the only one that is true. The epididymis is a long, coiled tube located at the back of the testicles that is responsible for the production and storage of sperm. It is also responsible for the transport of sperm from the testes to the vas deferens.",1,"1.

The epididymis is indeed innervated by the testicular plexus, which is a network of nerves derived from the renal, aortic, and lumbar plexuses.

The other options are incorrect for the following reasons:
1. The epididymis consists of three main regions: the head, body, and tail.

14134,205045,A 72-year-old man is undergoing pre-operative assessment prior to a routine TURP procedure for some troublesome lower urinary tract symptoms. When his PSA is found to be markedly elevated he undergoes an MRI scan for further investigation.  Which of the following regarding prostate cancer in the transitional zone is correct? Select ONE answer only.,"SBA: Genito urinary, Adrenal, Obstetrics & Gynaecology and Breast",Around 30% of prostate cancers occur in the transitional zone,They can be easily distinguished from BPH changes,They often have extraprostatic disease at presentation,A negative trans-rectal biopsy is reassuring,A non-circumscribed low T2 lesion is most likely to be BPH,A,83%,2%,7%,3%,5%,"Explanation:
Transitional zone cancers are less common than peripheral zone cancers but do occur and account for around 30% of prostate cancers. They are often harder to detect clinically due to their central location, and can be occult on imaging owing to overlap and confusion, in particular in patients with benign prostatic hypertrophy since it is the transitional zone which is involved in BPH. BPH leads to a heterogenous and enlarged appearance to the transitional zone which can obscure smaller lesions. On the plus side however, they are more often organ-confined since their central location effectively cushions them from capsular breach for longer. Their central location within the prostate cancer does however mean that trans-rectal biopsies may be falsely reassuring if negative, having missed the lesion due to lesion-depth within the prostate. Clinicians should have a low threshold for repeat-biopsies.
Peripheral zone
The highest grade of suspicion for malignancy in the peripheral zone is indicated by the presence of marked restricted diffusion (focal high b-value and corresponding low ADC signal), with a PIRADS 5 lesion being one that is greater than 1.5 cm. PIRADS 3 lesions will show some restricted diffusion but this is far less (subjective analysis) than for PIRADS 4 lesions. Dynamic contrast enhancement is used for assessment of peripheral zone lesions only - differentiating between lesions which show only limited restricted diffusion. If there is dynamic contrast enhancement with a type 3 washout curve, the lesion becomes a PIRADS 4 lesion despite the only limited restriction in diffusion.
Transitional zone
The highest grade of suspicion for transitional zone lesions is reserved for moderate T2 lesion which is lenticular or non-circumscribed and moderately T2 hypointense (PIRADS 5 >1.5 cm).
Three plane T2 imaging is common practice and enables full assessment of the peripheral zone of the prostate, particularly examining for extra-capsular extension, bladder base or seminal vesical invasion. T2 is also the most important sequence for lesions in the transitional zone.
The T1 weighted sequences are also useful to check for the presence of any haemorrhagic foci although since most patients now undergo their MRI scan prior to any biopsies being taken this has become far less important.
Interestingly the ADC map is more sensitive for carcinoma of the prostate (in the peripheral zone) than the DWI sequences. A finding of focal low signal on the ADC map may be seen in the absence of a corresponding high DWI focus. In the transitional zone however, the T2 sequences are more sensitive.",False,"I chose this answer because a negative trans-rectal biopsy is often used to rule out prostate cancer in the transitional zone. A trans-rectal biopsy is a procedure in which a sample of tissue is taken from the prostate and examined for cancerous cells. If no cancerous cells are present, then this is reassuring that the patient does not have prostate cancer in the transitional zone.",1,"3. A question about the application of knowledge, what is the best course of action?

This is the classic description for a second branchial cleft cyst extending between the carotid bifurcation.
 A carotid body tumour is also described as relating to the carotid bifurcation. The word usually used is âsplayingâ of the internal and external carotid arteries. Although they can happen at almost any age, the peak incidence tends to be around the 50s or 60s mark.

There is bony remodelling and mass effect on the cord but the person presenting the case points out that the exit foraminae are unaffected with no dumbbell protrusion visible. Dumbell protrusion is NOT a known association for which of the following?,SBA: Musculoskeletal and Trauma,Epidermoid,Neurofibroma,Meningioma,Schwannoma,Ganglioneuroma,A,33%,4%,50%,6%,6%,"Explanation:
Dumbell lesions of the spinal cord are those which extend from the canal to the paravertebral space via the exit foramina and are a classic finding for the following intradural tumours:
Schwannoma
Neurofibroma
Ganglioneuroma
Neuroblastoma
Meningioma
By process of elimination therefore the answer for this question must be an Epidermoid since large lesions of the other potential answers are all likely to show dumbbell protrusion through the neural foramina. Meningiomas in the spine do not cause bony hyperostosis like they might in the brain, neither do they cause bony remodelling.
The table below is by no means exhaustive but gives a good grounding on the topic of intra vs extramedullary lesions.
  Intradural, intramedullary
Intradural, extramedullary
Extradural (aka epidural)
Epidermoid

   ",True,"Epidermoid is a type of tumor that is characterized by the presence of squamous epithelial cells and keratin-filled cysts. It is not associated with dumbbell protrusion, which is a type of spinal cord compression caused by a tumor or other mass lesion that protrudes through the spinal canal and into the intervertebral foramen. This type of compression is most commonly seen with meningiomas, schwannomas, neurofibromas, and ganglioneuromas, but not epidermoids.",1,"3.

Dumbbell protrusion refers to the extension of a spinal tumor through the intervertebral foramen, causing widening of the foramen and giving it a characteristic dumbbell shape. This is commonly seen in nerve sheath tumors like neurofibromas, schwannomas, and ganglioneuromas. Meningiomas, although less common, can also present with dumbbell protrusion.

The carpal tunnel contains a total of nine flexor tendons (but not the muscles themselves), surrounded by a synovial sheath, and the median nerve. The tendons contained within the carpal tunnel are:
Flexor digitorum profundus (four tendons)
Flexor digitorum superficialis (four tendons)
Flexor pollicis longus (one tendon)
  The eight tendons of the flexor digitorum profundus and superficialis are surrounded by a single synovial sheath, whereas the tendon of flexor pollicis longus is surrounded by its own synovial sheath. These sheaths allow free movement of the tendons.
The tendon of flexor carpi radialis does not pass through the carpal tunnel, but is instead located within the flexor retinaculum itself.",True,I chose this answer because the flexor pollicis longus is one of the tendons that passes through the carpal tunnel.

9991,205045,A 17-year-old man falls at home and suffers a wrist fracture. While he is having a cast applied his parents discuss their concerns with an A+E doctor. The patient has just returned from a month abroad. His parents become increasingly concerned that their son has changed. He is no longer interested in visiting his friends and sits for hours at home doing nothing. They have also noticed a tremor to his hands and some slurring of his speech. His x-ray shows generalised osteoporotic changes and a few small subarticular cysts. The triangular fibrocartilage complex appears to contain some calcification. What is the most likely diagnosis?,SBA: Paediatrics,Wilson disease,Haemochromatosis,Calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease,Enteropathic arthropathy,Alkaptonuria,A,65%,9%,12%,4%,10%,"Explanation:
Wilson disease
Inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion, this disease results from an excess of copper within the body due to the inability of the liver to excrete it. It can present in childhood with cirrhosis but later presentations are more likely to be due to the neuropsychiatric manifestations. Clinically adolescent or adult patients develop tremor and dysarthria due to copper deposition in the lentiform nucleus. The classic diagnostic feature is Kayser-Fleischer pigment rings in the eyes. Radiologically the following features can be seen:
Hepatic manifestations: The liver appears normal on MRI since fatty infiltration effectively cancels out the paramagnetic effects of copper
Musculoskeletal manifestations: Generalised osteoporosis, subarticular cysts, chondrocalcinosis and arthropathy which can mimic CPPD
CNS manifestations: White matter atrophy and T2 hyperintensities predominantly affecting the basal ganglia and thalami. T1 signal is also high in these areas, differentiating it from many of the other basal ganglia disorders. There is a classical feature of âsparing of the red nucleusâ leading to an appearance known as the giant panda sign at the level of the pons.
  Alkaptonuria also known as ochronosis
This condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. It is caused by excessive circulating levels of homogentisic acid (HGA) when the enzyme which would usually degrade it is deficient. HGA has an affinity for collagen and accumulates in the connective tissues throughout the body. In visible light HGA has a blackish colour and thus the disease can be diagnosed in infancy when a babyâs nappies are stained black by the presence of HGA in the urine. By the time patients reach their 20s pigmentation may be visible in their skin, particularly the ears. This is initially a dark yellow colour (hence the term ochronosis, from âOchreâ in Greek meaning a dark yellow colour) but can progress to blue-grey and black.
  In imaging chondrocalcinosis is the most prominent feature, with calcification and destruction of the intervertebral discs. Premature osteoarthritic changes to the hands, feet, shoulders, hips and knees will also develop as the collagen deteriorates. Deposition in the heart and kidneys too leads to cardiac and renal failure.
  Haemochromatosis
The primary version of this disease can be inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion. Excess dietary iron is absorbed and this accumulates in all tissues of the body leading to various different problems.
Secondary haemochromatosis can arise if patients receive numerous blood transfusions without sufficient chelation to mitigate against the iron overload.
Cirrhosis â the presence of the excess iron in the liver leads to unusual signal properties on an MRI scan. Iron is paramagnetic and causes spin dephasing. T2* and T2 sequences are particularly vulnerable to this effect but lower than expected signal will be seen on all sequences. Importantly the signal from the spleen and bone marrow should be normal. By contrast they will be involved in cases of transfusional siderosis.
Generalised osteoporosis
Hook like osteophytes on the radial aspect of the metacarpal heads â these are highly characteristic
Chondrocalcinosis, particularly affecting the knees
Insulin dependent diabetes
Congestive cardiomyopathy
Skin pigmentation
  Calcium pyrophosphate dehydrate disease (CPPD) also known as pseudogout
CPPD can present in an acute or subacute fashion but is also seen as a chronic cause of joint inflammation. It may be misdiagnosed as simple osteoarthritis owing to its often bilateral and symmetrical distribution but there are also a couple of areas of the body which can be affected in particular, and which would be unusual for isolated degenerative changes.
The patellofemoral joint â joint space loss here can be extremely striking with almost complete preservation of the joint space at the medial and lateral compartments of the knee
Triangular fibrocartilaginous complex of the wrist â calcification
Radiocarpal joints â degenerative changes without involvement of the DIPs and PIPs
  Enteropathic arthropathy
Sacroiliitis and spondylitis are the hallmarks of enteropathic arthropathy. It is an important seronegative spondyloarthropathy. Outside of the axial skeleton, other features common to all seronegative spondyloarthropathies are also found. These include arthritis in the hands and feet, uveitis, and enthesitis (especially calcaneal). Interestingly although it is most commonly discussed in relation to Crohnâs disease and ulcerative colitis, only 5 and 10% respectively of patients with these conditions will develop enteropathic arthropathy. By contrast of patients with Whipple disease, around 75-90% of them will suffer from enteropathic arthropathy. Infection with Salmonella, Shigella and Yersinia are also known associations.",False,"Calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease (CPPD) is the most likely diagnosis in this case. CPPD is a type of crystal deposition arthritis that is associated with osteoporotic changes and subarticular cysts. It is also associated with triangular fibrocartilage complex calcification, which is what was seen on the x-ray. CPPD is also more common in patients who have recently returned from a long trip abroad, which is the case with this patient.",2,,C,True,"I chose option 4, Wilson disease, because the symptoms and findings described in the scenario are consistent with this condition. Wilson disease is a rare genetic disorder that causes copper to accumulate in the liver, brain, and other vital organs. The symptoms mentioned, such as a change in behavior, tremor in hands, and slurring of speech, can be attributed to the neurological effects of copper accumulation in the brain. 

Additionally, the x-ray findings of generalized osteoporotic changes and subarticular cysts can be associated with Wilson disease, as it can lead to bone demineralization and joint abnormalities. The calcification of the triangular fibrocartilage complex further supports this diagnosis.

The other options do not fit as well with the presented symptoms and findings:
1. Haemochromatosis involves iron accumulation, not copper, and primarily affects the liver, heart, and pancreas.
2. Calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease mainly affects joints and presents with acute inflammatory arthritis.
3. Enteropathic arthropathy is related to inflammatory bowel disease and primarily affects the peripheral joints and spine.

9766,205045,A 52-year-old man complains of a painful lump in his left foot. He visits his GP who suspects he may have a Morton neuroma and refers him for an ultrasound scan. What is the best position for assessing whether the patient has a Morton neuroma?,SBA: Musculoskeletal and Trauma,Sitting with feet slightly plantar flexed,Passive dorsiflexion,Standing on tiptoes with active dorsiflexion,Lying supine,Sitting with feet on the floor,A,53%,25%,5%,13%,3%,"Explanation:
Morton neuroma
Fibrosis surrounding a plantar digital nerve leads to a hard lump developing in the sole of the foot. Patients complain of a painful lump which feels a bit like walking on a hot lump of gravel. On an MRI scan they are often slightly disguised by their low or isointensity to muscle on T1 weighted sequences and hypointensity on T2 weighted sequences. Curiously for a fibrotic process, they do usually enhance with gadolinium. On ultrasound the classic appearance of a hypoechoic mass situated between but slightly proximal to the metatarsal heads should be sufficient to make the diagnosis. Most are found in the third metatarsal space. The Mulder sign can be performed clinically or with ultrasound and involves eliciting pain and a clicking sound when the metatarsal heads are squeezed together while applying pressure on the dorsum of the foot over the neuroma, or scanning the sole of the foot.
It is said that Morton neuromas are larger and easier to visualise with MRI when the patient is prone, i.e. the foot is slightly plantar-flexed. On ultrasound this translates to a straightforward prone position or one where the patient is sitting on the side of the couch with their feet slightly plantar flexed. One theory is that any physical tension through the metatarsal joints (more likely on supine positioning) causes the neuroma to be pulled up in-between the metatarsal heads.",True,"Sitting with feet slightly plantar flexed is the best position for assessing whether the patient has a Morton neuroma. This position allows the clinician to palpate the area between the metatarsal heads, which is where the neuroma is typically located. This position also allows for maximum compression of the area, which can help to confirm the diagnosis.",3,"3. A question about practical application, how to correctly perform a procedure.

This question falls under category 3: A question about practical application, how to correctly perform a procedure.",E,False,"I chose option 1, passive dorsiflexion, because it is the best position for assessing whether the patient has a Morton neuroma. In this position, the patient's foot is dorsiflexed (toes pulled up towards the shin) by the examiner, which helps to widen the intermetatarsal spaces and stretch the interdigital nerves.

10591,205045,A 76-year-old lady with biopsy proven rectal adenocarcinoma undergoes an MRI scan for local staging. She has T3N1M0 disease and surgery is being planned. Her case is discussed at the local MDT and the colorectal surgeon is enquiring about the risk of recurrence. The additional presence of which of the following is responsible for an increase in the risk of recurrence in this patient?,SBA: Gastrointestinal,A low tumour,Nodal disease within the circumferential resection margin,A circumferential resection margin of 3mm,Involvement of the mesorectal fat,Involvement of the muscularis propria,A,30%,18%,8%,38%,6%,"Explanation:
Involvement of the muscularis propria is simply indicative of the tumour being a T3 tumour. Involvement of the mesorectal fat is to be expected in T3 disease. Nodal disease within the CRM is resectable and a CRM of 3mm confers no greater risk.
Low tumours have a higher risk of recurrence since there is less fat within the mesorectal fascia and the CRM is more likely to be involved at an earlier point in time.
  Rectal cancer MRI
The muscularis propria is the outer wall of the rectum and shows up as low signal on T2 weighted sequences.
Since the rectum (like the oesophagus) does not have a serosa, once spread beyond the muscularis propria into the mesorectal fat has occurred (i.e. a T3 tumour), nodal involvement is also feasible. The mesorectal fascia is a thin plane of connective tissue which contains fat, the rectum, local lymph nodes as a distinct anatomical entity and is of paramount importance in rectal cancer management. Spread beyond the mesorectal fascia denotes a T4 tumour. MRI is excellent for local staging of rectal cancer because the mesorectal fascia is seen clearly as a thin black line on T2 weighted sequences and its involvement or lack thereof can be readily discerned. In contrast, the tumour appears as intermediate signal on T2, distorting the normal anatomy. The fascia is also referred to as the âCRMâ which stands for circumferential resection margin and relates to the surgical operation performed for rectal tumours, namely a total mesorectal excision (TME). The proximity of the tumour extent to the CRM is prognostically important; tumours with a >1mm margin before they reach the CRM are far less likely to recur. A <1mm margin is taken as involvement of the CRM.
A distinction is also drawn between lower and upper rectal tumours (as defined by distance from the anorectal angle). Inferiorly there is far less fat contained within the mesorectal fascia and consequently tumour can involve the CRM earlier on.
  Rectal cancer staging
The following table heavily paraphrases the TNM stages for rectal cancer. There are multiple subdivisions which are not covered here either. The focus for this table is radiologically distinct entities as well as the points at which the management alters.
  Stage
Radiology
Management
<T3
Not involving the muscularis propria
Surgical resection (Must also be N0. If N1 or N2 then needs neo-adjuvant chemotherapy)
T3
Involving muscularis propria
Neo-adjuvant chemoradiotherapy â surgery â+/- post-op chemotherapy
T4
Beyond the CRM
N1
1-3 nodes
It is important to discern if any of the nodes are situated outside of the CRM â these will not routinely be resected in a TME but can be resected separately or included in radiotherapy fields.
N2
4 or more lymph nodes
M1
External iliac, inguinal nodes, hepatic metastases
Solitary hepatic metastases can potentially still be curatively resected.
Palliative chemotherapy.
Palliative stenting.
 ",False,Involvement of the mesorectal fat is responsible for an increase in the risk of recurrence in this patient because it is an indication that the tumor has spread beyond the rectal wall and into the surrounding lymph nodes.

One of the first widespread uses of laminar flow operating theatres was for joint replacement operations as the potential consequences of an infected prosthesis are significant.

In this scenario, the patient presents with symptoms suggestive of an infection following a total hip replacement surgery. The 111In â WBC scan involves labeling the patient's white blood cells with a radioactive tracer, which then accumulates at the site of infection. This allows for accurate localization and identification of an infection, which is crucial for appropriate management and treatment.

Options 1, 3, 4, and 5 are less appropriate for diagnosing a peri-prosthetic infection in this case:

1. Plain films alone may show some signs of infection, such as periosteal reaction or bone destruction, but they are not sensitive or specific enough to establish the diagnosis of a peri-prosthetic infection.

3. 99m-Tc â MDP (Technetium-99m Methylene Diphosphonate) nuclear medicine test is a bone scan that can show increased bone turnover, but it is not specific for infection and can also be positive in cases of aseptic loosening, inflammation, and other conditions.

4. MRI with a dedicated post-op hip coil can be useful for evaluating soft tissue and bone marrow abnormalities, but it may be less accurate in detecting peri-prosthetic infections due to the presence of metal artifacts from the hip prosthesis.

There are no findings of major trauma but there is a 1.5cm well-rounded mass close to the tail of the pancreas. It is isodense to the spleen. The patient goes on to have a 99mTc â sulphur colloid scan on which the mass shows good uptake. What is the most likely diagnosis?,SBA: Gastrointestinal,Accessory spleen,Lymph node,Pancreatic pseudocyst,False splenic cyst,Exophytic renal angiomyolipoma,A,97%,1%,1%,1%,0%,"Explanation:
Splenic variants
Rarely (<1% of patients) the spleen can migrate from its usual position and end up virtually anywhere else within the abdominal cavity. This is of no clinical consequence unless the consequently long and tortuous vessels supplying it become compromised by torsion or the patient undergoes abdominal surgery. On imaging the wandered spleen should exhibit the usual characteristics of a normally positioned spleen but if there is any doubt as to the diagnosis confirmation with a 99mTc-sulphur-colloid scan can be sought.
Accessory spleens or splenunculi are relatively common (30% of patients) and can usually be found close to the splenic hilum or tail of the pancreas. They follow the spleen on all modalities and should not be mistaken for intra-abdominal lymph nodes.
Polysplenia is a condition which arises as part of left-sided isomerism (also known as heterotaxy). In Left-sided isomerism all of the features which would usually be found on the left side of the body are found on both, or right sided features are found on the left side (such as the liver). Vice versa is true for right-sided isomerism. Right-sided isomerism usually presents earlier on due to the greater complexity of associated cardiac abnormalities.

She is managed conservatively and 36 hours later undergoes an MRI scan for follow up. What will the likely appearance of the haemorrhage be now? Select ONE answer only.,SBA: Central Nervous and Head & Neck,Dark on T1 and dark on T2,Isointense on T1 and bright on T2,Dark on T1 and bright on T2,Bright on T1 and dark on T2,Bright on T1 and bright on T2,A,31%,13%,4%,47%,5%,"Explanation:
At 2 days old, the bleed is acute; iso/dark on T1 and dark on T2. Chronic bleeds are dark on T1 and dark-rimmed on T2 (bright centre).
This question is to do with the imaging characteristics of blood within the brain. We can think of the intracranial space as a closed box as far as oxygen tensions go which means that blood degrades in a predictable fashion and therefore has predictable appearances on T1 and T2 according to the changes in the haemoglobin molecule. There are a few different methods to help remember the changes in appearance, one of which is the table below:
  Time-frame Haemoglobin T1 T2 Mnemonic
Hyperacute (hours)   Iso Bright - IBBY
Acute (0-2 days) Intracellular deoxyHb Dark / Iso Dark - IDDY
Early subacute (3-7 days) Intracellular metHb Bright Dark - BIDDY
Late subacute (8-30 days) Extracellular metHb Bright Bright - BABY
Chronic (> 30 days) Intracellular haemosiderin Dark Dark rim - DODO
  In real life and for the 2b exam the important distinction is around the subacute stages.
In that case, by and large, if it is bright on T1 it is subacute and T2 then decides if it is early or late subacute. The timeframes given are also important and can form the basis of 2a exam questions.
 Signal from chronic haematoma often causes confusion since the T2 signal in particular can be quite variable. In general the haematoma will show a dark haemosiderin ring on T2 weighted images but since the centre becomes effectively CSF, or CSF-like fluid, it can follow CSF signal and would therefore return high signal on T2 weighted sequences.
  Of the other answers provided therefore:
Bright on T1 and dark on T2 = Early subacute
Dark on T1 and bright on T2 = Chronic
Dark on T1 and dark on T2 = Acute
Isointense on T1 and bright on T2 = Hyperacute
Bright on T1 and bright on T2 = Late subacute",False,"The correct answer is 3. Dark on T1 and bright on T2. This is because intraparenchymal haemorrhages appear dark on T1 and bright on T2 due to the presence of methaemoglobin, which has high T2 signal and low T1 signal.",1,"3.

3. A question about interpretation of data, such as lab results or imaging.",D,False,"I chose option 2 (Dark on T1 and bright on T2) because it best represents the typical appearance of a subacute intraparenchymal hemorrhage on MRI at 36 hours post-injury. 

At this stage, the hemorrhage is in the subacute phase, where the hemoglobin in the blood starts to break down into various products. One of these products is extracellular methemoglobin, which typically appears hypointense (dark) on T1-weighted images and hyperintense (bright) on T2-weighted images. This is due to the paramagnetic properties of methemoglobin, which cause these distinct signal changes on MRI.",C,True,A,False,"[{""page_content"": ""signs and is also recommended for further evaluation of all patients \nwith any abnormal findings.

There are two cruciate ligaments that help to stabilize the knee joint. They connect the femur and the tibia and cross each other in doing so.
The anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) is the weaker of the two ligaments. It arises from the anterior part of the intercondylar area of the tibia and extends superiorly, posteriorly and laterally to attach to the posterior part of the lateral condyle of the femur.

What is the likely location of the primary lesion? Select ONE answer only.,SBA: Cardiothoracic and vascular,AP window,Right upper lobe,Lingular,Right middle lobe,Right paratracheal,A,64%,13%,2%,2%,19%,"Explanation:
Focal unilateral vocal cord uptake on a PET-CT scan is more likely to be due to the increased workload of the contralateral vocal cord muscles compensating for ipsilateral paralysis from involvement of the ipsilateral recurrent laryngeal nerve in the chest rather than metastatic infiltration of the contralateral vocal cord itself.
Vocal cord paralysis is a known sign of thoracic malignancy owing to innervation by the recurrent laryngeal nerve.
Left - passes through the aortopulmonary window, under the aorta 
Right - passes under the right subclavian artery
  Infiltration of one of these nerves would lead to a unilateral vocal cord palsy. Since the left has a longer thoracic course, it is at greater risk of involvement in a thoracic malignancy. Infiltration may be by the index mass itself, or by an involved lymph node distant from the primary mass.",False,The presence of avid uptake in the right vocal cord suggests that the primary lesion is located in the right upper lobe. This is because the right vocal cord is located in the same area as the right upper lobe and the uptake of the PET-CT scan indicates that the lesion is located there.,2,,B,True,"I chose option 2 (AP window) because the PET-CT scan shows avidity in both the thoracic lesion and the right vocal cord. The AP (aortopulmonary) window is a mediastinal location, and primary tumors in this area can cause direct invasion or compression of the recurrent laryngeal nerve, which controls the vocal cords.

10816,205045,A 59-year-old man known to have HIV undergoes a CXR which shows new nodular shadowing in the right upper lobe. What is the most likely diagnosis?,SBA: Cardiothoracic and vascular,Tuberculosis,PCP,Cryptococcus,Histoplasma,CMV,A,63%,19%,7%,5%,6%,"Explanation:
The opportunistic infections consequent on AIDS have a variety of radiological manifestations. The normal range for CD4 lymphocytes is 800-1000 per mm3. As the patient becomes increasingly immunocompromised different diseases appear.
  Image Â© Medical Exam Prep
  Tuberculosis
In AIDs patients the radiological appearance of an infection with tuberculosis changes depending on the CD4 count although, of the HIV related diseases, tuberculosis can occur at a far higher CD4 count.
<350cells/mm3 â resembles post-primary TB
<200cells/mm3 â resembles primary TB or miliary TB
Primary tuberculosis leads to consolidation with lymph node enlargement and pleural effusions. Of note the lymph nodes can be low in attenuation with rim enhancement.
Post-primary tuberculosis is often seen as cavitation in upper lobe consolidative lesions on a background of characteristic tree-in-bud appearance. It can progress to fibrosis with volume loss and traction bronchiectasis.
  There are a number of eponymous features of tuberculosis infection.
A Simon focus â this is the healed site of a primary infection in the apex of the lung
A Ghon lesion â this is a calcified lugn lesion <5mm in diameter
A Ranke complex â this refers to the presence of a Ghon lesion as well as calcified lymph nodes
A Rasmussen aneurysm â this is a pulmonary artery aneurysm within the wall of a tuberculous cavity
    Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) â also known as pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP)
PCP has many different appearances on imaging. Bilateral ground glass opacification (GGO) is the most consistent feature and is often seen in a perihilar and basilar distribution. Approximately half of cases show a patchwork pattern of GGO where there is sparing of some pulmonary segments. The âblack bronchusâ sign can be seen where the extent of ground glass opacification causes the bronchi to appear black against the GGO. Lung cysts (pneumatocoeles) are also a feature, hence the name. PCP is usually not thought to be associated with lymph nodes or effusions but either or both can be seen in approximately 15% of cases. Similarly pneumothoraces are a complicating feature in around 12% of cases. Largely speaking however these three are usually described to be absent in an exam question setting.
Owing to the severity of the illness, many patients receive prophylaxis with aerosolized pentamidine and this can lead to an alternative presentation with upper lobe disease. These patients are more likely to experience a spontaneous pneumothorax than those not on prophylaxis.
The presenting symptoms of patients with PCP are relatively non-specific: dysponea, dry cough, and malaise. The CD4 count, if given, should be <200cells/mm3.
  CMV pneumonia 
Infection with CMV is common among AIDS patients but not all cases are diagnosed prior to the autopsy prevalence of over 50%; it does not cause significant morbidity or mortality. When it does manifest radiologically the findings are relatively non-specific with bronchiectasis, nodules and hazy infiltrates seen in a bilateral symmetrical distribution. It is often diagnosed concurrently with Kaposi sarcoma. There can be significant overlap between the appearances of CMV pneumonia and PCP. The main differences to look for would be an apical predominance for PCP (especially in those taking prophylactic pentamidine), and the presence of cysts in PCP.
  Cryptococcal pneumonia 
Masses and nodules with or without both lymph nodes and effusions are the main findings for cryptococcal pneumonia in AIDs patients. Cavity formation within lung masses can also be seen ergo cryptococcal pneumonia is one of the differential diagnoses for cavitating lung lesions. The patients often also have concurrent cerebral cryptococcal disease. The fungus is found in bird excreta which can sometimes be a pointer in an exam question setting.
  Histoplasmosis
In immunocompetent individuals infection with histoplasmosis is sub-clinical in the vast majority of cases. In immunodeficient patients however it is a different story; it can be fatal. AIDs patients are at risk if their CD4 count is below 150cells/mm3.
Patients present in a non-specific manner with fever, malaise, diarrhoea, and vomiting but around half will have no CXR findings. On CT miliary disease is seen as well as reticulonodular and air space opacities. Like cryptococcal, histoplasma is found in bird excreta.",True,"I chose this answer because tuberculosis is the most common cause of nodular shadowing in the right upper lobe of a person with HIV. Tuberculosis is an infectious disease caused by the bacteria Mycobacterium tuberculosis, which can affect any part of the body, including the lungs. People with HIV are at an increased risk of contracting tuberculosis due to their weakened immune system.",2,,A,True,"I chose option 2, Tuberculosis, as the most likely diagnosis for the following reasons:

1. The patient is a 59-year-old man with a known history of HIV, which puts him at a higher risk for opportunistic infections, including tuberculosis (TB).

2. The CXR shows new nodular shadowing in the right upper lobe, which is a common radiographic finding in patients with pulmonary tuberculosis. TB often presents as nodular infiltrates or cavitations in the upper lobes of the lungs.

3. Although the other options (PCP, Cryptococcus, Histoplasma, and CMV) are also potential opportunistic infections in HIV patients, their typical radiographic findings do not match the described CXR findings in this case as closely as tuberculosis does.

However, it is important to note that a definitive diagnosis would require further investigation, such as sputum samples for acid-fast bacilli (AFB) staining and culture, as well as potentially a biopsy or bronchoscopy.",A,False,E,True,"[{""page_content"": ""CXR (nonspecific):\n\n\u221a\u00a0\u00a0absence of findings\n\n\u221a\u00a0\u00a0fine reticulonodular pattern in both lower lungs\n\n\u221a\u00a0\u00a0resembling airspace disease (in severe form)\n\nHRCT:\n\n\u221a\u00a0\u00a0ill-defined centrilobular nodules of varying size\r\n(100%)\n\n\u221a\u00a0\u00a0ground-glass opacities (100%) \u2190 diffuse interstitial\r\ninflammation\n\n\u221a\u00a0\u00a0subpleural small nodules (in majority)"", ""metadata"": {""source"": ""source_documents\\(Radiology Review, Green Book Radiology) Wolfgang F.

The dorsal pancreas is the neck, body and tail. The ventral pancreas is the head.
The key differentiator between dorsal pancreatic agenesis and lipomatosis is the absence of the pancreatic duct. If no duct is visualised, this suggests agenesis over lipomatosis. Furthermore, lipomatosis usually affects the whole gland and does not spare the pancreatic head. Dorsal agenesis is much more common than total pancreatic agenesis.
The most common cause of pancreatic lipomatosis in children is cystic fibrosis, the second most common cause is Shwachman-Diamond syndrome. Additional features of this condition include short stature with metaphyseal chondroplasia and eczema. Steroid use and Cushing syndrome are also associated with lipomatosis.",False,"Ventral pancreatic agenesis is the most likely underlying diagnosis in this case. This condition is characterized by the absence of the neck, body, and tail of the pancreas, with only fat signal seen in the pancreatic bed in these regions.

10296,205045,A 36-year-old woman has a cardiac MRI for investigation of shortness of breath. The pericardium measures 5mm in depth. Her right atrium is enlarged with a small right ventricle. Clinically she has shown features consistent with right heart failure. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?,SBA: Cardiothoracic and vascular,Constrictive pericarditis,Tricuspid regurgitation,Marfan syndrome,Ehlers-Danlos syndrome,Neurofibromatosis type 1,A,76%,18%,1%,3%,1%,"Explanation:
Inflammation of the pericardium is termed pericarditis and leads to fibrous thickening. Most commonly this occurs either post-operatively in patients undergoing cardiac surgery or as an idiopathic entity although historically it was tuberculosis which was the most common cause of pericarditis. The diagnosis is predominantly clinical with symptoms such as malaise or dyspnoea and signs such as neck vein distension or paradoxical movement of the JVP. On cross sectional imaging thickening of the pericardium to greater than 2mm can be seen and the fibrosis causes a restriction in distensibility. The right ventricle, being more compliant than the left, becomes flattened and furthermore there can be curvature of the septum towards the left. Counterintuitively the right atrium can also be dilated; this secondary to the high filling pressure in the right ventricle. Elsewhere, if the field of view permits, accessory signs such as pleural effusions and even ascites may be seen.",True,"Constrictive pericarditis is the most likely diagnosis based on the given information. The patient's enlarged right atrium and small right ventricle are consistent with right heart failure, which is a common symptom of constrictive pericarditis. Additionally, the finding of a pericardium measuring 5mm in depth is consistent with constrictive pericarditis, as this is a thickening of the pericardium that can lead to impaired ventricular filling and heart failure. The other conditions listed are not typically associated with right heart failure and/or thickening of the pericardium.",2,,A,True,"I chose option 2, Constrictive pericarditis, as the most likely diagnosis because the patient's symptoms and imaging findings align with this condition. 

Constrictive pericarditis occurs when the pericardium, the sac surrounding the heart, becomes thickened and less flexible. This can lead to impaired filling of the heart chambers, which in turn can cause right-sided heart failure. The patient's cardiac MRI shows a thickened pericardium (5mm in depth) and an enlarged right atrium with a small right ventricle, which are consistent with constrictive pericarditis. Additionally, the patient is experiencing shortness of breath and has clinical features of right heart failure, further supporting this diagnosis. 

The other options are less likely based on the given information:

1. Tricuspid regurgitation may cause right-sided heart failure, but it would not typically cause pericardial thickening.
3. Marfan syndrome is a connective tissue disorder that primarily affects the skeletal, ocular, and cardiovascular systems. While it can cause cardiovascular issues, the findings described in this case are not typical for Marfan syndrome.
4. Ehlers-Danlos syndrome is another connective tissue disorder, but it is not typically associated with the cardiac findings described in this case.

Which of the following is not a likely complication of pseudomembranous colitis?,SBA: Gastrointestinal,Pneumobilia,Toxic megacolon,Pneumatosis coli,Perforation,Peritonitis,A,68%,15%,8%,3%,6%,"Explanation:
Pseudomembranous colitis
Antibiotic therapy, particularly with broad spectrum penicillins, can deplete the normal colonic flora and permit overgrowth of clostridium difficile. Some patients may be asymptomatic from this overgrowth but others can develop pseudomembranous colitis. There will be a profuse watery diarrhoea with abdominal pains and fever. The condition is defined by the development of a pseudomembrane of exuded fibrin and cellular debris within the colon seen on endoscopy. Both endoscopic and fluoroscopic examinations are contraindicated in severe cases owing to the risk of perforation. On CT around a third of patients have no findings at all but more usually there is diffuse colonic wall thickening affecting the entire colon and to an extent which is not seen in any other disease process (except Crohn disease).The accordion sign occurs when oral contrast medium sits between the closely spaced oedematous folds of the colon. Pericolonic fat stranding is disproportionately mild but ascites is a common co-existent finding. Complicating features which should be ruled out on a CT scan include toxic megacolon, pneumatosis coli and portal venous gas. Gas in the bile ducts (pneumobilia) is not an expected complication.",False,"Pneumatosis coli is not a complication of pseudomembranous colitis. Pneumatosis coli is a condition in which air or gas is present in the wall of the colon, and is usually caused by a disruption of the mucosal barrier. It can be seen in a variety of conditions, including inflammatory bowel disease, ischemia, and infection. Pseudomembranous colitis, on the other hand, is an infection caused by the overgrowth of Clostridium difficile bacteria, which leads to inflammation and damage to the colonic mucosa. The complications associated with this condition include toxic megacolon, perforation, and peritonitis.",2,"This question falls under category 2: A question about clinical judgement, what is the correct diagnosis?",A,True,"I chose option 4, Pneumobilia, because it is not a likely complication of pseudomembranous colitis.

Pseudomembranous colitis is an infection of the colon caused by the bacterium Clostridium difficile, which leads to inflammation and the formation of pseudomembranes in the colon.

It is usually the middle meningeal artery which has been torn. This runs over the temporo-parietal regions.",False,"The frontal bone is the most likely to be fractured if there is an extradural haemorrhage present. This is because the extradural haemorrhage is typically caused by a head injury that involves a blow to the head, which is most likely to affect the frontal bone due to its location at the front of the skull. The frontal bone is also the most vulnerable part of the skull due to its thinness.",1,This question falls under category 1 - Basic factual recall.,C,True,"I chose option 2, the parietal bone, because extradural (epidural) hemorrhages are often associated with skull fractures, particularly in the parietal region.

Select ONE answer only.,"SBA: Genito urinary, Adrenal, Obstetrics & Gynaecology and Breast",Orchitis,Lymphoma,Leukaemia,Metastases,Sarcoidosis,A,72%,12%,6%,4%,6%,"Explanation:
Please note the question asks for the LEAST likely diagnosis.
The differential diagnosis for bilateral testicular masses is reasonably short. Lymphoma is the most likely cause, especially in men aged over 60. Sarcoidosis is also a common cause of this uncommon finding. Leukaemia is difficult to differentiate from lymphoma on imaging alone and the two are usually discussed in tandem. Testicular metastases are most common in patients over the age of 50 and the primary site is most commonly prostate or lung.
Orchitis is unlikely to present as a testicular lump and tends to be a more diffuse process rather than hypoechoic masses. Bilateral testicular abscesses could be a differential diagnosis however clinical correlation is key.

Obviously surgical emphysema is not unlikely in the overall setting of trauma however it is not a direct sign of aortic transection.

Surgical emphysema, also known as subcutaneous emphysema, refers to the presence of air or gas in the subcutaneous tissue, usually resulting from trauma or surgery. This finding is not directly related to aortic transection.

Aortic transection is a life-threatening injury that occurs when the aorta, the largest artery in the body, is torn or ruptured. The signs of aortic transection on a chest x-ray typically include:

1. Trachea shift to the right: This can occur due to the widening of the mediastinum, which pushes the trachea to the right side.
2. Widening of the upper mediastinum: This can be a result of blood accumulating around the aorta due to the rupture.
3. Pleural effusions: Blood from the ruptured aorta can leak into the pleural space, causing fluid accumulation.
4. Indistinct aortic contour: The presence of blood around the aorta can make its borders appear less distinct on an x-ray.

13911,205045,A 70-year-old man undergoes an MRI scan of the base of his skull. He has previously undergone surgery for a left sided cholesteatoma and the surgeon is concerned there may be a recurrence. Within the surgical cavity on the left there is a mass which enhances on the post-contrast sequences but doesnât restrict diffusion. What is the most likely diagnosis? Select ONE answer only.,SBA: Central Nervous and Head & Neck,Granulation tissue,Recurrent cholesteatoma,Post-operative fluid,Otitis media,Cholesterol granuloma,A,81%,6%,2%,3%,9%,"Explanation:
Cholesteatomas are difficult to manage as they have a high recurrence rate. Imaging has a significant role to play in the management of recurrent cholesteatomas; distinguishing recurrence from post-operative granulation tissue or fluid is important.
  Diagnosis Restricts Diffusion Enhances
Recurrent cholesteatoma Yes No
Granulation tissue No Yes
Fluid No No
  Post-contrast sequences for recurrent cholesteatomas require a delay of around 45 minutes from giving the contrast to acquiring images as the granulation tissue is slow to take up contrast. This has obvious down-sides to any modern day busy MRI schedule. However since the management of post-operative granulation tissue and post-operative fluid is largely identical, namely expectant, it is not important to differentiate the one from the other. Thus findings on diffusion weighted sequences are the most important thing in post-operative cholesteatoma imaging.
  Cholesteatoma
Cholesteatomas (Acquired or congenital) are histolologically epidermoid cysts. On imaging the finding of non-dependant soft tissue and bony erosion within the middle ear is typical for a cholesteatoma.
There are two types of acquired cholesteatoma:
Pars flaccida (80%) â classically erodes the scutum and extends superiorly
Pars tensa (20%) â classically erodes the ossicles, extending medially
  These refer to the two parts of the tympanic membrane from which they arise.
  Image Â© Medical Exam Prep
  In due course, if left unattended, a cholesteatoma will expand to fill the entire middle ear. Prior to this point they can be seen as non-dependant soft tissue within the middle ear. Dependant soft tissue within the middle ear suggests the presence of fluid or pus and the diagnosis of a middle ear infection. Once a cholesteatoma has filled the middle ear completely however no gas remains from which to discern dependency.
There are a number of theories as to how cholesteatomas arise. One theory is that following a perforation of the tympanic membrane entry of desquamated stratified keratinised squamous epithelium from the external auditory canal into the middle ear is permitted. There it adheres to the tympanic membrane and proliferates unrelentingly causing a soft tissue mass to form and eventually leading to bony erosion of the ossicles, scutum and/or other parts of the middle ear.
A congenital cholesteatoma behaves in a similar manner but is present from birth due to an aberrant location of a tiny island of keratinised squamous epithelium.
  Cholesterol granuloma
A cholesterol granuloma occurs as a sequela of recurrent bouts of otitis media. Haemorrhage within the middle ear leads to the formation of granulation tissue. On imaging this is seen as opacification of the middle ear on CT. Bony changes can occur chronically with bony expansion, or displacement and even destruction of the ossicles. The signals characteristics on MRI are therefore important to distinguish it from a cholesteatoma. Whereas a cholesteatoma on MRI is isointense to brain parenchyma on T1, a cholesterol granuloma will show high signal in the middle ear on T1 due to the paramagnetic effects of methaemoglobin. On clinical examination the ENT surgeon may report a bulging blue tympanic membrane. This is classical. Dehiscence of the jugular bulb is an important differential diagnosis to exclude as this will also give a blue tympanic membrane on examination but the management is radically different!",False,"Recurrent cholesteatoma is the most likely diagnosis because the mass is located within the surgical cavity on the left where the cholesteatoma was previously removed, and it enhances on the post-contrast sequences. This is a classic sign of recurrent cholesteatoma. Granulation tissue, post-operative fluid, otitis media, and cholesterol granuloma are all less likely diagnoses.",2,,B,True,"I chose option 4, granulation tissue, because the clinical scenario and MRI findings are consistent with this diagnosis. The patient has a history of surgery for a left-sided cholesteatoma, and the surgeon is concerned about a recurrence. Granulation tissue is commonly found in post-operative cases as it is a part of the normal healing process. The mass enhances on post-contrast sequences, which is typical for granulation tissue due to its increased vascularity. Additionally, the mass does not show restricted diffusion, which helps to differentiate it from a recurrent cholesteatoma, as cholesteatomas typically show restricted diffusion.",A,True,A,True,"[{""page_content"": ""bony involvement.

Eosinophilic granuloma causes round punched-out type lesions, usually described as having a bevelled edge. These would usually be solitary although multiple lesions are definitely possible. The symmetry of the lesions described in the question goes against this on grounds of probability though.
Fibrous dysplasia can affect the skull. It is usually described as having a ground glass appearance with cortical expansion and a swell-defined sclerotic margin.
Osteogenesis imperfecta is not usually part of the differential diagnosis for lytic lesions in the skull. Multiple wormian bones are part of the diagnostic criteria and at a stretch leptomeningeal cysts caused by skull fractures due to fragility could be brought into the picture.
Sinus pericranii is largely a soft tissue (vascular) mass which can cause secondary effects on the skull, including a localised defect. Again though, bilateral symmetrical defects would be unusual.",False,"Fibrous dysplasia is the most likely diagnosis because it is the most common cause of symmetrical lucencies in the skull vault on a Townes' view. Fibrous dysplasia is a benign condition caused by a mutation in a gene that results in abnormal bone development, which can cause lesions in the skull.

The two symmetrical 7mm well-circumscribed lucencies in the skull vault, one on either side, are characteristic of parietal foramina. These are normal anatomical variations where there are openings in the parietal bones of the skull. The absence of a mass on ultrasound also supports this diagnosis, as it indicates that the lucencies are not caused by a pathological process.

Wilms tumour (nephroblastoma)
This is the most common abdominal mass in children under the age of 8. There are reasonably strong associations with renal anomalies, genital anomalies, aniridia and Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (although the last of these also has an association with neuroblastoma). Presentation is usually with an abdominal mass and/or pain.

Calcification
Vascular invasion
Bilateral
Lung metastases
Poor histology
  On imaging the masses are usually heterogenous. Cystic areas can often be seen secondary to areas of necrosis. The claw sign occurs when there is a rim of normal renal tissue extending part of the way around the mass. A Wilms tumour is often described as enhancing but less so than the adjacent normal renal parenchyma.

Select ONE answer only.",SBA: Cardiothoracic and vascular,MRI with delayed contrast,Invasive angiogram,Dobutamine stress MRI,Adenosine stress MRI,Cardiac CT,A,85%,2%,4%,7%,3%,"Explanation:
This man has acute myocarditis. An MRI with delayed contrast should confirm this with either epicardial or midwall delayed enhancement. A cardiac CT or invasive angiogram will give information about the coronary vessels and the stress tests are better suited to revealing compensated areas of hypoperfusion. Treatment can be initiated while the patient is waiting to have their MRI.
      Image Â© Medical Exam Prep
      Adenosine stress MRI has overtaken dobutamine stress MRI in terms of sensitivity and specificity for investigating the presence of ischaemia or infarction. Adenosine causes coronary vasodilation. If there is a haemodynamically significant stenosis to a coronary vessel, the vessels distal to the stenosis are already maximally dilated to maximise flow and thus the application of adenosine makes no difference to the vessel calibre or the resultant perfusion. Furthermore, the vasodilatation to the remaining unoccluded vessels can 'steal' blood from the stenosed territory and this is seen as hypoperfusion to the affected territory. Dipyridamole (antiplatelet), blocks uptake of adenosine and so patients taking this are also poor candidates for this test, however dipyridimole itself can also induce vasodilatation so may be used as an agent in its own right instead of adenosine.
Contraindications to adenosine include:
Second or third degree heart block
Bronchospasm
Hypotension <90mmHg systolic
Myocardial infarction within 48hrs
Uncontrolled arrhythmia
Severe/critical aortic stenosis
The half-life of adenosine is exceptionally short, around 10 seconds, thus any side effects experienced during the scan resolve very quickly. It also means that during the scan, in order to maintain the effect, the adenosine must be given as an infusion.
  Dobutamine stress MRI used to be used but has largely been superseded by adenosine stress MRIs. Dobutamine is a sympathomimetic so works by inducing the heart to beat both faster and stronger. By increasing the stress on the whole heart, hitherto compensated areas are unmasked. The drug is given at increasing doses ever 3 minutes until any of:
The heart rate has increased to around 85% of its resting maximum
New wall motion abnormality is seen
Blood pressure rises above 240/220mmHg
Systolic blood pressure falls by 40mmHg
The patient develops persistent arrhythmias
The patient becomes too symptomatic to continue the scan
  Aside from the usual contra-indications to performing the MRI in the first place, specific contra-indications to performing a dobutamine stress MRI include:
Hypertension >220/120mmHg
Unstable angina
Aortic stenosis (severe)
Uncontrolled atrial fibrillation
Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy
Congestive heart failure
  A stress echocardiogram is particularly useful for further investigating patients in whom a stress ECG was inconclusive. Many patients are unable to tolerate the physical demands (treadmill) of a stress ECG. Patients are given dobutamine, much like for a stress cardiac MRI study. Wall-motion abnormalities can be seen, as with cardiac MRI, and these correspond to areas of non-viable or hibernating myocardium and provide targets for revascularisation. An echocardiogram has the obvious advantages of lower cost, wider availability and faster scanning time than an MRI. The contra-indications to this test are the same as those for cardiac MRI.
  Cardiac CT is indicated for acute cardiac or major vessel pathology as it is quick and more readily available than MRI. It can be used to assess the calcium-score of the coronary arteries as well as patency/occlusions to identify targets for acute revascularisation. It is also useful for quantifying aneurysmal dilatation of the aortic root.
  An invasive angiogram is also indicated for acute ischaemic cardiac pathology, particularly in the presence of ECG changes suggesting an acute myocardial infarction. Ideally this can then lead to endovascular stenting or clot-retrieval to open up the target artery. The procedure is obviously not without risk but can be life-saving, and is still considered as the gold standard for diagnosing coronary artery stenosis however the fact of stenosis does not provide information on the effect of the underlying myocardium. In the acute scenario it is reasonable to assume that a stenosed vessel is the cause of the symptoms but the picture is less straightforward in sub-acute or chronic chest pains.",True,"I chose 4 because MRI with delayed contrast is the best test to perform to confirm the diagnosis of myocarditis. This test can help to identify areas of inflammation and necrosis in the heart muscle, which are characteristic of myocarditis. In addition, MRI with delayed contrast can help to differentiate between myocarditis and other causes of chest pain, such as ischemia.",2,"3. A question about clinical decision making, what is the next best test?",A,True,"I chose option 4, MRI with delayed contrast, because it is the most appropriate test to confirm the diagnosis of myocarditis in this clinical scenario. 

Myocarditis is an inflammatory condition of the heart muscle, often caused by viral infections, which can present with symptoms similar to a myocardial infarction. An MRI with delayed contrast, also known as a late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) MRI, is a highly sensitive and specific imaging technique for detecting myocardial inflammation and fibrosis.

In this case, the patient has already undergone an ECG, troponin tests, and an echocardiogram, which have provided some evidence of myocardial injury. However, these tests are not definitive for myocarditis. An MRI with delayed contrast can help confirm the diagnosis by visualizing areas of inflammation and fibrosis in the heart muscle, which are characteristic findings in myocarditis.

The other options listed are not as appropriate for diagnosing myocarditis:
1. Invasive angiogram is primarily used to evaluate coronary artery disease, which is not the primary concern in this case.
2. Dobutamine stress MRI is used to assess myocardial ischemia and viability, but it is not specific for myocarditis.
3. Adenosine stress MRI is also used to evaluate myocardial ischemia, which is not the main concern in this scenario.

Of which of the following should you be most concerned?",SBA: Gastrointestinal,Ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm,Subcapsular haematoma,Parenchymal haemorrhage,Abscess,Bile leak,A,34%,48%,15%,2%,2%,"Explanation:
Acute haemorrhage has Hounsfield units of anything up to 80. Clinically the patientâs symptoms and the time frame fit well with haemorrhage. A major post-procedural haemorrhage three weeks after the biopsy would be unusual. The patient is the right age to have had an aneurysm.
Bile has Hounsfield Units very close to water. The liver produces a surprisingly large volume of bile and thus when a bile leak is present the patient can have significant abdominal distension with bile. Bile leaks typically present within the first week or two following a procedure.",False,"A subcapsular haematoma is the most concerning option in this case because it can cause severe and life-threatening complications. Subcapsular haematomas can cause compression of the liver, leading to decreased perfusion, shock, and even death. Additionally, a large and ill-defined collection of blood with a density of 80HU on a CT scan is highly suggestive of a subcapsular haematoma.",3,"3. A question about the management of a patient, what is the best course of action?

This question falls under Question 2: A question about clinical judgement, what is the correct diagnosis?",B,False,"I chose option 3 (Abscess) because the patient's presentation of tachycardia, hypotension, and a significant drop in hemoglobin, combined with the CT findings of a large ill-defined collection inferomedial to the liver with parts measuring 80 HU (Hounsfield Units), are suggestive of an abscess. An abscess is a collection of pus that has accumulated within a tissue due to an infection, and it can cause systemic symptoms such as fever, tachycardia, and hypotension. The high Hounsfield Units (80 HU) indicate that the collection is not a simple fluid (which would have lower HU values) but rather has a higher density, consistent with an abscess.

In this clinical scenario, an abscess is a more likely and concerning complication following a liver biopsy than the other options provided. A subcapsular hematoma or parenchymal hemorrhage would typically present earlier after the procedure and have different imaging characteristics.

Gonococcal infections classically cause long strictures. They are most commonly irregular in nature and located in the bulbous urethra.

For this question you would be forgiven for wanting Medullary carcinoma as an answer however since it has not been provided as an option the next best option is Papillary carcinoma since Follicular carcinoma is not associated with calcification (and is much less common).
Anaplastic thyroid cancer is usually in an older age range. Lymphoma also does not typically demonstrate calcification. In theory, metastases is âalwaysâ an unlikely option for a patient this young.",True,"The most likely diagnosis is papillary thyroid carcinoma. This is because the ultrasound findings of two nodules in the thyroid gland, enlarged cervical lymph nodes, and calcification within one of the lymph nodes are consistent with papillary thyroid carcinoma. Papillary thyroid carcinoma is the most common type of thyroid cancer, and these findings are typically seen in this type of cancer.",2,,A,True,"I chose Papillary thyroid carcinoma (option 5) as the most likely diagnosis for the following reasons:

1. Age: The patient is a 30-year-old woman, and papillary thyroid carcinoma is the most common type of thyroid cancer, particularly in younger patients.

2. Ultrasound findings: The presence of two nodules in the thyroid gland is consistent with the multifocal nature of papillary thyroid carcinoma.

3. Enlarged cervical lymph nodes: Papillary thyroid carcinoma frequently involves lymph node metastases, and the presence of several enlarged cervical lymph nodes (10-25mm) further supports this diagnosis.

4. Calcification: The slight calcification within one of the lymph nodes is another characteristic finding in papillary thyroid carcinoma, as it is known to have psammoma bodies (calcified structures) within the tumor and metastatic lymph nodes.

The CT demonstrates a large, heterogeneous, enhancing mass which fills the entire right hemithorax and is displacing the mediastinum to the left. No rib destruction is seen, despite the mass pressing against the chest wall. What is the most likely diagnosis?",SBA: Paediatrics,Pleuropulmonary blastoma,Askin Tumour,Ewings tumour,Neuroblastoma,Lymphoma,A,76%,8%,1%,11%,3%,"Explanation:
An extremely large hemithoracic mass in a 1-2-year-old child is almost always either an Askin tumour or Pleuropulmonary blastoma. Rib or bony involvement is the key differentiation feature. Pleuropulmonary blastoma does not cause rib destruction, whereas an Askin tumour would.
  Pleuropulmonary blastoma
This is a primary intrathoracic malignancy. It can resemble a Congenital Cystic Adenoid Malformation. They generally do not contain calcification and 'never' invade the skeleton. There is an association with multilocular cystic nephroma in around 10% of cases.
  Askin Tumour
These heterogenous tumours are part of the Ewing Sarcoma spectrum. Patients are often in their early teens. Askin tumours displace rather than invade adjacent mediastinal structures. Rib destruction is common and is a fact which can help distinguish it from a pleuropulmonary blastoma which is another cause of a large mediastinal mass, albeit usually found in children under the age of 2, but which does not cause rib destruction.
  Neuroblastoma
For a posterior mediastinal mass in a child under the age of 10, a neuroblastoma should be the top differential diagnosis to be considered. Usually it is heterogeneous with calcification and areas of necrosis.
  Lymphoma
This is the most common anterior mediastinal mass in children. It may be difficult to differentiate a lymphoma from normal thymus, particularly in a patient younger than 10 years of age. Associated lymphadenopathy (i.e. cervical) can be the key to distinguishing the two pathologies. Calcification is rare prior to any treatment but can be a feature of lymphoma which has been treated.",False,"Neuroblastoma is the most likely diagnosis because it is the most common solid tumor in children, and it typically presents with a large mass which fills the entire hemithorax and displaces the mediastinum to the left. Neuroblastoma can also cause rib destruction, although in this case it is not seen on the CT scan. Additionally, Neuroblastoma is typically seen in infants and young children, which fits the age of this patient.",2,,A,False,"I chose Askin Tumor (option 1) as the most likely diagnosis because the clinical presentation and CT findings are consistent with this type of tumor. Askin Tumor, also known as peripheral primitive neuroectodermal tumor (PNET) of the chest wall, is a rare and aggressive malignancy that typically affects children and young adults.

The patient's age (18-month-old boy) is consistent with the typical age range for Askin Tumor. The symptoms of general malaise, shortness of breath, and absent air entry in the right hemithorax suggest a large mass in the chest, which is confirmed by the CT findings. The large, heterogeneous, enhancing mass filling the entire right hemithorax and displacing the mediastinum to the left is a characteristic finding in Askin Tumor. Additionally, the absence of rib destruction despite the mass pressing against the chest wall further supports this diagnosis.

10121,205045,A 53-year-old man complains of back pain and is reviewed by an orthopaedic surgeon. He is otherwise fit and well. In the course of his management he eventually undergoes an MRI scan which shows a paraspinal mass adjacent to L1. There is amorphous calcification within the mass and on the contrast enhanced sequences the edge of the mass enhances strongly. What is the most likely diagnosis?,SBA: Musculoskeletal and Trauma,Pott disease,Pyogenic abscess,Scheuermann disease,Rhabdomyosarcoma,Parosteal sarcoma,A,64%,4%,3%,10%,19%,"Explanation:
Tuberculous spondylitis also known as Pott disease
Around half of patients have no pulmonary disease and spondylitis accounts for around 5% of all infections with tuberculosis. The L1 vertebral body is the most commonly affected level but usually more than one levels is affected. Within the vertebral body it is the anterior aspect which is affected first. This is thought to be due to the subligamentous spread of the bacterium, under the anterior longitudinal ligament. The disc height is usually preserved until relatively late on in the disease which can make the condition very difficult to detect on x-ray since neither periosteal reactions nor reactive sclerosis are likely to be seen either. Calcification to the disc is common though, and virtually pathognomonic when present.
  Phemister triad
Of articular tuberculosis it is the spine which is most commonly affected however the hips and knees can also be affected. The Phemister triad describes three classical features of tuberculous arthropathy which are common to all the joints affected:
Juxta-articular osteoporosis
Marginal erosions
Gradual reduction of the joint space
Differentiating tuberculous spondylitis from pyogenic spondylitis is crucial and there are a number of features which can help.
  Tuberculous discitis
Staphylococcal discitis
Calcification (almost pathognomonic)
No calcification
Involvement of the posterior elements
Posterior elements spared
Insidious onset
More acute onset
Less loss of disc space
More loss of disc space
Gibbus deformity (angular kyphosis)
No gibbus deformity
Multiple levels involved
One level involved
   ",False,"I chose number 5 because a parosteal sarcoma is a type of soft tissue sarcoma that is characterized by a slow growing, painless mass that is usually found in the paraspinal area near the spine.

10826,205045,"A 78-year-old man with a productive cough, fever and malaise undergoes a CXR. He is found to have a lobar pneumonia. What is the most likely responsible organism?",SBA: Cardiothoracic and vascular,Streptococcus,Rhinovirus,Staphylococcus,Mycoplasma,Haemophilus,A,77%,0%,15%,3%,4%,"Explanation:
There is considerable overlap in CXR appearances of pneumonia. Some trends can be seen but ultimately a sputum culture will lead to greater specificity. There are a number of different terms used to describe patterns that can arise.
  Lobar pneumonia
The presence of bacteria in the alveoli causes oedema there. The bronchi are usually spared however; hence the presence of air bronchograms on imaging. The most common cause is streptococcus pneumonia. Klebsiella can also occur and is seen particularly in alcoholic patients or those who may be immunocompromised.
  Bronchopneumonia also known as lobular pneumonia
Inflammation and oedema occurs within both the interstitium and the airways themselves giving a patchy fluffy appearance on a CXR. There is mucus plugging and volume loss (differentiating it from viral pneumonia). It occurs with staphylococcus as well as pneumococcus and klebsiella. Haemophilus would also give this appearance.
  Atypical bacterial pneumonia
Sometimes bacterial infections can give rise to a pneumonia which on a CXR resembles a viral pneumonia. This occurs with mycoplasma, among others.
  Viral pneumonia
Like bronchopneumonia the pathogens affect the airways and interstitium. Air trapping secondary to bronchial constriction occurs which gives rise to hyperinflation (differentiating it from bronchopneumonia). Viral pneumonias are commonly bilateral. Rhinovirus and RSV are common pathogens. Hyperinflation is a reasonably specific finding for viral pneumonias on a CXR. Appearances can be varied however with perihilar fluffy opacities or a more segmental appearance. Pleural effusions occur in around 20% of patients.
  Round pneumonia
This is a specific CXR appearance which occurs in young children. Organisms such as Haemophilus, pneumococcus or streptococcus which are the usual culprits for paediatric pneumonias, are contained by the limited facility for collateral drift; the pores of Kohn have not sufficiently developed to permit spread of the bacteria and consequently the pneumonia is relatively well contained. This gives rise to a rather spherical area, usually within the posterior aspect of the lobes.
  Cavitating pneumonia
Staphylococcus and streptococcus can both cause cavitation. Of the gram negative organisms, klebsiella and Haemophilus can cause cavitation.",True,"Streptococcus is the most likely responsible organism for lobar pneumonia in this age group. This is because Streptococcus pneumoniae is the most common cause of bacterial pneumonia in adults, and it is especially common in the elderly.",2,"This question falls under category 2: A question about clinical judgement, what is the correct diagnosis?",A,True,"I chose option 2, Streptococcus, because Streptococcus pneumoniae is the most common cause of lobar pneumonia, particularly in older adults.

Retrospective-gated scanning is helical in nature, not acquired in axial blocks.

Select ONE answer only.,SBA: Central Nervous and Head & Neck,Optic nerve glioma,Dermoid,Retinoblastoma,Mucocoele,Thyroid eye disease,A,78%,6%,4%,2%,11%,"Explanation:
The differential diagnosis for orbital pathology is heavily anatomically based.
  Image Â© Medical Exam Prep
  Globe lesions are situated within the eyeball itself.
Retinoblastoma
Melanoma
Retinal detachment
Outside the globe there are three conditions which are included in all of the other orbital compartments namely sarcoidosis, pseudotumours and lymphoproliferative lesions.
  Image Â© Medical Exam Prep
  Lymphoproliferative disorders include leukaemias, lymphomas, and less aggressive collections of lymphoid tissue. The term is used particularly in head and neck radiology where histological diagnosis of such entities is key. Some masses on a CT scan can have a 'typical' appearance for a lymphoma but are actually only benign lymphoid hyperplastic tissue and thus the term lymphoproliferative disorder covers both entities accurately.
IgG4 related diseases are one of Radiologyâs newest entities. They comprise a constellation of fibrotic conditions affecting virtually every part of the body, mediated by a subclass of Immunoglobulin called IgG4. Where one condition exists others may also be present. The more common of these include:
Orbital pseudotumour
Fibrosing mediastinitis
Reidel thyroiditis
Autoimmune pancreatitis
Sclerosing mesenteritis
Retroperitoneal fibrosis",True,"Optic nerve gliomas are tumors that arise from the glial cells of the optic nerve. They are most commonly seen in children, but can also occur in adults. The presence of a left intraconal lesion in a 45-year-old woman is suggestive of an optic nerve glioma, which is why this is the most likely diagnosis.",2,,A,True,"I chose option 4, optic nerve glioma, as the most likely diagnosis for a left intraconal lesion in a 45-year-old woman's brain. Intraconal lesions are those that occur within the cone-shaped space formed by the extraocular muscles, surrounding the optic nerve. Optic nerve gliomas are tumors that arise from the glial cells of the optic nerve and are commonly found within this intraconal space.

The other options are less likely due to the following reasons:

1. Dermoid: These are benign, slow-growing cystic lesions that typically occur in the orbit but are more commonly found in the extraconal space rather than the intraconal space.

2. Retinoblastoma: This is a rare malignant tumor that originates in the retina, usually in young children. It is not a common diagnosis in a 45-year-old woman.

3. Mucocoele: These are benign, mucus-filled cysts that occur in the paranasal sinuses, not within the intraconal space of the orbit.

Calcium pyrophosphate dehydrate disease (CPPD) also known as pseudogout
CPPD can present in an acute or subacute fashion but is also seen as a chronic cause of joint inflammation.

On examination, the A+E doctor notices he is unusually tall with pectus excavatum deformity and long fingers. An early diastolic murmur is heard on auscultation. He undergoes a CT scan and is found to have an aortic dissection. From where is the dissection most likely to have originated?",SBA: Cardiothoracic and vascular,Aortic root,Just distal to the right subclavian artery,Just proximal to the brachiocephalic artery,At the site of the ligamentum arteriosus,At the level of the diaphragm,A,78%,4%,3%,15%,0%,"Explanation:
The patient has Marfan syndrome which is an autosomal dominant connective tissue disease. Among other common features associated with this condition, the patient in this scenario is tall, with arachnodactyly and pectus excavatum. An early diastolic murmur suggests regurgitation, usually of the aortic valve but less commonly the pulmonary valve. Aortic regurgitation is another feature common to Marfan syndrome but although this may be present it would not necessarily explain his sudden chest pain. Patients with Marfan syndrome are at increased risk of developing aortic dissection compared to the general population.
Dissections are classified according to their involvement of the aortic root and their distal extent. There are two different classification systems. The Stanford classification is more useful clinically since the primary decision post-diagnosis is whether the dissection will be managed surgically or medically. Those involving the proximal aorta and arch are managed surgically. If the arch is not involved, the patient can be managed medically. Thus Stanford A dissections involve the aorta proximal to the origin of the left subclavian artery with or without concurrent distal involvement. Stanford B dissections do not involve the proximal aorta.
Most dissections originate just distal to the aortic valve and extend proximally, ie Stanford type A.
Traumatic aortic rupture is most likely to occur at the site of the ligamentum arteriosus, just distal to the origin of the left subclavian artery. This is termed the aortic isthmus. The proximal aorta is fixed by the ligamentum arteriosus but distal to this point the aorta is more freely mobile.
Coarctation of the aorta is associated with a late systolic or continuous systolic murmur.
Mitral stenosis gives a mid-diastolic murmur.
Rheumatic heart disease can affect any of the heart valves, although most commonly affects the mitral valve causing mitral stenosis.

13761,205045,An 18-month-old presents with abdominal enlargement and respiratory difficulty. The serum AFP is noted to be negative and endothelial growth factor is normal. A CT scan demonstrates a very large multicystic hepatic mass with no evidence of calcification. There is no evidence of any calcification or haemorrhage within the mass. What is the most likely diagnosis?,SBA: Paediatrics,Mesenchymal hamartoma,Neuroblastoma,Hepatocelluar carcinoma,Hepatoblastoma,Haemangioendothelioma,A,66%,3%,1%,15%,15%,"Explanation:
Mesenchymal hamartoma
This is a benign tumour which, if not detected antenatally, usually presents as a large abdominal mass in a neonate (later presentations do occur - 5% patients are >5 years old). Although benign, it's sheer size can cause significant respiratory compromise through diaphragmatic splinting. On imaging the majority of mesenchymal hamartomas are predominantly multicystic with enhancing septations present, but little in the way of added features such as calcification or haemorrhage. There is usually little internal colour doppler flow. AFP may be slightly raised but is usually normal, aiding further the distinction from a hepatoblastoma in particular.
  Haemangioendothelioma
This tumour is often described as causing high output heart failure (e.g. a large heart on CXR) plus a mass in the liver. The aorta proximal to the hepatic branches is usually enlarged. Endothelial growth factor is elevated.
  Hepatoblastoma
This is the most common primary liver tumour in infants under the age of 5. It is associated with Beckwith-Wiedemann Syndrome and prematurity. The serum AFP is elevated in 90% (markedly so) and calcifications are often present. Precocious puberty can be the presenting feature of this tumour.
  Hepatocelluar carcinoma
This is the second most common liver cancer in children. The serum AFP is usually elevated.
  Neuroblastoma
This is not a hepatic tumour but is a cause of a mass adjacent to the liver. It causes stippled calcification with encasement (rather than invasion) of vessels. Bone metastases are common.",False,"Hepatoblastoma is the most likely diagnosis in this case because it is the most common type of liver cancer in children. It is usually found in children under the age of three and typically presents with a large, multicystic hepatic mass with no evidence of calcification or haemorrhage. The absence of a positive AFP and normal endothelial growth factor levels further supports the diagnosis of hepatoblastoma.",2,,D,True,"I chose option 1, Mesenchymal hamartoma, as the most likely diagnosis based on the clinical presentation and imaging findings. 

An 18-month-old patient presenting with abdominal enlargement and respiratory difficulty suggests a large intra-abdominal mass. The negative serum AFP and normal endothelial growth factor levels help to narrow the differential diagnosis. 

The CT scan findings of a very large multicystic hepatic mass without calcification or hemorrhage are characteristic of a mesenchymal hamartoma. Mesenchymal hamartomas are benign liver tumors that typically occur in young children, often presenting with a rapidly enlarging abdominal mass. The multicystic appearance and lack of calcification or hemorrhage in the mass further support this diagnosis.

11536,205045,You are reviewing an MRI of the prostate. Which of the following best represents the usual findings in prostate cancer?,"SBA: Genito urinary, Adrenal, Obstetrics & Gynaecology and Breast","Low T2, Low ADC, High DWI","High T2, Low ADC, High DWI","High T2, High ADC, High DWI","Low T2, Low ADC, Low DWI","Low T2, High ADC, Low DWI",A,82%,10%,2%,1%,5%,"Explanation:
Prostate cancer
The vast majority of cancers of the prostate are adenocarcinomas and the risk of developing prostate cancer increases with age to such an extent that by the age of 80 approximately 80% of men will have some neoplastic foci within the prostate although these may be completely occult and never manifest clinically. Where the disease does advance it becomes one of the top three most common causes of death from cancer in men alongside lung cancer and colorectal cancer. Serum Prostatic Specific Antigen (PSA) levels have been used in prostate cancer screening since the 1990s.
MRI is crucial to provide accurate staging but is also gaining in momentum on its way to becoming a screening tool in its own right.
The majority of prostate cancers arise from the peripheral zone and causes the normally high T2 signal to become low signal. Additionally the cancer should show restriction in diffusion (ie high signal on DWI, correspondingly low on ADC). It is important to view the T1 images as well in order to exclude the possibility of haemorrhage which can sometimes look like a prostate cancer. The precise appearance of a haemorrhage changes depending on the timeframe.
  DWI + ADC
For a detailed explanation of DWI please use a more robust text than what follows. Readers should be warned that this is a very light glossing over of the concepts only.
Diffusion weighted imaging is the summation of both diffusion and T2 effects. The images must be interpreted in the light of findings on the corresponding ADC map which gives diffusion effects only. The more âunrestrictedâ the water molecules in a given substance are, the more diffusion takes place during the slice acquisition and the faster the dephasing of the magnetism. There are multiple ADC maps with increasing B-values to see how this dephasing responds. Usually you can pick out a DWI image because the CSF is black (aide memoire âDark Water Imagingâ).
Restriction of diffusion is a binary entity â things either restrict or they do not. The things that restrict diffusion are relatively limited in number and you would be well advised to learn them thoroughly for day to day practice as well as for the exams.
Cytotoxic oedema â failure of the cellular membrane ion pumps leads to an increase in intracellular (restricted) water
Acute infarction
As a stroke ages the DWI increases due to the T2 effect and the ADC becomes less bright through shine through. At approximately weeks 1-4 the ADC undergoes pseudonormalisation where restricted diffusion is matched by vasogenic oedema which is not restricted. Chronic infarctions do not restrict diffusion
Hypercellularity â Limiting the ability of extracellular water to diffuse
Some gliomas
Lymphoma
High viscosity
Abscess
Acute demyelination â a complex mechanism involving glutamate
ADEM
Acute MS
Elevated protein
Epidermoid cysts (technically due to waxy content as opposed to protein)
Subacute blood
T2 shine through â this is a pseudofinding of a bright lesion on the DWI image with a corresponding high signal area on the ADC map.",False,"I chose this option because it is the most typical pattern of findings seen in prostate cancer. High T2 signal intensity indicates increased cellularity and/or increased water content, and low ADC values indicate increased cellularity and/or increased diffusion restriction. High DWI values indicate increased cellularity and/or increased restriction of water diffusion. Together, these findings suggest the presence of prostate cancer.",1,"This question falls under category 1: Basic factual recall, either of basic science, physics, anatomy or regarding a procedure.",C,True,"I chose option 5 (Low T2, Low ADC, High DWI) because these are the typical MRI findings in prostate cancer. 

In prostate cancer, the tumor usually appears as a low signal intensity area on T2-weighted images, which is represented by ""Low T2"" in the options. 

Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps are derived from diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and are used to quantify the movement of water molecules within tissues. In prostate cancer, the movement of water molecules is restricted due to the presence of cancer cells, leading to a lower ADC value (""Low ADC"").

DWI measures the diffusion of water molecules in tissues. In prostate cancer, the diffusion of water molecules is restricted, resulting in a high signal intensity on DWI (""High DWI"").

Similarly, the presence of intra-ocular gas also implies a globe rupture.
A more subtle sign of globe rupture paradoxically includes an increase to the depth of the anterior chamber due to posterior displacement of the lens occurring in the context of a posterior segment rupture and subsequent loss of pressure there.
A coloboma is a focal defect in the posterior aspect of the globe with outpouching which can be quite striking in size. This is a congenital defect though, not a post-traumatic one. The finding can be unilateral or bilateral with the latter more suggestive of a syndromic association.
A staphyloma is a broader based defect in the globe, which can be located anywhere. It occurs due to degenerative thinning of the sclera and is seen as a smooth contour irregularity on cross-sectional imaging.",False,"Answer: 5. Shallow anterior chamber. A shallow anterior chamber is a specific sign of a globe rupture, as it indicates that the eye has been damaged, causing the anterior chamber to be filled with fluid, resulting in a shallow chamber.

13651,205045,You are reporting an x-ray of a 35-year-old man which shows a lucent lesion in the tibia. It is metaphyseal but extends into the epiphysis and is eccentrically placed within the bone. There is some expansion but no periosteal reaction. What is the most likely diagnosis?,SBA: Musculoskeletal and Trauma,Giant cell tumour,Intraosseous lipoma,Enchondroma,Malignant fibrous histiocytoma,Osteoblastoma,A,85%,2%,7%,2%,3%,"Explanation:
Giant Cell Tumour also known as osteoclastoma
These are benign bony tumours arising from within bone. They can cause bony expansion from within but not bony scalloping from without. Since they always occur in the mature skeleton they are seldom found in children or adolescent patients although the peak age group is still young; 30s. Typically they occur around the knee but can be found anywhere in the skeleton. They are seen on x-ray as expansile lytic lesions with the words âsoap bubbleâ often used to describe them in literature. On MRI they usually return low signal on both T1 and T2, in contrast to many of the potential differential diagnoses which would otherwise return high signal on one or the other.
  Four criteria of GCT (according to Clyde A. Helms)
After epiphyseal closure
Abuts articular surface
Well defined, non-sclerotic margin
Eccentric location
  Intraosseous lipoma
These benign lesions can present with pain but around a third of cases are diagnosed incidentally. The classic location for them is the calcaneum but they do occur all around the body. On x-ray they appear as a lucent bone lesion with a thin cortex and no periosteal reaction. Some show dystrophic calcifications. On MRI signal characteristics follow fat with high signal on T1 and signal loss on fat suppression sequences. The presence of granulation tissue can give high signal and calcifications, if present, will return low signal. On CT the fat within the lesion will show low/negative Hounsfield units.

  Enchondroma
As the name suggests, this is a cartilage forming tumour showing ground-glass matrix and ring or arc calcifications (as with all cartilage forming tumours). Patients are typically young (10-30 years) and the lesions are typically found in the hands (although they can form anywhere in the body. In the hands they are unusual to be found in the terminal phalanges). They are thought to derive from ongoing growth of small foci of cartilage which have become displaced from the growth plate. They can expand the cortex but, unless presenting as a fracture, should be painless and therefore are often an incidental diagnosis. Although they are benign tumours, malignant degeneration to a chondrosarcoma can occur.

  Malignant fibrous histiocytoma (MFH) - this is now known as undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma
A soft-tissue MFH is the most common subtype of MFHs and the most common malignant primary soft tissue tumour in the over 50s age bracket. It usually presents as a painless soft tissue mass which enlarges over a matter of months. They can be large at the time of diagnosis measuring tens of centimetres. On x-ray they appear as a partly calcified soft tissue mass. Cortical erosion of the underlying bone is an important diagnostic feature. 
  Osteoid osteoma
These are small benign tumours but which can be quite symptomatic, classically with pain relieved by aspirin. The majority form in the diaphyses of long bones but the posterior elements of the spine is another classic location.
The radiolucent nidus and symptoms of night pain in a young patient point to either an osteoid osteoma or an osteoblastoma. The final diagnosis comes down to size: <1.5 cm is definitely an osteoid osteoma, and >2 cm is definitely an osteoblastoma. There is a nasty grey area somewhere between the two sizes.
On x-ray the radiolucent nidus may not be fully appreciated, and the abnormality which is picked up will be the consequential sclerotic solid periosteal reaction. In the spine there may be a painful scoliosis concave towards the lesion as a result of adjacent muscular spasm. CT is used to confirm the diagnosis as the nidus is readily appreciable.

What would be the most sensitive test to confirm this finding?,SBA: Gastrointestinal,Labelled RBC Scan,Labelled WC Scan,MRI,Triple phase CT,USS,A,85%,12%,1%,2%,1%,"Explanation:
During this scan the patient is injected with stannous phosphate which enters the red blood cells and primes them for labelling with technetium. After 20 minutes, 20 ml of blood is taken out and combined with Tc99m pertechnetate. The blood is then heated to around 50oC for 35mins and then re-injected. The red blood cells damaged by this process are filtered out of the circulation by any normally functioning splenic tissue within the body.
Absence of uptake on imaging is consistent with asplenia.
An alternative scan which can also be performed is a Tc99m sulphur colloid scan.
  Splenosis
When there has been trauma to the spleen, tiny fragments can migrate around the peritoneal cavity, attach to structures and grow into larger collections of splenic tissue. On imaging these behave exactly as you would expect the normal spleen to for each modality. They can cause confusion if they are mistaken for peritoneal deposits.",False,"Triple phase CT is the most sensitive test to confirm the presence of splenosis because it can provide detailed images of the splenic tissue, which can then be compared to the patient's medical history and previous imaging results. This allows for the most accurate diagnosis of splenosis. Furthermore, triple phase CT can reveal the presence of any other abnormalities in the abdomen that may be related to the splenosis.",2,"3.

These nodules can sometimes be mistaken for other conditions, such as tumors.

A labelled RBC scan, also known as a Tc-99m-labelled heat-damaged red blood cell (RBC) scintigraphy, is a sensitive and specific test for identifying ectopic splenic tissue. In this test, the patient's own red blood cells are labelled with a radioactive tracer (technetium-99m) and then re-infused into the patient. The labelled RBCs are preferentially taken up by the ectopic splenic tissue, allowing for the identification of splenosis on imaging.

14589,205045,A 31-year-old lady with a history of cystic fibrosis presents with worsening shortness of breath and a cough. She underwent a bilateral lung transplant 8 years previously. She undergoes an HRCT and you suspect she may have bronchiolitis obliterans. Which of the following best describes the likely findings with this diagnosis? Select ONE answer only.,SBA: Cardiothoracic and vascular,Bilateral ground glass opacification with air trapping,Tree-in-bud changes and bronchiectasis in the right middle lobe,Upper lobe predominant tree-in-bud changes,Perilymphatic nodules and interlobular septal thickening,Perihilar opacification with pleural effusions,A,78%,8%,7%,5%,2%,"Explanation:
Bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome
There are two very similarly named syndromes which are completely different in aetiology  but frequently confused.
BOOP â bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia. This is the old term for what is now referred to as COP (Cryptogenic organizing pneumonia). There is patchy consolidation and ground glass opacification.
BOS â bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome. This is part of a CLAD (chronic lung allograft dysfunction).
In CLAD, a transplanted lung is not being rejected (another common misnomer) but the graft is undergoing fibrosis which causes respiratory dysfunction. The findings on CT, in the case of BOS, include mosaic attenuation with air trapping, bronchial wall thickening and bronchiectasis.
Post-transplant complications
The radiology of post-transplant lungs may be niche but it is important, particularly in the early post-operative days. Post-transplant complications can be, in an exam question setting at least, alluded to on the basis of their time frame.
  Time Complication Key CT findings (others may be present)
Hours Hyperacute rejection Unlikely to undergo CT
4-24 hours Reperfusion injury Perihilar (Batwing) opacification with small effusions
7-10 days Acute rejection Septal thickening with effusions
Weeks Drug toxicity Ground glass opacification
Months Lymphoid interstitial pneumonitis Ground glass opacification and centrilobular nodules
Any time Infections: Bacterial Aspergillus PCP Halo sign â pulmonary haemorrhage Black bronchus sign with perihilar ground glass or asymmetrical patchy opacification
  Other options:
Tree-in-bud changes and bronchiectasis in the right middle lobe - Mycobacterium avium complex
Upper lobe predominant tree-in-bud changes - Aspergillosis
Perilymphatic nodules and interlobular septal thickening - Sarcoidosis
Perihilar opacification with pleural effusions - Pulmonary oedema",False,"Upper lobe predominant tree-in-bud changes are the most common findings seen in bronchiolitis obliterans. This is because the disease tends to affect the small airways first, which are located in the upper lobes of the lungs. These changes are characterized by multiple small nodules or masses with an associated bronchial wall thickening, which give the appearance of a ""tree-in-bud"" pattern on the HRCT.",2,"3. A question about the interpretation of a test result?

2. A question about clinical judgement, what is the correct diagnosis?",A,True,"I chose option 1, ""Bilateral ground glass opacification with air trapping,"" because it best describes the typical findings of bronchiolitis obliterans on high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT). Bronchiolitis obliterans is a known complication of lung transplantation and is characterized by inflammation and fibrosis of the small airways, leading to their obstruction.

9481,205045,A 20-year-old woman who has spent much of the last three months lying in a body cast having sustained a spinal fracture during a road traffic incident develops intermittent abdominal pain and vomiting relieved by lying prone. You are asked to perform a barium follow-through study and this shows a vertical band-like narrowing at D3. Proximal to this point the duodenum is dilated and there is vigorous to and fro peristalsis. What is the most likely diagnosis?,SBA: Gastrointestinal,SMA syndrome,Ladd bands,Annular pancreas,Duodenal duplication cyst,Duodenal atresia,A,71%,24%,3%,1%,1%,"Explanation:
SMA syndrome
Vascular compression of the duodenum between the aorta and the SMA can be seen on a barium study. Dilatation proximal to the D3 segment is classical, as is the vigorous to and fro peristalsis within the proximal duodenum. Patients experience abdominal pain and vomiting, with symptoms being relieved by lying prone. Purportedly an angles of 10-20o between the SMA and aorta can cause this syndrome, with the normal angle being around 50o. There are a number of conditions which predispose to this syndrome, including: pregnancy, prolonged bed rest, and extensive weight loss.
  Ladd bands
Ladd bands are congenital peritoneal bands of fibrous tissues which join the (abnormally positioned) caecum to the liver, crossing the duodenum as they do so. They may not always cause problems but duodenal compression symptoms may arise. They can also be the root cause of a small bowel volvulus or internal hernia.
  Duodenal duplication cyst
Around quarter of duplication cysts occur in each of the ileum, oesophagus and colon (of these the ileum is the most common). The remaining quarter includes the stomach, jejunum and duodenum. A barium study may show a filling defect reminiscent of an extrinsic mass and if it is visible on ultrasound it would appear as a rounded or tubular cystic mass. For the most part however the diagnosis can be made on CT or MRI. The thin wall of the cyst may enhance slightly on CT and on MRI they will return high T2 signal, much as would be expected from a cystic structure.
  Annular pancreas
When the head and uncinate process of the pancreas (ventral pancreas) fail to migrate satisfactorily during embryological development they can fuse with the rest of the pancreas and encircle the duodenum. Around half of patients are diagnosed in childhood although the condition can remain asymptomatic and be picked up incidentally. In the neonatal period symptoms fit with duodenal obstruction and the classic âdouble bubbleâ can be seen on fluoroscopy where contrast media can flow through the pylorus into the D1 segment of the duodenum but no further. Most cases are associated with other congenital abnormalities such as trache-oesophageal fistula, malrotation or atresia of the duodenum or oesophagus and Down syndrome (i.e. single palmar crease, Brushfield spots) is also an associated syndrome.
  Duodenal atresia
This should be considered as a diagnosis in any young baby with upper GI symptoms. The x-ray will show no gas in the distal bowel but, counterintuitively, there is often aerobilia if the Sphincter of Oddi is proximal to the atrophic part. When there is air in both the stomach and proximal duodenum on an x-ray it is referred to as the double-bubble sign. There is a reasonably strong association with Down syndrome: around a quarter of cases of duodenal atresia will have Down syndrome.",False,"Ladd bands are the most likely diagnosis in this case. They are bands of fibrous tissue that form between the duodenum and the mesentery, the tissue that attaches the small intestine to the abdominal wall. These bands can cause obstruction, leading to abdominal pain and vomiting. The barium follow-through study would show a vertical band-like narrowing at D3, indicating the presence of Ladd bands. Proximal to this point, the duodenum would be dilated and there would be vigorous to and fro peristalsis, which are both common signs of Ladd bands.",2,,B,True,"I chose option 4, SMA (Superior Mesenteric Artery) syndrome, because the clinical scenario and radiological findings are consistent with this diagnosis. The patient has been in a body cast for an extended period, which could lead to significant weight loss and a decrease in the fat pad surrounding the SMA. This can result in compression of the third part of the duodenum (D3) between the SMA and the aorta, causing the vertical band-like narrowing seen on the barium follow-through study. Additionally, the patient's symptoms of abdominal pain and vomiting relieved by lying prone are classic for SMA syndrome, as this position can help alleviate the compression. The presence of a dilated duodenum proximal to the narrowing and vigorous to and fro peristalsis further supports this diagnosis.",A,True,A,True,"[{""page_content"": ""Annular pancreas is usually asymptomatic but may present with\nabdominal pain and vomiting, and barium meal demonstrates narrowing\nof the second part of the duodenum.

Select ONE answer only.,SBA: Central Nervous and Head & Neck,Sarcoidosis,Haemangioma,Retinoblastoma,Optic nerve glioma,Rhabdomyosarcoma,A,57%,27%,2%,3%,10%,"Explanation:
The differential diagnosis for orbital pathology is heavily anatomically based.
  Image Â© Medical Exam Prep
  Globe lesions are situated within the eyeball itself.
Retinoblastoma
Melanoma
Retinal detachment
Outside the globe there are three conditions which are included in all of the other orbital compartments namely sarcoidosis, pseudotumours and lymphoproliferative lesions.
  Image Â© Medical Exam Prep
  Lymphoproliferative disorders include leukaemias, lymphomas, and less aggressive collections of lymphoid tissue. The term is used particularly in head and neck radiology where histological diagnosis of such entities is key. Some masses on a CT scan can have a 'typical' appearance for a lymphoma but are actually only benign lymphoid hyperplastic tissue and thus the term lymphoproliferative disorder covers both entities accurately.
IgG4 related diseases are one of Radiologyâs newest entities. They comprise a constellation of fibrotic conditions affecting virtually every part of the body, mediated by a subclass of Immunoglobulin called IgG4. Where one condition exists others may also be present. The more common of these include:
Orbital pseudotumour
Fibrosing mediastinitis
Reidel thyroiditis
Autoimmune pancreatitis
Sclerosing mesenteritis
Retroperitoneal fibrosis",False,"I chose haemangioma as the most likely diagnosis because it is the most common type of benign tumor found in the brain. Haemangiomas are typically found in the extra-axial space, which is the space between the brain and the skull, making it the most likely diagnosis for a left extraconal lesion. Additionally, haemangiomas occur more commonly in adults than in children, making it a more likely diagnosis for a 45-year-old woman than the other choices.",2,,B,False,"I chose option 1, Haemangioma, as the most likely diagnosis for a left extraconal lesion in a 45-year-old woman's brain because:

1. Haemangiomas are benign vascular tumors that can occur in the orbit (eye socket) and are more common in middle-aged adults. The extraconal location of the lesion supports the possibility of a haemangioma.

2. Retinoblastoma (option 2) is a rare malignant tumor of the retina, typically affecting young children, not middle-aged adults.

3. Optic nerve glioma (option 3) is a rare tumor that arises from the optic nerve, which is usually an intraconal lesion. It is also more common in children and young adults.

4. Sarcoidosis (option 4) is a multisystem inflammatory disease that can involve the eyes, but it typically presents with intraocular inflammation and granulomatous uveitis, not an extraconal lesion.

5. Rhabdomyosarcoma (option 5) is a malignant tumor of skeletal muscle origin that can occur in the orbit. However, it is more common in children and adolescents.

This is a classical description for this tumour. Although predominantly a tumour of childhood situated in the lateral ventricles, when it does occur in adults it tends to be in the 4th ventricle. The overproduction of CSF by these tumours causes communicating hydrocephalus, hence ventricular dilatation and the symptom of uncontrollable crying with vomiting.
Ependymomas also occur in the paediatric cohort and are almost like an opposite to the choroid plexus papilloma in that ependymomas in children predominate in the 4th ventricle, show T1 hypointensity with foci of high T2 signal.

Here's a brief explanation of the findings and their correlation with the diagnosis:

1. Location: The mass is in the trigone of the left lateral ventricle, which is a common location for choroid plexus papillomas. These tumors arise from the choroid plexus epithelium.

2. Imaging characteristics on CT: The hyperdense mass with intense homogeneous enhancement, smooth and lobulated border, and small foci of calcification are typical features of choroid plexus papillomas.

3. Imaging characteristics on MRI: Isointensity on T1 and hyperintensity on T2 relative to the white matter, along with punctate foci of T2 hypointensity, are consistent with the diagnosis of choroid plexus papilloma.

4. Age of the patient: Choroid plexus papillomas are more common in children, especially in infants and young children under the age of 2 years.

5. Clinical presentation: Uncontrollable crying and vomiting in a 7-month-old patient may be related to increased intracranial pressure due to the mass effect and associated ventricular dilation.

11376,205045,Which of the following nuclear medicine agents should not be used in patients with renal failure? Select one answer only.,"SBA: Genito urinary, Adrenal, Obstetrics & Gynaecology and Breast",DTPA,DMSA,MAG3,MAG4,DMTA,A,62%,12%,14%,4%,8%,"Explanation:
Nuclear medicine comes into its own with renal medicine. There are various different options for various different scenarios.
  MAG3
Dynamic scan. Images every 2 mins for approximately 20 mins
MAG3 is a compound which has a high renal extraction rate and can be labelled with Tc99m. It provides an overview of the renal plasma flow. A normal unobstructed shows an initial increase in activity over 2 minutes as the tracer reaches the kidney followed by a slow decline in activity over around 20 minutes as it is filtered. An obstructed system will show a similar initial increase but activity will then not decline. Furosemide can be given to maximise the opportunity to show flow distal to the kidney. MAG3 is a safe agent to use in patients with renal failure.
  Captopril (an ACEi) can be given to diagnose renal artery stenosis as a cause of hypertension since the activity in a patient with renal artery stenosis will decline following administration of Captopril whereas a normal kidney will retain activity.
  Post-micturition images at 20 minutes can help to show the presence of residual bladder volume.
  DTPA â differential agent
Dynamic scan. Images at 1.5 second intervals for the first 30 seconds then less at 5 min intervals for 30 mins
Since DTPA is cleared only via the glomeruli it can be used to measure GFR. In a normal kidney the activity level peaks sharply followed by a decline which is initially rapid and then tapers off. As GFR worsens firstly the initial rapid decline becomes more gradual and with increasingly poor disease the initial peak then becomes diminished too. Ironically for a study used to measure GFR, DTPA is not a good agent for patients with renal failure; it can only be cleared via the glomeruli therefore if there is no glomerular filtration the agent will persist and lead to a high dose. Studies need higher doses than MAG3.
  DMSA â morphology and structure
Static scan. Image once at 2 hours.
DMSA is an excellent agent for evaluating the renal cortex. It is used a lot in the paediatric setting in the investigation of scars following pyelonephritis.",False,"MAG4 is a nuclear medicine agent that should not be used in patients with renal failure because it can cause further damage to the kidneys. MAG4 is a radiopharmaceutical that is used to measure the glomerular filtration rate, which can be impaired in patients with renal failure. The use of MAG4 in these patients can lead to further kidney damage due to the accumulation of radioactive material in the kidneys.",1,"This question falls under category 1: Basic factual recall, either of basic science, physics, anatomy or regarding a procedure.",D,False,"I chose DMSA (Dimercaptosuccinic acid) because it is a nuclear medicine agent that is primarily eliminated through the kidneys. In patients with renal failure, the impaired kidney function can lead to decreased clearance of the radiotracer, resulting in prolonged retention in the body and potentially causing increased radiation exposure. Additionally, the diagnostic accuracy of DMSA scans may be compromised in patients with renal failure due to the altered biodistribution of the tracer. For these reasons, DMSA is generally not recommended for use in patients with renal failure.",B,False,B,False,"[{""page_content"": ""function. Ultrasound was unremarkable.

11531,205045,A 64-year-old woman who is known to have had type 2 diabetes mellitus for many years is being investigated for recurrent urinary tract infections. A mid-stream urine specimen shows microscopic haematuria and she goes on to have a cystoscopy. At cystoscopy there are multiple bladder lesions measuring between 3-9mm in diameter which appear slightly raised from the mucosa and yellowish in colour. The findings are mirrored on an IVU which also shows filling defects in the distal right ureter. What is the most likely diagnosis?,"SBA: Genito urinary, Adrenal, Obstetrics & Gynaecology and Breast",Malakoplakia,Tuberculosis,Xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis,Leukoplakia,Schistosomiasis,A,76%,1%,5%,17%,2%,"Explanation:
Malakoplakia
Directly translated from Greek, malakoplakia just means soft plaques. These are actually submucosal inflammatory plaques consisting of basophilic PAS positive inclusion bodies and incompletely destroyed e-coli bacteria. The giveaway pathological term is Michaelis-Gutmann inclusion bodies which are the incompletely destroyed e-coli bacteria surrounded by a lipoprotein membrane. Although malakoplakia can occur in anyone, patients with diabetes mellitus or immunosuppression are predisposed to it. Importantly though, it is not a pre-malignant condition unlike leukoplakia. On imaging there are filling defects in the bladder and distal ureters. These are usually small, measuring only a few millimetres across.
  Xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis (XGP)
This curious condition results from chronic pyelonephritis and leads to a non-functioning kidney. Chronic infection (most commonly with Proteus or e-coli) induces a granulomatous process whereby the renal tissue eventually becomes replaced by a mass of reactive tissue. Since proteus infection is one of the main causes it is not surprising that many cases present with a staghorn calculus. The exact association varies from 30-90% depending on the data source. The other finding on CT is of multiple low attenuation rounded areas with Hounsfield Units (HU) of around -15 to -20. These are the dilated calyces filled with debris and xanthoma collections and they cause the whole kidney to be enlarged. The appearance is said to resemble a bearâs paw. Patients can present either on a background of recurrent UTIs or potentially renal colic. Vague malaise and weight loss may be the presentation in the absence of direct urinary symptoms.
  Schistosomiasis
Schistosome larvae burrow through human skin and travel via the lymphatics to the lungs and liver to mature. Thence they continue onto the pelvic vessels where eggs are deposited in the bladder wall. There the eggs cause both a granulomatous and an inflammatory reaction which erodes through the bladder mucosa and the eggs are then excreted in the urine. The disease is endemic to many parts of Africa.
The dominant imaging feature is of bladder wall calcification. This is usually described as curvilinear or floccular and involves all of the layers of the bladder. Owing to the chronic fibrotic reaction the bladder eventually becomes restricted and small; thus the standout imaging feature is of a small calcified bladder. The main differential diagnosis of bladder wall calcification is tuberculosis.
Another important facet to these cases is the risk of bladder cancer developing in the context of chronic inflammation. These cancers are squamous cell carcinomas and should be actively looked for in cases of schistosomiasis; there is a latent period of approximately 20 years prior to development.
  Renal tuberculosis
In areas of the world endemic to tuberculosis, renal tuberculosis is a reasonably common presentation of extra-pulmonary disease. The appearances on imaging vary depending on the disease timeline. The classical âputty kidneyâ of renal tuberculosis is an end-stage appearance where there is dystrophic calcification affecting all parts of the kidney. At this point the kidney has usually become shrunken and small and the final appearance is of so-called autonephrectomy when there is essentially no parenchymal tissue left, just amorphous calcification. An earlier manifestation is stenosis to the infundibuli connecting the calyces to the renal pelvis causing proximal dilatation of the calyces which are seen to be clubbed on a urogram. Purportedly, the earliest sign is of moth-eaten calyces owing to uneven erosion to the papillae.
  Leukoplakia 
Directly translated from Greek, leukoplakia just means white plaques. It is a squamous metaplastic condition affecting the transitional cell epithelium of the bladder. Presentation is usually as a consequence either of recurrent urinary tract infections or urinary tract calculi. Sometimes patients complain of passing flaky white tissue in the urine which is pathognomonic for this condition. On imaging there is mucosal thickening and filling defects within the bladder. Some sources consider leukoplakia to be a premalignant condition for epidermoid carcinoma.",False,"I chose 3. Xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis because it is a condition characterized by the presence of multiple bladder lesions that appear slightly raised from the mucosa and yellowish in colour. It is also associated with recurrent urinary tract infections, which is what the patient is being investigated for. Additionally, the IVU showed filling defects in the distal right ureter, which is a common symptom of xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis.",2,,A,True,"I chose Malakoplakia (option 5) as the most likely diagnosis because the clinical presentation and findings are consistent with this condition. Malakoplakia is a rare chronic inflammatory disorder that can affect the urinary tract, particularly in patients with a history of recurrent urinary tract infections and immunosuppression, such as those with diabetes mellitus.

Cryptogenic organizing pneumonia (COP) also known as Bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP)
COP is seen in patients post-infection, post-transplant, with a drug toxicity (chemo or methotrexate among others) or in an idiopathic setting. Patients experience a flu-like illness and a dry cough with worsening dyspnoea dating back over the preceding few months. Patients are often treated initially as a bacterial pneumonia and unsurprisingly there is then no response to antibiotic therapy. On CT there is patchy consolidation or ground glass opacification (GGO) and a third of patients will have pleural effusions or lymph node enlargement.
The reverse halo appearance is synonymous with COP (also known as BOOP â Bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia). It is seen as central ground glass opacification surrounded by a ring of consolidation. There are other conditions which can cause this appearance, of which the prominent ones are:
Wegeners granulomatosis
Sarcoidosis
Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia
    The halo sign
The halo sign is seen when there is a central nodule surrounded by ground glass opacification. It is almost as synonymous with invasive aspergillosis but is also seen in:

Septic emboli
TB

Select ONE answer only.,SBA: Central Nervous and Head & Neck,The head of the malleus is situated in the epitympanum,The short crus of the incus is situated in the mesotympanum,The Prussak space is found behind the inferior part of the tympanic membrane,The Eustachian tube opens into the mesotympanum,The stapes is connected to the malleus,A,66%,11%,6%,11%,5%,"Explanation:
The anatomy of the middle ear is complex but important and contains a number of specific anatomical terms.
  Image Â© Medical Exam Prep
  The epitympanum, also known as the attic, is the superior portion above the highest point of the tympanic membrane. It contains the head of the malleus and the short crus of the incus (These give the appearance of an ice-cream cone on an axial CT).
  Image Â© Medical Exam Prep
  The Prussak space is found within the epitympanum and is a tiny space at the top of the tympanic membrane, just behind the scutum. Its clinical relevance is that it is the usual origin for pars flaccida cholesteatomas.
The aditus ad antrum connects the epitympanum to the mastoid antrum and thence the mastoid air cells.
The tegmen mastoidium (tegmen means roof) is the point at which the mastoid air cells meet the temporal lobe of the brain.
The tegmen tympani is the point at which the upper most extent of the epitympanum reaches the temporal lobe of the brain.
    Image Â© Medical Exam Prep
  The mesotympanum is the space posterior to the tympanic membrane and contains the body of the incus, the manubrium (connected to the tympanic membrane) and the anterior process of the malleus and the stapes. The stapes is connected to the incus as well as the oval window of the cochlea. There is also a round window placed more inferiorly which bulges to allow compression waves transmitted from the stapes to the oval window to travel through the cochlea.
The hypotympanum is a far less significant space than either the epitympanum or the mesotympanum. It begins at the inferior most extent of the tympanic membrane. The Eustachian tube opens into the hypotympanum anteriorly.",True,"I chose this answer because it is correct according to anatomy. The head of the malleus is situated in the epitympanum, which is the middle ear cavity located between the tympanic membrane and the inner ear.

9041,205045,A 19-year-old woman complains of vague upper abdominal pain. She is initially managed conservatively but re-presents with the same complaint after a few weeks and an ultrasound scan is requested by her GP. This shows numerous cystic structures which converge on the porta hepatis and appear to be in communication with the bile ducts. The common bile duct is normal in calibre. What would be the most likely diagnosis?,SBA: Gastrointestinal,Caroli disease,Sclerosing cholangitis,Primary biliary cirrhosis,Cholecystitis,Cholangiocarcinoma,A,89%,4%,6%,1%,1%,"Explanation:
Choledochal cyst
Reflux of pancreatic enzymes into the common bile duct  leads to weakening of the wall of the common bile duct [CBD] (+/- the common hepatic duct) and thereafter aneurysmal dilatation termed a choledochal cyst. There are five different subtypes. Patients are mostly diagnosed in childhood.  If undiagnosed to adulthood patients present with a triad of episodic jaundice, right upper quadrant pain and a right upper quadrant mass.
Type I â This is by far the most common version. The common bile duct is affected either focally or along its entire length.
Type II â A true diverticulum of the CBD
Type III â Focal dilatation of the CBD contained within the wall of the duodenum. This type is also called a choledochocoele. They present slightly later with most patients being in their 30s at the time of diagnosis and can be seen as a duodenal filling defect on barium follow-through studies.
Type IV â The intrahepatic and extrahepatic biliary ducts are affected
Type V â The intraheptic ducts are affected alone. This is termed Caroli disease however there is some discrepancy in the literature as to whether this can be called a type V choledochal cyst or whether it is a separate disease in its own right. Caroli disease (cavernous ectasia of the intrahepatic ducts) can be inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion. When present it is quite striking on imaging with saccular dilatation of most of the larger intrahepatic biliary ducts alongside focal strictures giving a beaded appearance. There is an association with medullary sponge kidney and patients are at significantly increased risk of developing cholangiocarcinoma.
  Cholecystitis
When a gallstone becomes lodged in the neck of the gallbladder, chemical irritation from the trapped bile leads to inflammation of the gallbladder. Sometimes this can be felt by the patient as shoulder pain since irritation of the gallbladder is felt via C3, 4 and 5 the dermatomes of which cover the shoulder. Mostly, however, patients complain of right upper quadrant pain. With an accurate history this should be distinguishable from the pain caused by biliary colic, the latter being intermittent in nature and lasting less than six hours per episode.
On ultrasound the earliest signs will be of gallstones in the presence of a sonographic Murphy sign. Clinically Murphy sign is maximal tenderness when palpating over the gallbladder and the addition of ultrasound allows for greater specificity in this regard. The presence of pericholecystic fluid and increasing thickness of the gallbladder wall (>3mm) are also common findings, but come slightly later on. With CT similar findings can be seen with the addition of enhancement of the adjacent liver due to reactive hyperaemia. The presence of gallstones can be easily masked on CT since they are often of equal density to the bile.
Nuclear medicine tests would not usually be part of the index management of cholecystitis however can be used to determine cytic duct patency. Non-visualisation of the gallbladder at four hours following injection of 99mTc-HIDA is reported to be 99% specific in the diagnosis of cholecystitis.
Acalculous cholecystitis can also occur, often in the setting of an already unwell patient on ITU. It will present as generic sepsis and it is usually down to the clinical team to retain a high index of suspicioun. It is thought to be a consequence of low blood flow in the cystic artery.
Emphysematous cholecystitis signifies a gas-producing organism such as Clostridium or E-coli. Appearances are striking on imaging with ring-down or reverberation artefacts on ultrasound and mural gas seen on CT. Patients are typically (but not exclusively) diabetic or suffering from a debilitating condition. Unfortunately the mortality rate is significantly higher than for non-emphysematous cholecystitis.
Mirizzi syndrome can present as cholecystitis and occurs when the common hepatic duct is obstructed by the mechanical pressure of a stone within the cystic duct. It follows that patients whose cystic duct happens to insert low in the course of the common hepatic duct are predisposed to this condition.
  Cholangiocarcinoma
Any disease which causes chronic biliary inflammation predisposes the patient to developing cholangiocarcinoma, a malignancy of the biliary tree. In particular, inflammatory bowel disease poses a 10 times greater risk. Painless jaundice is the presenting feature in around one in ten patients but mostly patients present more insidiously with abdominal pain or weight loss.
Cholangiocarcinomas can be intra or extrahepatic and a few of the pertinent features of each are listed in the table below.
                   Extrahepatic                  
Intrahepatic
90% (Right > left)
10%
Fluctuating painless jaundice
Painful or painless jaundice, weight loss
Ductal strictures
Satellite nodules
  A Klatskin tumour is an intrahepatic tumour arising at the confluence of the left and right hepatic ducts where they join to form the common hepatic duct. Consequently it obstructs both ducts separately. On MRCP or ERCP this is seen as duct dilatation where the left and right ducts fail to communicate with one another. The location is relevant in identifying this type of tumours since they tend to be aggressive in nature, even for cholangiocarcinomas.
On ultrasound a cholangiocarcinoma can have a variable appearance. Duct dilatation, if present, should be evident. On CT the tumour will be hypodense but can show early rim enhancement with contrast, followed by filling-in leading to homogeneous delayed enhancement by around 15minutes. Thereafter there is washout which, again, begins peripherally. Appearances therefore depend hugely on the phase of the scan. Since cholangiocarcinomas do not derive from hepatocytes they do not take up sulphur colloid and thus will appear cold on a sulphur colloid scan.
  Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC)
Although benign in nature PSC can wreak havoc for patients unfortunate enough to develop it. It is twice as common in men as in women and 70% of patients have a history of inflammatory bowel disease. Bile duct strictures form (particularly at the bifurcation/confluence of ducts) and lead to an obstructive jaundice picture. In between strictures there is dilatation and the combination of the two leads to a string of beads type appearance. The appearance on ERCP or MRCP in some patients can also resemble a tree in winter with pruning of the upstream branches. Outpouchings also form which are either true or pseudo-diverticulae. Hepatic atrophy is present in chronic cases, although the caudate lobe is usually spared. Patients unfortunately have a higher risk of developing cholangiocarcinoma.
  Primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC)
This can be difficult to distinguish from PSC however whereas PSC can involve both intra and extrahepatic ducts, PBC only involves the intrahepatic ducts. It is an autoimmune condition and, like many other autoimmune conditions, patients are typically women in their middle ages. Antimitochondrial antibodies (AMA) are present in the vast majority of patients. On imaging, the secondary cirrhotic effects are most pertinent with caudate lobe hypertrophy and left lobar atrophy. The periportal halo sign as seen on MRI is reasonably specific and relates to fluid accumulation around the portal triad.
 ",True,"Caroli disease is a rare congenital disorder that is characterized by cystic dilations of the intrahepatic bile ducts. The cystic structures seen on the ultrasound scan, which converge on the porta hepatis and appear to be in communication with the bile ducts, are consistent with the findings of Caroli disease. Primary biliary cirrhosis, sclerosing cholangitis, cholecystitis, and cholangiocarcinoma are not likely to be the cause of the woman's symptoms based on the ultrasound findings.",2,,C,True,"I chose option 1, Caroli disease, because the clinical presentation and ultrasound findings are consistent with this diagnosis. Caroli disease is a rare congenital disorder characterized by multiple cystic dilatations of the intrahepatic bile ducts. The ultrasound findings mentioned in the question, such as numerous cystic structures converging on the porta hepatis and appearing to be in communication with the bile ducts, are typical features of Caroli disease. The normal calibre of the common bile duct further supports this diagnosis.

The other options are less likely due to the following reasons:

2. Sclerosing cholangitis: This condition typically presents with thickening and narrowing of the bile ducts, which is not consistent with the ultrasound findings in this case.

3. Primary biliary cirrhosis: This is an autoimmune disease that affects the small bile ducts in the liver and would not cause the cystic structures seen in the ultrasound.

4. Cholecystitis: This refers to inflammation of the gallbladder, which is not consistent with the described ultrasound findings of cystic structures in the liver.

Please note that the question asks which statement is NOT correct.
  Heterotaxy
There are two main forms of this congenital disorder:
Left sided isomerism (polysplenia)
Things that would usually be found on the left side are duplicated on the right side too. The most consistent features are the abnormalities of the spleen and IVC. The other features are commonly associated, but variably seen. The prognosis is slightly better than for asplenia syndrome as there is a lower association with congenital heart disease. There is still 75% mortality by age 5 though.
Spleen - multiple little spleens
IVC - interrupted IVC with azygos or hemiazygos continuation
Lung lobes - two on either side
Liver - situated centrally in the abdomen
Bowel - malrotation
Pancreas - truncated
Heart - ASD, VSD, PAPVR (less severe congenital heart disease)
  Right sided isomerism (asplenia)
Things that would normally be found on the right side are duplicated on the left side too. Strong association with severe congenital heart disease means the condition has a mortality rate of 80% by age 1. Beyond that, the most consistent feature is the absence of the spleen. Once again, the other features are commonly associated, but variably demonstrated.
Heart - TAPVR and other anomalies (Almost 100% have severe cyanotic congenital heart disease)
Spleen - absent
Lung lobes - three on either side (specific finding)
Liver - normal position (can be midline or malpositioned)
Bowel - malrotation
IVC - on same side as aorta (usually the right)
Kidneys - associated with horseshoe kidney",False,"Asplenia is associated with more complex cardiac anomalies than polysplenia, and these cardiac anomalies can lead to poorer prognosis than polysplenia. Patients with asplenia are more likely to have more severe cardiac defects and complications, such as single ventricle physiology, and this can lead to higher morbidity and mortality rates. Additionally, patients with asplenia are more likely to require multiple surgeries and other interventions to manage their condition, which can also lead to poorer prognosis than polysplenia.",1,"3. A question about clinical decision making, what is the best course of action?

This question falls under category 1: Basic factual recall, either of basic science, physics, anatomy or regarding a procedure.",D,False,"I chose option 4 because it states that ""Asplenia is associated with a horseshoe kidney,"" which is NOT correct. Heterotaxy syndrome is a rare congenital disorder that involves the abnormal arrangement of internal organs. It can be classified into two main types: asplenia (absence of a spleen) and polysplenia (multiple spleens).

14141,205045,A 6-year-old boy swallows a coin and is brought in by his parents with abdominal pain. An X-ray is performed that shows the coin is lodged in the region of the gastroesophageal junction. Which region of the stomach does the oesophagus open into? Select ONE answer only.,SBA: Gastrointestinal,The cardia,The fundus,The body,The pylorus,The lesser curvature,A,83%,10%,4%,1%,2%,"Explanation:
The stomach is a J-shaped digestive organ that lies in the superior aspect of the abdomen between the oesophagus and the duodenum.
  It has four main regions:
The cardia â which is around the opening of the oesophagus
The fundus â which is the dilated superior portion lying beneath the left dome of the diaphragm
The body â which is the large central position lying between the fundus and the pylorus
The pylorus â which is the lower portion that facilitates the emptying of its contents into the duodenum
  The medial and lateral borders of the stomach are curved, forming the greater and lesser curvatures of the stomach:
The greater curvature â forms the longer, convex, lateral border of the stomach. The greater omentum arises from it.
The lesser curvature â forms the shorter, concave, medial border of the stomach. The lesser omentum arises from it.
  There is a sharp indentation two-thirds of the way along the lesser curvature called the angular notch. This point marks the junction of the body and the pylorus.
  Food boluses enter the stomach via the lower oesophageal sphincter. Once within the stomach protein digesting enzymes, such as pepsin, are released. Hydrochloric acid within the stomach provides a suitably acidic pH for these enzymes to work and also serves to kills bacteria. The food boluses are churned up by peristaltic contractions of the wall and converted into chyme. The passage of chyme into the duodenum is controlled by the pyloric sphincter, which lies between the pylorus and the duodenum.
   ",True,"I chose number 2 because the gastroesophageal junction is the area where the oesophagus opens into the stomach.

11491,205045,A 65-year-old man receives an incidental diagnosis of an adrenal lesion when he undergoes a CT scan for his abdominal aortic aneurysm. The lesion measures 80HU on both the enhanced and unenhanced images. He goes on to have an MRI on which the lesion returns high signal on both T1 and T2 but is dark on the T2 GRE sequence. What is the diagnosis?,"SBA: Genito urinary, Adrenal, Obstetrics & Gynaecology and Breast",Haemorrhage,Angiomyolipoma,Myelolipoma,Protein rich cyst,Waterhouse-Friderichsen syndrome,A,70%,9%,9%,7%,5%,"Explanation:
This question is a little ambiguous. The imaging findings allude do to haemorrhage but the underlying lesion could be any potential adrenal lesion, including a myelolipoma. It is not possible to distinguish that on the basis of the information given.
Adrenal haemorrhage can be unilateral or bilateral, traumatic or non-traumatic. Around 20% of unilateral adrenal haemorrhage occurs in a non-traumatic setting. Physiological stress increases adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) and this acts on the adrenal glands to increase vascularity the better to secrete adrenaline. An unfortunate side effect is the propensity for intraglandular haemorrhage. Any one of a number of situations can lead to sufficient stress to cause this but the usual culprits are:
Surgery
Sepsis (aka Waterhouse-Friderichsen syndrome)
Burns
Hypotension
Pregnancy
Birth trauma
Outside of a response to stress, coagulopathies and anticoagulant therapies naturally also confer a risk of adrenal haemorrhage. Haemorrhage can occur spontaneously in a pre-existing adrenal lesion as well.
  Timeframe
MRI findings
Acute
7 days
Very low on T2
Subacute
7 weeks
High signal on T1 + T2
Chronic
> 7 weeks
Low signal rim on T1 and T2 (haemosiderin deposition + fibrous capsule)
  An acute presentation is more likely with bilateral haemorrhage owing to the concurrent adrenal insufficiency this is likely to herald however if imaging is performed for the index cause then unilateral haemorrhage may also be detected. Within the first week the haemorrhage will be seen as high attenuation on CT (50-90HU). Thereafter the Hounsfield units will decline as the blood degrades. Most will go on to complete resolution but adrenal calcification is a known long-term consequence of adrenal haemorrhage. The MRI findings relate closely to the timeframes involved and are depicted in the table.
  GRE sequences
Gradient echo sequences are used in conjunction or instead of spin-echo sequences in some circumstances. They do not encompass a 180o refocusing pulse and as such are far more susceptible to the effects of T2* as well as the dephasing effects of paramagnetic iron in haemorrhage. Consequently, if something is dark on GRE sequences this is often a strong indicator of haemorrhage of some description.
  Waterhouse-Friderichsen syndrome
This is the name given to adrenal insufficiency when it occurs as a consequence of bilateral adrenal haemorrhage in the context of sepsis.",False,"Angiomyolipoma is the most likely diagnosis based on the imaging findings. This is because the lesion is hypodense on the CT scan (80HU), and it returns high signal on the T1 and T2 sequences of the MRI, but is dark on the T2 GRE sequence. This is consistent with the characteristics of an angiomyolipoma, which is a benign tumor composed of fat, smooth muscle, and blood vessels.",2,,B,False,"I chose Angiomyolipoma because the imaging findings described are consistent with this diagnosis. Angiomyolipomas are benign tumors that contain a mixture of blood vessels, smooth muscle, and fat. They are commonly found in the kidneys but can also occur in the adrenal glands.

The CT scan findings show that the lesion has a high attenuation value of 80 Hounsfield Units (HU) on both enhanced and unenhanced images, which suggests the presence of fat within the lesion. This is a characteristic feature of angiomyolipomas.

The MRI findings also support the diagnosis of angiomyolipoma. The lesion demonstrates high signal intensity on both T1 and T2-weighted images, which is consistent with the presence of fat. Additionally, the lesion appears dark on the T2 gradient echo (GRE) sequence, which suggests the presence of microscopic fat or hemorrhage, both of which can be seen in angiomyolipomas.

The other options listed are less likely based on the imaging findings:

2. Haemorrhage: While hemorrhage can cause high signal intensity on T1-weighted images, it would not typically cause high signal intensity on T2-weighted images or have high attenuation on CT.

3. Myelolipoma: Myelolipomas are also benign adrenal tumors containing fat and hematopoietic tissue. However, they usually have lower attenuation on CT and would not typically appear dark on T2 GRE sequences.

4. Protein rich cyst: Protein-rich cysts would not have high attenuation on CT, and their MRI signal characteristics would be different (low signal on T1 and high signal on T2).

5. Waterhouse-Friderichsen syndrome: This is a rare, life-threatening condition characterized by adrenal gland hemorrhage due to septicemia. It would not present as an incidental adrenal lesion with the imaging findings described.",B,False,E,False,"[{""page_content"": ""CT (FIGURE 4.14a,b)\n\u25cf\u25cf\nSoft tissue adrenal mass, homogeneous enhancement, prone to haemorrhage (then \nappears heterogeneous)\n\u25cf\u25cf\nMay have peripheral calcification\nMRI\n\u25cf\u25cf\nHyperintense on T2, may have areas of T1 hyperintensity from previous haemorrhage\n\u25cf\u25cf\nEnhancement as for CT (however, flow voids may be apparent\u2014salt and pepper \nappearance)\nNUCLEAR MEDICINE\n\u25cf\u25cf\nMIBG is most sensitive for the detection of extra-adrenal disease and metastases."", ""metadata"": {""source"": ""source_documents\\Vincent Helyar, Aidan Shaw - The Final FRCR_ Complete Revision Notes-CRC Press (2018).pdf"", ""file_path"": ""source_documents\\Vincent Helyar, Aidan Shaw - The Final FRCR_ Complete Revision Notes-CRC Press (2018).pdf"", ""page"": 277, ""total_pages"": 483, ""format"": ""PDF 1.5"", ""title"": ""The Final FRCR: Complete Revision Notes"", ""author"": ""Vincent Helyar and Aidan Shaw"", ""subject"": """", ""keywords"": """", ""creator"": ""Adobe InDesign CC (Windows)"", ""producer"": ""Adobe PDF Library 10.0.1"", ""creationDate"": ""D:20170918203950+05'30'"", ""modDate"": ""D:20170922154202+05'30'"", ""trapped"": """"}}, {""page_content"": ""normal.

13749,205045,A 7-year-old girl is found to have high blood pressure during a routine school check. She is investigated and her chest x-ray shows a figure of 3 sign. Echocardiography confirms a diagnosis of coarctation of the aorta. Which of the following is most commonly seen in association with coarctation of the aorta?,SBA: Paediatrics,Patent ductus arteriosus,Ventricular septal defect,Atrial septal defect,Turner syndrome,Truncus arteriosus,A,39%,10%,9%,39%,3%,"Explanation:
Coarctation
A congenital narrowing of the aorta at the level of the ductus arteriosus is known as coarctation. This can present neonatally when the point of stenosis is preductal. This means the body and lower limbs are supplied primarily via a patent ductus arteriosus. When coarctation presents later, even in adulthood, the point of stenosis is usually post-ductal with established collateralization via the subclavian and intercostals arteries. It is this collateral pathway which gives rise to the rib notching seen on a CXR.
Rib notching is due to chronic bony remodeling and it takes until around the age of 20 for it to become radiologically evident. Of note the intercostal arteries to the first and second ribs arise from the costocervical trunk and therefore the first and second ribs do not show rib notching. Furthermore should the patient have an aberrant right subclavian artery (ARSCA) as well as coarctation they will only demonstrate rib notching on the left side since the ARSCA originates distal to the stenotic point.
The other specific CXR sign associated with coarctation is the âfigure of 3â sign which refers to the contour of the descending aorta.
Coarctation of the aorta, like most of the other congenital cardiovascular abnormalities, has the usual sprinkling of associations. At least half of patients have a bicuspid aortic valve. As well as PDAs, VSDs are also common. There is a particular association with Turner syndrome (45, XO).
  Associations:
Bicuspid aortic valve - 50%
PDA - 33%
VSD - 15%
Turner syndrome - 15%
Others - ASD, DORV, truncus arteriosus, berry aneurysms

There are a number of specific differential diagnoses which can lead to this finding. In each case the image should be interrogated carefully to look for further clues as to the underlying diagnosis. Scalloping is a chronic process whereby mechanical pressure on the bone causes remodelling.

The urographic phase shows multiple filling defects within both ureters. What is the most likely explanation?,"SBA: Genito urinary, Adrenal, Obstetrics & Gynaecology and Breast",Pyeloureteritis cystica,Gas,Metachronous TCC,Multiple SCC,Blood clots,A,39%,24%,31%,1%,5%,"Explanation:
Pyeloureteritis cystica
This condition causes the formation of numerous small fluid-filled submucosal cysts as part of a hyperplastic transitional cell response to chronic urinary tract infections. Elderly and diabetic patients are therefore predisposed to developing the condition. The cysts show up as filling defects within the proximal ureters on a CT urogram. They can be found in the bladder and renal pelvis in addition to the ureters but are most frequently encountered in the proximal ureters.
  Differential diagnosis for multiple filling defects in the ureters
TCC
Blood clots
Leukoplakia
Calculi (Steinstrasse)
Pyeloureteritis cystica
Locules of gas
  Ileal conduit
Ileal conduits are best imaged either by CT urography or retrograde as a so-called loopogram (also known as a conduitogram). It is common to see some foci of gas within the ileal conduit following the surgery but less common (although by no means impossible) for the gas bubbles to track into the ureters. Gas on a CT scan is usually sufficiently distinct to differentiate it as a cause of the filling defects.

What is the most likely diagnosis?,SBA: Central Nervous and Head & Neck,Sagittal sinus thrombus,Posterior reversible encephalopathy,Glioblastoma multiforme,Lymphoma,Sarcoidosis,A,85%,12%,1%,1%,1%,"Explanation:
Dehydration secondary to a diarrhoea and vomiting bug is a known cause of sagittal sinus thrombosis. The FLAIR high signal pertains to acute infarctions caused by the thrombosis. The other diagnoses listed are reasonable enough (to a greater or lesser extent) but do not account for the diarrhoea and vomiting bug being included in the history. A sagittal sinus thrombosis can present with seizures.",False,"I chose this answer because posterior reversible encephalopathy (PRES) is a common cause of seizures in young adults and is characterized by high signal on FLAIR in the parasagittal cortex bilaterally. It is usually caused by a sudden increase in blood pressure or other systemic insults such as sepsis, chemotherapy, or immunosuppression. The patient's history of a diarrhoea and vomiting bug suggests that they may have had a systemic insult that triggered the PRES.",2,,B,False,"I chose option 1, Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome (PRES), because the clinical presentation and MRI findings are consistent with this condition. The patient's symptoms of diarrhea, vomiting, and lethargy, followed by an acute seizure, suggest a possible electrolyte imbalance or other metabolic disturbance. The MRI finding of high signal on FLAIR in the parasagittal cortex bilaterally is also consistent with PRES, which typically presents with vasogenic edema in the subcortical white matter, often in a symmetric pattern.

PRES is a neurological disorder that can be caused by various factors, such as hypertension, renal failure, autoimmune diseases, and certain medications. It is characterized by a rapid onset of symptoms, including headache, seizures, altered mental status, and visual disturbances. The condition is called ""reversible"" because, with prompt diagnosis and treatment, most patients can recover fully.

The other options are less likely based on the clinical presentation and imaging findings:

2. Glioblastoma multiforme is an aggressive brain tumor, but it typically presents with a more insidious onset of symptoms and would not cause the bilateral symmetric MRI findings described here.
3. Lymphoma can involve the central nervous system, but it would not typically present with the acute symptoms and symmetric MRI findings seen in this case.

The principle of mammography and ultrasound is not diagnosis, although at times both will suggest a diagnosis. Their role is to guide further management, hence the grading system (R1-5, U1-5). A suspicious lesion on either mammography or ultrasound must receive a tissue diagnosis (assuming the patient is appropriate for and amenable to such).
Ultrasound guided biopsies would be essentially blind-biopsies since the lesion cannot be seen on ultrasound. Since the lesion can be seen on mammography, a stereotactic biopsy (i.e. a mammography guided biopsy) is the next best option. An MRI may be performed in due course, however a tissue diagnosis (whether benign or malignant) is what is ultimately required for this lesion. Similarly re-imaging may be appropriate as well but will not provide a tissue diagnosis.",False,"Surgical excision is the most appropriate next step of management in this case because the lesion is impalpable and the ultrasound of the breast reveals no abnormality.

The silhouette (pronounced as: sil-o-wet) sign has a leading role in the interpretation of chest xrays. It occurs when two structures are adjacent to one another and it is therefore not possible to see where one begins and the other ends on a CXR. In order to see all the way around any structure it must have a difference in density between it and any structure touching it; this is called âcontrastâ. The silhouette sign is useful because it can be used to define the anatomical location of pathology.

This sign makes use of the silhouette sign to determine whether a central mass on a CXR arises from the hilum as opposed to either the anterior or posterior mediastinum. If the hilar vessels can be visualized through or against the mass then there must be lung separating the mass from the hilum; hence it must be in either the posterior or anterior mediastinum. If the vessels cannot be seen then the mass must be in contact with the hilum.",False,"The left heart border is the most likely finding in-keeping with a left upper lobe collapse because the left heart border will be obscured or flattened due to the collapse of the left upper lobe.

14313,205045,You are performing an ultrasound scan on a 27-year-old lady. She has presented with severe abdominal pain and is on day 7 of her menstrual cycle. You suspect she may have ovarian torsion. Which of the following regarding this diagnosis is NOT correct? Select ONE answer only.,"SBA: Genito urinary, Adrenal, Obstetrics & Gynaecology and Breast",The most common cause of ovarian torsion is a tubo-ovarian abscess,The diagnosis is not excluded by the presence of doppler flow in the ovary,The ovary will be larger than normal,Small fluid pockets seen around the edge of the ovary are in-keeping with the diagnosis,Torsion is more common during early pregnancy,A,75%,4%,2%,9%,10%,"Explanation:
Please note that the question asks which answer is NOT correct.
  Ovarian torsion
At least half of all ovarian torsion is caused by a lead point (i.e. an ovarian mass). Most cases are due to a corpus luteum cyst or follicular cyst with a dermoid cyst being the next most common cause. Torsion is also more common during early pregnancy than in non-pregnant patients. On ultrasound the ovary itself will be enlarged (>4cm in length), and heterogenously echogenic. In the periphery of the ovary, small fluid-filled follicles may be appreciated. On doppler ultrasound scan, twisting of the ovarian pedicle is a useful sign but actual flow within the ovary itself does not exclude torsion since it is venous flow which is lost first.
Symptoms may resolve spontaneously with de-torsion but otherwise laparoscopy is indicated to de-tort the ovary and remove any lead point. If the ovary is infarcted at the time of surgery this will also be resected.
  Mature teratoma
(Immature) teratomas and dermoid cysts (mature teratomas) have very similar imaging characteristics despite their histological differences. Teratomas are the most common ovarian neoplasm but are slow growing and usually benign. By contrast immature teratomas are malignant. The presence of fat is a strong indicator for a mature teratoma with the combination of fat, fluid and calcification being highly specific. On MRI the fat will show the usual signal drop-out on fat saturated sequences. Calcification will show as low signal on T2. Although benign, mature teratomas can be complicated by torsion or rupture. Malignant degeneration if it does occur, is to squamous cell carcinoma most commonly.
Mature teratomas can have a variety of appearances on ultrasound scan depending on their internal composition. Posterior acoustic shadowing suggests the presence of calcification.
  The corpus luteum
The corpus luteum consists of the remnant of a ruptured ovarian follicle following ovulation. It produces oestrogen and progesterone to sustain a pregnancy following fertilisation. On ultrasound it is seen as a thick-walled cyst with peripheral vascularity on colour Doppler flow. This 'ring of fire' appearance can be confused with an ectopic pregnancy.",False,"I chose this answer because ovarian torsion is more likely to occur during the pre-ovulatory and ovulatory phases of the menstrual cycle, not during early pregnancy. During early pregnancy, the ovary is larger than normal due to increased blood flow and hormonally-induced changes, which would make it less likely to be affected by torsion.",1,"3. A question about clinical decision making, what is the best course of action?

This question falls under 3. A question about clinical decision making, what is the best course of action?",C,True,"I chose option 4 because it states that ""the most common cause of ovarian torsion is a tubo-ovarian abscess,"" which is NOT correct. The most common cause of ovarian torsion is actually an ovarian mass or cyst, which can lead to an imbalance in the ovary's position and cause it to twist. A tubo-ovarian abscess is an infection involving the fallopian tubes and ovaries, and while it can cause severe abdominal pain, it is not the most common cause of ovarian torsion.",A,False,D,True,"[{""page_content"": ""PAEDIATRICS | QUESTIONS\n212\n73.

14581,205045,"A 45-year-old lady is being investigated for atypical chest pains which she has been experiencing for the last two months. She is worried as she has a strong family history of heart problems. She undergoes a 24-hour ECG which is normal, but an exercise ECG shows some lateral T-wave inversion. Which of the following is the next best test to perform? Select ONE answer only.",SBA: Cardiothoracic and vascular,Adenosine stress MRI,Cardiac CT,Dobutamine stress MRI,Stress echo,Invasive angiogram,A,49%,20%,20%,8%,4%,"Explanation:
This lady is showing some signs of myocardial ischaemia during exercise. The best modality to image this and demonstrates the extent of the territory involved would therefore be a stressed test. The best test for this would be an adenosine stress MRI.
  Adenosine stress MRI has overtaken dobutamine stress MRI in terms of sensitivity and specificity for investigating the presence of ischaemia or infarction. Adenosine causes coronary vasodilation. If there is a haemodynamically significant stenosis to a coronary vessel, the vessels distal to the stenosis are already maximally dilated to maximise flow and thus the application of adenosine makes no difference to the vessel calibre or the resultant perfusion. Furthermore, the vasodilatation to the remaining unoccluded vessels can 'steal' blood from the stenosed territory and this is seen as hypoperfusion to the affected territory. Dipyridamole (antiplatelet), blocks uptake of adenosine and so patients taking this are also poor candidates for this test, however dipyridimole itself can also induce vasodilatation so may be used as an agent in its own right instead of adenosine. 
Contraindications to adenosine include:
Second or third degree heart block
Bronchospasm
Hypotension <90mmHg systolic
Myocardial infarction within 48hrs
Uncontrolled arrhythmia
Severe/critical aortic stenosis
The half-life of adenosine is exceptionally short, around 10 seconds, thus any side effects experienced during the scan resolve very quickly. It also means that during the scan, in order to maintain the effect, the adenosine must be given as an infusion.
  Dobutamine stress MRI used to be used but has largely been superseded by adenosine stress MRIs. Dobutamine is a sympathomimetic so works by inducing the heart to beat both faster and stronger. By increasing the stress on the whole heart, hitherto compensated areas are unmasked. The drug is given at increasing doses ever 3 minutes until any of:
The heart rate has increased to around 85% of its resting maximum
New wall motion abnormality is seen
Blood pressure rises above 240/220mmHg
Systolic blood pressure falls by 40mmHg
The patient develops persistent arrhythmias
The patient becomes too symptomatic to continue the scan
Aside from the usual contra-indications to performing the MRI in the first place, specific contra-indications to performing a dobutamine stress MRI include:
Hypertension >220/120mmHg
Unstable angina
Aortic stenosis (severe)
Uncontrolled atrial fibrillation
Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy
Congestive heart failure
  A stress echocardiogram is particularly useful for further investigating patients in whom a stress ECG was inconclusive. Many patients are unable to tolerate the physical demands (treadmill) of a stress ECG. Patients are given dobutamine, much like for a stress cardiac MRI study. Wall-motion abnormalities can be seen, as with cardiac MRI, and these correspond to areas of non-viable or hibernating myocardium and provide targets for revascularisation. An echocardiogram has the obvious advantages of lower cost, wider availability and faster scanning time than an MRI. The contra-indications to this test are the same as those for cardiac MRI.
Cardiac CT is indicated for acute cardiac or major vessel pathology as it is quick and more readily available than MRI. It can be used to assess the calcium-score of the coronary arteries as well as patency/occlusions to identify targets for acute revascularisation. It is also useful for quantifying aneurysmal dilatation of the aortic root.
  An invasive angiogram is also indicated for acute ischaemic cardiac pathology, particularly in the presence of ECG changes suggesting an acute myocardial infarction. Ideally this can then lead to endovascular stenting or clot-retrieval to open up the target artery. The procedure is obviously not without risk but can be life-saving, and is still considered as the gold standard for diagnosing coronary artery stenosis however the fact of stenosis does not provide information on the effect of the underlying myocardium. In the acute scenario it is reasonable to assume that a stenosed vessel is the cause of the symptoms, but the picture is less straightforward in sub-acute or chronic chest pains.",False,"Invasive angiogram is the next best test to perform because it is the most accurate test for diagnosing coronary artery disease. It involves inserting a catheter into the coronary arteries and injecting contrast dye to visualize the coronary arteries and any blockages. This test can provide detailed information about the anatomy of the heart, including the size and shape of the coronary arteries, the degree of any blockages, and the degree of narrowing of the arteries. It can also help to determine the best treatment plan for the patient.",1,"3. A question about the application of knowledge, what is the best test to perform?",E,False,"I chose option 4, Stress echo, because it is the most appropriate test in this situation. The patient has atypical chest pains and a normal 24-hour ECG, but the exercise ECG showed some lateral T-wave inversion, which may indicate ischemia. A stress echocardiogram (stress echo) is a non-invasive test that can help determine if the patient has significant coronary artery disease by assessing the heart's response to stress.

Stress echo combines echocardiography (ultrasound imaging of the heart) with an exercise or pharmacological stress test. It allows the physician to visualize the heart's function at rest and during stress, helping to identify areas of the heart that may not be receiving enough blood due to blocked arteries.

The other options, such as Cardiac CT, Dobutamine stress MRI, Adenosine stress MRI, and Invasive angiogram, may also provide valuable information regarding coronary artery disease, but they may not be the most appropriate next step in this specific case. Stress echo is a more suitable choice due to its non-invasive nature, ability to assess the heart's response to stress, and its effectiveness in detecting coronary artery disease in patients with atypical chest pain and abnormal exercise ECG findings.",D,True,A,False,"[{""page_content"": ""Coronary CT\nWho is the ideal patient to get a coronary CT?

Please note that the question asks which finding is INCORRECTLY matched.
  Huntington disease
There are relatively few radiological manifestations of Huntington disease. The usual one described is atrophy of the heads of the caudate nuclei with consequential prominence of the adjacent lateral ventricle frontal horns with a âboxâ like appearance. Various studies have been done to quantify the extent of this atrophy.

    Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease
There are three types of this prion transmitted disease; the one linked to the BSE (bovine spongiform encephalopathy) epidemic of the late 1980s and 1990s, a rare familial variant, and finally a sporadic version which accounts for the vast majority of the cases. Clinically there is a rapidly progressive dementia with ataxia and myoclonus which should be the give-away feature even before imaging features are discussed. On MRI, the reported finding is of high T2/FLAIR signal in the basal ganglia bilaterally and symmetrically (particularly the putamen). The pulvinar sign is often described in association with cJD which describes high FLAIR signal in the pulvinar thalamic nuclei (called the hockey stick sign). Strangely the signal changes are a rare cause of restriction of diffusion, seen as bright areas on DWI. Important negatives for this condition are the lack of enhancement with contrast and the lack of white matter involvement (since the white matter is protected by its myelin sheath).
  Lewy body dementia
A core clinical feature to this dementia is the fluctuant nature of the symptoms. Parkinsonian features can also develop although these are usually subsequent to the memory decline. Visual hallucinations are also a feature. Radiologically there is a generalised decrease in cerebral volume (sparing the hippocampi). Temporo-parietal hypoperfusion on HMPAO Tc99m SPECT scanning is indicative of Lewy body dementia. Involvement of the occipital cortex, which is typically spared in Alzheimer's disease, sets the two apart from one another on PET studies. The cingulate island sign has also been ascribed to Lewy body dementia, where there is preservation of metabolism in the mid-posterior cingulate gyrus. If present, this is said to be specific for Lewy body dementia.
  Alzheimer's disease
The radiological findings of this well known disease are diffuse sulcal and ventricular enlargement. There is a disproportionate effect to the anterior temporal lobes, hippocampi and sylvian fissures with sparing of the sensorimotor and visual cortices, thalami and cerebellum.
  Parkinson's disease
Generalised cerebral atrophy occurs with Parkinson's disease but is a highly non-specific feature. There are, however, radiological findings in the midbrain which although subtle, are far more specific. Parkinson's disease occurs when there is neuronal loss in the substantia nigra, specifically the pars compacta of the substantia nigra. On a T2 weighted MRI image this appears as blurring of the intermediate signal intensity line which separates the two adjacent low intensity structures (these are the pars reticulata of the substantia nigra and the red nucleus).",False,"The correct answer is 3. Sparing of the hippocampi - Lewy body dementia. This is incorrect because Lewy body dementia is characterized by the presence of Lewy bodies in the hippocampi, not the sparing of the hippocampi.",1,"This question falls under category 1: Basic factual recall, either of basic science, physics, anatomy or regarding a procedure.",D,False,"I chose option 3 because it incorrectly matches the finding of ""sparing of the hippocampi"" to Lewy body dementia.

13943,205045,You are reviewing the imaging of a 41-year-old female patient. On a CT scan there is a geographic area abnormality in segment IV which is hypoattenuating when compared to the rest of the liver. The rest of the liver appears normal in size and shape. On a Primovist enhanced MRI scan there is no distortion of the vascular architecture. What is the most likely diagnosis?,SBA: Gastrointestinal,Focal fatty infiltration,Focal Nodular Hyperplasia,Haemangioma,Hepatocellular carcinoma,Hepatic abscess,A,94%,3%,2%,0%,1%,"Explanation:
Gadoxetic acid disodium (Primovist) and gadobentate disodium (MultiHance) are hepatobiliary specific MRI contrast agents. They are taken up by hepatocytes.
Primovist is labelled with gadolinium in the same way that non-hepatobiliary specific agents such as Dotarem are. Their enhancement characteristics on the arterial and portal venous phases are all but identical, it is only on the delayed hepatobiliary phase (at least 20mins following injection) when the characteristics differ. At this point, the Primovist begins to be excreted by the hepatocytes and there will be enhancement anywhere where there is bile (biliary tree, gallbladder, possibly into the duodenum etc, and any bile leaks). At the same time FNHs remain bright compared to the normal background liver since the hepatocytes within them have taken up the Primovist but excretion is delayed by the abnormality of the associated biliary ductules in the lesion.
Focal steatosis also known as focal fatty infiltration
The liver plays a small role in fat storage, and subtle variation in blood supply and drainage between different areas can lead to variations in the amount of fat in those areas. Focal fatty change is very common and has a geographic appearance on all imaging modalities, with a lack of mass effect (i.e. preservation of the vascular architecture). It can occur anywhere within the liver but is classically found adjacent to the falciform ligament (i.e. segments II, III and IV). Fat-identifying sequences on MRI can be very useful to confirm the diagnosis with signal drop out on out-of-phase images. Focal fatty sparing on the other hand appears as the inverse of this and on CT will be seen as isoattenuation on a background of a diffusely hypoattenuating liver. On ultrasound the liver will be diffusely hyperechoic when compared to the right kidney, and the spared area will be hypoechoic.
  Steatosis can be focal or diffuse. In this example of diffuse steatosis there is signal drop out in the whole of the liver on the out-of phase images:

  Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)
Although metastases are the most common cause of malignant hepatic lesions, hepatocellular carcinoma is the most common primary hepatic malignancy. It usually arises on a background of cirrhosis of any cause. Patients with any of the hepatitis viruses, alcoholic cirrhosis, haemochromatosis, and Wilson disease are all at risk. Carcinogens such as thorotrast and aflatoxin also predispose to HCC formation. Serum alpha fetoprotein levels are often raised, in contrast with cholangiocarcinomas which are one of the main differential diagnoses.
  On imaging HCCs can have a variety of appearances. A large irregular mass with satellite nodules is the most common finding but a diffuse infiltrative version can also occur. Since HCCs derive their blood supply from the hepatic artery they show arterial enhancement on CT with washout on later phases. On ultrasound HCCs tend to be hyperechoic when compared to the rest of the liver and on MRI they show variable signal intensity on both T1 and T2 but arterial enhancement with venous washout can again be seen once Gadolinium has been given. Usually they return slightly higher signal on T2 than the remainder of the liver.
  Fibrolamellar carcinoma of the liver is a specific subtype which occurs in slightly younger patients with otherwise normal livers. It is an echogenic lobulated mass on ultrasound with a central fibrous scar which does not enhance on CT. The lack of enhancement, and sometimes presence of calcification, within the scar separates it from fibrous nodular hyperplasia which is the main differential diagnosis.  On MRI the scar returns low signal on T1 and T2 owing to its fibrous nature.
  Thorotrast is a carcinogenic historic contrast agent used in the 30s and 40s. Its use was abruptly curtailed once it was realised that it is retained indefinitely in the reticuloendothelial system. It causes hepatocellular carcinomas and cholangiocarcinomas but hepatic angiosarcomas are the most frequently quoted related malignancies.
  Haemangioma
Cavernous hepatic haemangiomas are the most common solid benign liver lesions and the second most common liver lesion overall (after secondary tumours). Pathologically they are composed of large vascular channels in which the blood flows very slowly. They are usually supplied by the hepatic artery which goes some way to explaining their enhancement characteristics. With all contrast studies three different types of enhancement can be seen.
Flash haemangiomas â these show immediate and uniform enhancement which persists on delayed sequences (unlike hypervascular tumours which wash out)
Peripheral nodular enhancement on arterial imaging with complete filling in on delayed images
Peripheral nodular enhancement with incomplete filling in â this usually occurs in giant (>5cm diameter) haemangiomas where the central portion is thrombosed.
  On ultrasound they are usually well-defined hyperechoic compared to normal liver parenchyma. Contrast enhanced ultrasound is coming to the forefront of diagnosis for solitary hepatic lesions, relieving some of the burden of MRI. Haemangiomas show either flash filling or peripheral nodular increased reflectivity followed by a gradual total or near total filling in when microbubble contrast is given.
  On MRI the slow flowing blood causes very high signal on T2 weighted images, higher than the spleen and high enough to cause T2 shine through on diffusion weighted images. Conversely although metastases will also show high T2 signal they do not usually outshine the spleen in this regard. Similarly to contrast enhanced ultrasound findings for a haemangioma, the pattern of gradual filling in is replicated with gadolinium-based contrast agents on an MRI scan although on the delayed phase of a hepatobiliary specific contrast agent the lesion will be low in signal as haemangiomas do not contain normal hepatocytes.
  Nuclear medicine studies can be useful in the diagnosis of heamangiomata. Sulphur colloid studies will show a photopenic area initially which 1-2hours later shows increased uptake.
  Focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH)
These lesions typically occur in women in late middle age. They are not caused by oral contraceptive use however they do enlarge in response to hormone stimulation. They are composed of hyperplastic hepatocytes and are thought to arise when a small underlying congenital vascular malformation means that an area of the liver receives a better blood supply and therefore grows better, thus they lack a true capsule but can outgrow their blood supply resulting in the classical central fibrous scar which is present in around half of cases. On imaging they do demonstrate mass effect, displacing adjacent vessels, have marked arterial enhancement which fits in with their supposed aetiology. The central scar enhances only on delayed sequences. On MRI they tend to return high signal on T2 weighted sequences. Their appearance on contrast enhanced ultrasound is interesting; the central scar enhances very early in the arterial phase, branching out in a spoke-wheel type of appearance. During the main arterial phase the lesions enhance strongly before becoming isoechoic in the portal venous phase. On the delayed hepatobiliary phases the lesions are shown to have retained contrast while the adjacent normal liver parenchyma will gradually wash out.  They are the only hepatic lesions to do this.

These benign masses are caused by hormone use (including anabolic steroid use) although they can arise without such exposure. They are composed of hepatocytes without portal tract or bile ducts. Kupffer cells are also absent meaning they do not take up hepotocyte-specific MRI agents such as Primovist. Like FNH they can have a central scar but unlike FNH they have a fibrous pseudocapsule seen on ultrasound as a hypoechoic rim surrounding the otherwise (usually but not always) hyperechoic mass. They have a tendency to outgrow their blood supply which can result in spontaneous haemorrhage (this is often the presenting feature). CT is useful in this regard, as an acute imaging technique however adenomas show arterial enhancement much like FNH making the diagnosis difficult. MRI using Primovist is therefore more useful. On the unenhanced images adenomas are isointense to the rest of the liver on T1, and loses signal on out of phase images much like FNH however adenomas do not enhance with Primovist where FNHs do.
  Hepatic abscess
Liver abscesses can occur in children, for much the same reasons as they arise in adults, although they are far more common in adults. In neonates they may arise as a complication from a misplaced umbilical venous catheter. Pyogenic abscesses result from bacteria accessing the liver via the biliary tree, septicaemia, direct spread, trauma or during a liver procedure. Adult patients are usually in their 60s. Amoebic abscesses occur in slightly younger patients (40s) and tend to result from spread of amoebae from the colon via the portal venous system. On ultrasound abscesses appear as a hypoechoic mass with posterior acoustic enhancement. Internal debris may be apparent. On CT they are usually low in attenuation and may have a rim of enhancing tissue depending on the phase of the contrast. MRI signal characteristics are dependent on the protein content of the pus but usually abscesses return little T1 signal and, owing to their fluid nature, return high signal on T2 weighted sequences. It is said that amoebic abscesses are usually found to be contiguous with the liver capsule.",True,"Focal fatty infiltration is the most likely diagnosis because it is the most common benign liver lesion. It is typically seen as a hypoattenuating area on CT scans, which is consistent with the findings in this case. Additionally, Primovist enhanced MRI scans are typically used to diagnose focal nodular hyperplasia and haemangiomas, but since there is no distortion of the vascular architecture, these two diagnoses are less likely. Hepatocellular carcinoma and hepatic abscess are also less likely because they are usually associated with more extensive and obvious abnormalities in the imaging.",2,,C,True,"I chose option 3, Focal fatty infiltration, because the description of the imaging findings is consistent with this diagnosis. The geographic area of abnormality in segment IV is hypoattenuating compared to the rest of the liver on CT scan, which is a characteristic finding in focal fatty infiltration.

The liver receives its blood supply from two separate sources:
Hepatic portal vein (70-75% of supply)
Hepatic artery (25-30% of supply)
  The hepatic portal vein is the dominant blood supply to the liver. It supplies the liver with poorly oxygenated blood from the spleen and gastrointestinal tract. This blood contains nutrients absorbed from the small intestine and allows the liver to perform important functions such as detoxification.
The hepatic artery carries oxygenated blood from the aorta via the coeliac trunk.
Oxygen is provided from both sources, approximately half of the liverâs oxygen demand being met by each of the sources. The hepatic portal vein and hepatic artery terminate at the porta hepatis by divided into right and left branches to supply the right and left lobes respectively.
Because of this dual supply liver infarction is a relatively rare event. It is also possible for a one-sided infarction to occur.
The hepatic veins are responsible for the venous drainage of the liver. There are usually three hepatic veins draining from the left, middle, and right parts of the liver. These are formed by the union of the central veins of the liver and drain into the inferior vena cava via an opening situated just inferior to the diaphragm.

14159,205045,You are reviewing cases for the next urology MDT. A 65-year-old man has been diagnosed with prostate cancer following TRUS biopsies. His pre-procedure MRI is to be discussed at the meeting. Which of the following features on MRI is most indicative of the presence of prostate cancer? Select ONE answer only.,"SBA: Genito urinary, Adrenal, Obstetrics & Gynaecology and Breast",Low ADC,High signal DWI B0,Low signal on DWI B1200,High T2 signal,High T1 signal,A,85%,9%,3%,3%,1%,"Explanation:
Low signal on the ADC map is the most sensitive sign of peripheral zone prostate cancer.
MRI is currently performed as a staging tool for prostate cancer, not as a screening tool. Unfortunately, following biopsy for confirmation of diagnosis, the presence of haemorrhage within the prostate can compromise the diagnostic quality of the images. It is for this reason that in many centres prostate MRI scans are performed on the basis of elevated PSA levels and suspicious findings on digital rectal examination to exclude the need for a 6-8 week delay between a biopsy and the MRI.
The T1 weighted sequences are most useful for excluding the presence of haemorrhagic foci within the prostate. Haemorrhage will appear bright on a T1 weighted image. T2 weighted sequences are most useful for confirming the presence of prostate cancer itself which will be seen as low signal against the high signal of the normal peripheral zone.
  MRI prostate T1 (best to exclude haemorrhage) T2 (best to see prostate cancer)
Normal peripheral zone Intermediate High
Prostate cancer Isointense to the peripheral zone Low
Haemorrhage High Low

The vast majority of cancers of the prostate are adenocarcinomas and the risk of developing prostate cancer increases with age to such an extent that by the age of 80 approximately 80% of men will have some neoplastic foci within the prostate although these may be completely occult and never manifest clinically. Where the disease does advance it becomes one of the top three most common causes of death from cancer in men alongside lung cancer and colorectal cancer. Serum Prostatic Specific Antigen (PSA) levels have been used in prostate cancer screening since the 1990s.
  Gleason score
This is formed by identifying the most common cell morphology and second most common cell morphology. The different morphologies are compared to a five-point graded system and the two grades added together to give the final score (i.e. 4+2, 5+3 etc.). If there is only one cell morphology the score can be e.g. 3+3. Prostate cancer is defined by a minimum total grading of 6 (usually 3+3).
  MRI is crucial to provide accurate staging but is also gaining in momentum on its way to becoming a screening tool in its own right.
The majority of prostate cancers arise from the peripheral zone and causes the normally high T2 signal to become low signal. Additionally, the cancer should show restriction in diffusion (i.e. high signal on DWI, correspondingly low on ADC). It is important to view the T1 images as well in order to exclude the possibility of haemorrhage which can sometimes look like a prostate cancer on the T2 weighted images.",False,"I chose this answer because DWI B1200 is a type of MRI scan that can be used to identify areas of cancer in the prostate. It works by detecting changes in the movement of water molecules in the prostate tissue. Cancer cells tend to have lower signal on DWI B1200 because they are less able to move water molecules than healthy cells. Therefore, a low signal on DWI B1200 is an indication of the presence of prostate cancer.",1,"3. A question about interpreting/evaluating data?

3. A question about interpreting/evaluating data?",C,True,"I chose option 4, ""Low ADC,"" because it is the most indicative of the presence of prostate cancer on MRI. 

ADC stands for Apparent Diffusion Coefficient, which is a measure derived from diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) sequences in MRI. It quantifies the degree of water molecule diffusion within tissues. In prostate cancer, the tumor cells are typically more densely packed, which restricts the diffusion of water molecules. This restriction results in a lower ADC value compared to normal prostate tissue.

Low ADC values are therefore associated with higher cellularity and are more suggestive of prostate cancer. The other options mentioned, such as high signal DWI B0, low signal on DWI B1200, high T2 signal, and high T1 signal, are not as specific or indicative of prostate cancer as a low ADC value.",A,True,A,True,"[{""page_content"": ""114\nModule 4: Genitourinary, adrenal, obstetrics & gynaecology and breast\n7. \nA 60-year-old man with elevated PSA and a Gleason 4+3 \ntumour undergoes investigation with MRI of the prostate. \nWhich is the single best answer?\n \nA.

The main cavitating neoplastic culprits are:
Bronchogenic carcinoma (Squamous cell carcinoma)
Metastatic squamous cell carcinoma
Adenocarcinoma (Colon + breast)
Contrast enhancement in a nodule is a strong indicator of malignancy and vice versa is also true; the absence of contrast enhancement strongly suggests a nodule is benign. True dependancy (on both supine and prone scans) would be suggestive of aspergilloma formation. Volume loss suggests fibrosis. Atelectasis has many causes and is more often seen in benign disease than as a consequence of neoplasia. Bronchiectasis implies chronicity and is not linked to malignancy (with the exception of post-radiotherapy change).",False,"A dependent nodule is more likely to be malignant because it is located in a large cavity, which is an area that is prone to cancerous growths. The other conditions are not as likely to be malignant.",2,"This question falls under category 2: A question about clinical judgement, what is the correct diagnosis?",B,True,"I chose option 1, ""Enhancement of a mural nodule,"" because the enhancement of a nodule in a CT scan can be an important sign of malignancy. Enhancement refers to the increased visibility of a nodule after the administration of a contrast agent, which helps to differentiate the tissue from its surroundings. Malignant tumors often have increased blood supply, leading to a higher uptake of the contrast agent and a more pronounced enhancement. This can be an indication of the aggressive nature of the tumor and its potential to invade surrounding tissues.

The other options are less indicative of malignancy:
2. Dependant nodule: Nodules that are dependent on the position of the patient are less likely to be malignant and may represent benign processes like mucus plugs or blood clots.
3. Atelectasis: Atelectasis is a collapse of lung tissue, which can be caused by various factors such as obstruction, compression, or scarring. Although it can be associated with lung cancer, it is not directly indicative of malignancy.

Select ONE answer only.",SBA: Paediatrics,"Bilobed lungs, polysplenia, midline liver position","Trilobed lungs, asplenia, midline liver position","Bilobed lungs, polyplenia, normal liver position","Trilobed lungs, asplenia, normal liver position","Trilobed lungs, polysplenia, normal liver position",A,43%,22%,9%,20%,6%,"Explanation:
The patient most likely has polysplenia. It is uncommon for patients with asplenia to reach the age of 3 as almost all of them have TAPVR. ASD is a much more common finding with polysplenia.
  Heterotaxy
There are two main forms of this congenital disorder:
Left sided isomerism (polysplenia)
Things that would usually be found on the left side are duplicated on the right side too. The most consistent features are the abnormalities of the spleen and IVC. The other features are commonly associated, but variably seen. The prognosis is slightly better than for asplenia syndrome as there is a lower association with congenital heart disease. There is still 75% mortality by age 5 though.
Spleen - multiple little spleens
IVC - interrupted IVC with azygos or hemiazygos continuation
Lung lobes - two on either side
Liver - situated centrally in the abdomen
Bowel - malrotation
Pancreas - truncated
Heart - ASD, VSD, PAPVR (less severe congenital heart disease)
  Right sided isomerism (asplenia)
Things that would normally be found on the right side are duplicated on the left side too. Strong association with severe congenital heart disease means the condition has a mortality rate of 80% by age 1. Beyond that, the most consistent feature is the absence of the spleen. Once again, the other features are commonly associated, but variably demonstrated.
Heart - TAPVR and other anomalies (Almost 100% have severe cyanotic congenital heart disease)
Spleen - absent
Lung lobes - three on either side (specific finding)
Liver - normal position (can be midline or malpositioned)
Bowel - malrotation
IVC - on same side as aorta (usually the right)
Kidneys - associated with horseshoe kidney

This question falls under option 3: A question about the application of knowledge, how to interpret a set of clinical findings.",B,True,"I chose option 1 because it best describes the most likely features of heterotaxy in a 3-year-old boy who had a large atrial septal defect (ASD) closed shortly after birth. Heterotaxy is a rare congenital disorder characterized by abnormal arrangement of internal thoracic-abdominal organs across the left-right axis of the body.

Option 1 describes bilobed lungs, polysplenia (multiple spleens), and a midline liver position, which are common features of heterotaxy. In particular, the presence of polysplenia is often associated with left isomerism, which can be seen in heterotaxy syndrome.

The other options do not accurately represent the typical features of heterotaxy:
- Option 2: Trilobed lungs and asplenia are not commonly associated with heterotaxy.
- Option 3: Bilobed lungs and polyplenia are consistent with heterotaxy, but the normal liver position is not.
- Option 4: Trilobed lungs, asplenia, and normal liver position are not typical features of heterotaxy.

14274,205045,You are performing a contrast enhanced ultrasound scan on a patient. There is a 3cm lesion in the left lobe of the liver. Which of the following is INCORRECTLY matched with its likely diagnosis? Select ONE answer only.,SBA: Gastrointestinal,Peripheral nodular enhancement with gradual filling in - flash haemangioma,Immediate uniform enhancement which washes out - malignant lesion,Spoke wheel enhancement of a central scar - fibrous nodular hyperplasia,Gradual uniform enhancement - benign lesion,Arterial enhancement with a non-enhancing central scar - fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma,A,74%,5%,5%,9%,6%,"Explanation:
Please note that the question asks which answer is INCORRECTLY matched.
The correct pairings are as follows:
Immediate uniform enhancement which does not wash out - flash haemangioma
Immediate uniform enhancement which washes out - malignant lesion
Peripheral nodular enhancement with gradual filling in - haemangioma
Spoke wheel enhancement of a central scar - fibrous nodular hyperplasia
Gradual uniform enhancement - benign lesion
Arterial enhancement with a non-enhancing central scar - fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma
  Contrast enhanced ultrasound (CEUS)
CEUS is cheaper than MRI and confers less risk to the patient. The patient is injected with a contrast agent consisting of tiny microbubbles measuring micrometers in diameter. These circulate within the patient and when insonated cause strong reflections which show up as hyperechogenicity in real time as the bubbles wash in and out of the field of view. The microbubbles burst in time and the process can be repeated within a few minutes if required. There is no renal toxicity and adverse reactions are very rare meaning this is a safe procedure for almost all patients. The most significant limitation is the location of the lesion; if the lesion cannot be seen with B-mode ultrasound then it cannot be interrogated with CEUS.
It is a useful technique particularly for differentiating between malignant lesions (which tend to washout rapidly owing to their high vascularity), and benign lesions but is also useful for characterising benign lesions such as haemangiomata or focal nodular hyperplasia by demonstrating the same enhancement patterns which would otherwise be expected on an MRI.
The technique, having been developed with liver lesions in mind, is now being expanded to renal lesions, testicular masses and vascular work too, among others.
As a general rule, if the lesion can be seen on ultrasound, it can be investigated with CEUS however lesions smaller than 10mm are often challenging in this regard. In any case, an anechoic lesion (i.e. a cyst) needs no further investigation. Lesions close to the diaphragm (Segments VII and VIII in particular) are difficult to see with ultrasound at the best of times.",False,The correct match for arterial enhancement with a non-enhancing central scar is hepatocellular adenoma.

The menisci of the knee are two pads of fibrocartilaginous tissue, which have two main functions:
They deepen the articular surface of the tibia and increase stability of the knee joint
To disperse friction between the femur and tibia, acting as âshock absorbersâ
  Both menisci are C shaped and are attached at both ends to the intercondylar area of the tibia.
The medial meniscus is also fixed to the medial collateral ligament and the joint capsule. As a consequence of this injuries to the medial collateral ligament are often accompanied by a tear of the medial meniscus.

14217,205045,A 1-year-old girl is brought to the Emergency Department by her parents. She has severe abdominal tenderness and distension. Ultrasound demonstrates an ileocolic intussusception. She is brought round to the radiology department for an attempt at reduction by fluoroscopically guided air enema. Which of the following steps is best to reduce the dose to the patient? Select ONE answer only.,SBA: Paediatrics,Remove the grid,Large FOV,Continuous fluoroscopy mode,Increase magnification,Reduce collimation,A,80%,2%,1%,6%,11%,"Explanation:
Grids
An anti-scatter grid is useful for patients heavier than around 20kg (about age 4-5) when scatter from within the patient reduces the image quality but, especially for patients smaller than this, the grid only serves to increase the patient dose (by only allowing direct photons through, a greater number of photons must be supplied to create the resultant image). Without any numbers or calculations to perform it is difficult to compare the effects of grid removal and field of view however in this patient the grid should definitely not be used as the patient is too small.
  Magnification and FOV
Image magnification can be achieved either via geometric or electronic means. Geometric magnification reduces patient dose by moving the patient further away from the radiation source however the further the patient is from the source, the greater the blurring effect of any patient (or bowel, or respiratory) motion. Electronic magnification is also called changing the field of view (think of this like zooming) and increasing the FOV does reduce the dose, but at the expense of image sharpness. The dose saving can be significant owing to the inverse square law.
  Collimation
Collimating the x-ray beam involves using lead shielding to concentrate the x-ray beam onto the target area (think of this like cropping). It is important to avoid irradiating tissue which is not required for diagnosis but also reduces operator dose by reducing scatter from the irradiated patient. This may be challenging in a paediatric intussusception scan as it relies on the patient lying still within the target area.
  Continuous vs pulsed
Continuous fluoroscopy mode (as opposed to pulsed fluoroscopy) involves, as the name suggests, imaging continuously as opposed to taking an image at pulsed intervals which involves far less dose. Moving objects are also better imaged with pulsed mode as there can be significant blurring when using continuous fluoroscopy.",False,I chose 3 because increasing the magnification will reduce the dose to the patient by decreasing the amount of radiation that is scattered and increasing the focus of the beam. This will result in a more precise image with less radiation exposure for the patient.,1,3. A question that requires analysis of a clinical scenario.,A,True,"I chose option 1, ""Remove the grid,"" because removing the grid can help reduce the radiation dose to the patient. The grid is used to reduce scatter radiation and improve image quality. However, in pediatric patients, especially in a 1-year-old girl, the amount of scatter radiation is relatively low due to their small size. By removing the grid, less radiation is needed to create an image, thus reducing the overall dose to the patient without significantly compromising image quality. This is important in pediatric patients, as they are more sensitive to radiation and its potential long-term effects.",A,True,A,True,"[{""page_content"": ""obstruction of bowel and the barium enema may show dilatation of \nthe bowel.

10031,205045,A 53-year-old man collides with one of the hurdles during his sonâs sports day. Two months later he is still noticing a lump around the distal femur and undergoes an x-ray. There is a well defined partly calcified soft tissue mass underlying the tender area. There is cortical erosion of the underlying bone. What is the most likely diagnosis?,SBA: Musculoskeletal and Trauma,Malignant fibrous histiocytoma,Myositis ossificans,Tumoral calcinosis,Gout,Osteosarcoma,A,41%,39%,7%,1%,12%,"Explanation:
Malignant fibrous histiocytoma (MFH) - more recently referred to as Undifferentiated Pleomorphic Sarcoma (UPS)
A soft-tissue MFH is the most common subtype of MFHs and the most common malignant primary soft tissue tumour in the over 50s age bracket. It usually presents as a painless soft tissue mass which enlarges over a matter of months. They can be large at the time of diagnosis measuring tens of centimetres. On x-ray they appear as a partly calcified soft tissue mass. Cortical erosion of the underlying bone is an important diagnostic feature. On MRI it returns high signal on both T1 and T2 weighted sequences.
  Myositis ossificans
Trauma to the muscle causes local haemorrhage and necrosis of damaged muscle. The sequelae of this is calcification which can persist long-term. Large muscles are particularly prone to this and the typical patient is a young, active adolescent. Myositis ossificans appears as a calcified soft tissue mass underlying the area of clinical concern. A periosteal reaction may or may not be present but crucially there is no erosion of the underlying cortex, a fact which discriminates it from malignant fibrous histiocytoma. The string sign refers to the presence of a plane of normal tissue separating the mass from the bone and unlike a parosteal osteosarcoma, in myositis ossificans this plane will extend along the whole length of the mass completely separating it from the bone.
  Tumoral calcinosis
Surprisingly for the sometimes extreme appearance of this condition, it can be completely painless. Patients are typically black and in their teens or 20s. Around a third of cases are inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion. A biochemical defect in the metabolism of phosphorus leads to accumulation of hydroxyapatite fluid around the joints causing a foreign-body type granulomatous reaction and fibrous capsule development. On imaging this appears as a progressive and calcified soft tissue mass. The skin overlying the mass can ulcerate and exude a chalky or milk like fluid. Any or all of the hips, shoulders and elbows can be affected but characteristically tumoral calcinosis does not affect the knees. Importantly the underlying bones are normal, a feature which differentiates it from gout or pseudogout.
  Gout
Excess circulating urate levels leads to crystalisation of urate (monosodium urate crystals) within the joint spaces. An acute attack may be precipitated by any acute event such as trauma or surgery as well as a change in diet to include purine containing foods (liver, kidney, game meat, some seafood, alcohol). Historically chronic manifestations of this condition included the development of gouty tophi; white lumpy areas under the skin which could ulcerate and exude a chalky material. These are still seen today but far less so thanks to improved management strategies. Involvement of the first metatarsophalangeal joint is considered classical but involvement of the carpometacarpal joints of the hands is often most debilitating where it occurs. On x-ray the earliest radiological manifestation is a joint effusion. Joint erosions develop on the lateral corners of a joint but contrary to many other erosive processes the base of the ulcers has a sclerotic margin. Juxta-articular osteopenia is not often seen, a feature which acts as a good distinguisher from rheumatoid arthritis, which is thought to be because the attacks come in acute bursts during which time disuse osteopenia does not have the time to develop. Another reasonably specific feature of gouty arthritis is the preservation of the joint space itself until relatively late into the disease.

  These are bone forming tumours which can either be primary, or secondary. Primary osteosarcomas occur in young patients or young adults when the bones are more active during adolescence than in later life, and have a predilection for either the proximal tibia or distal femur i.e. around the knee joint. Secondary osteosarcomas occur as malignant degeneration of pre-existing bone lesions. Clinically they present as a painful mass with a fever. Pain on movement is also typical. In later disease patients may have a raised serum ALP. On x-ray they are poorly defined aggressive lesions with sunburst periosteal reaction and fluffy cloud-like osseous matrix. For staging the patient should receive an MRI of the entire of the affected bone (to rule out synchronous lesions), a nuclear medicine bone scan and a CT chest. Tissue biopsy should only be performed at tertiary referral centres where to mitigate the risk of seeding the biopsy tract, immediate tissue analysis with the option of immediate amputation can be performed.
In the case of a parosteal osteosarcoma, the attachment to the underlying bone may be thin and stalk-like but will be present. Depending on the view a radiolucent plane may seem present for some of the length of the tumour, giving rise to âstring signâ appearance, but an attachment to the parent bone will be present.
  Some of the pertinent subtypes of osteosarcoma
Parosteal
Lower grade, older age (20-50s)
Telangiectatic
Purely lytic, poor prognosis, fluid-fluid levels
Multicentric
Ages 5-10 with very poor prognosis",False,"Myositis ossificans is the most likely diagnosis because it is a condition in which soft tissue, usually muscle, is replaced by bone. It is usually caused by a traumatic injury, such as a collision with a hurdle, and is characterized by a well-defined, partly calcified soft tissue mass underlying the tender area and cortical erosion of the underlying bone, which are both seen in the x-ray.",2,,E,False,"I chose option 2, Myositis ossificans, because the patient's history and the x-ray findings are consistent with this condition. Myositis ossificans is a benign, self-limiting condition in which a soft tissue injury, such as a contusion or muscle strain, leads to the formation of bone within the affected muscle or soft tissue. This can occur after a trauma, like the collision with a hurdle in this case.

The x-ray findings of a well-defined, partly calcified soft tissue mass with underlying cortical erosion are also suggestive of myositis ossificans. Over time, the mass becomes more calcified and may resemble bone.

The other options are less likely given the patient's history and x-ray findings:

1. Malignant fibrous histiocytoma is a rare soft tissue sarcoma that would typically present with a rapidly growing mass, and the history of trauma is not consistent with this diagnosis.

3. Tumoral calcinosis is a rare condition characterized by the deposition of calcium in periarticular soft tissues, usually around large joints such as the hip, shoulder, or elbow. The history of trauma and the location of the mass are not consistent with this diagnosis.

4. Gout is an inflammatory arthritis caused by the deposition of monosodium urate crystals in joints and soft tissues. While it can cause soft tissue masses, the history of trauma and the x-ray findings are not typical for gout.

5. Osteosarcoma is a primary malignant bone tumor.

Please note that the question asks for the answer which is NOT correct.
The anatomy of the middle ear is complex but important and contains a number of specific anatomical terms.
  Image Â© Medical Exam Prep
  The epitympanum, also known as the attic, is the superior portion above the highest point of the tympanic membrane. It contains the head of the malleus and the short crus of the incus (These give the appearance of an ice-cream cone on an axial CT).
  Image Â© Medical Exam Prep
  The Prussak space is found within the epitympanum and is a tiny space at the top of the tympanic membrane, just behind the scutum. Its clinical relevance is that it is the usual origin for pars flaccida cholesteatomas.
The aditus ad antrum connects the epitympanum to the mastoid antrum and thence the mastoid air cells.
The tegmen mastoidium (tegmen means roof) is the point at which the mastoid air cells meet the temporal lobe of the brain.
The tegmen tympani is the point at which the upper most extent of the epitympanum reaches the temporal lobe of the brain.
    Image Â© Medical Exam Prep
  The mesotympanum is the space posterior to the tympanic membrane and contains the body of the incus, the manubrium (connected to the tympanic membrane) and the anterior process of the malleus and the stapes. The stapes is connected to the incus as well as the oval window of the cochlea. There is also a round window placed more inferiorly which bulges to allow compression waves transmitted from the stapes to the oval window to travel through the cochlea.
The hypotympanum is a far less significant space than either the epitympanum or the mesotympanum. It begins at the inferior most extent of the tympanic membrane.

9986,205045,A 45-year-old man with back pain is found to have marked calcification and loss of height in the intervertebral discs of the lumbar spine. There is pronounced chondrocalcinosis and x-rays of his hands show advanced osteoarthritic changes. What is the most likely diagnosis?,SBA: Musculoskeletal and Trauma,Alkaptonuria,Haemochromatosis,Wilson disease,Calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease,Enteropathic arthropathy,A,49%,9%,2%,38%,2%,"Explanation:
Alkaptonuria also known as ochronosis
This condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. It is caused by excessive circulating levels of homogentisic acid (HGA) when the enzyme which would usually degrade it is deficient. HGA has an affinity for collagen and accumulates in the connective tissues throughout the body. In visible light HGA has a blackish colour and thus the disease can be diagnosed in infancy when a babyâs nappies are stained black by the presence of HGA in the urine. By the time patients reach their 20s pigmentation may be visible in their skin, particularly the ears. This is initially a dark yellow colour (hence the term ochronosis, from âOchreâ in Greek meaning a dark yellow colour) but can progress to blue-grey and black.
In imaging chondrocalcinosis is the most prominent feature, with calcification and destruction of the intervertebral discs. Premature osteoarthritic changes to the hands, feet, shoulders, hips and knees will also develop as the collagen deteriorates. Deposition in the heart and kidneys too leads to cardiac and renal failure.
  Haemochromatosis
The primary version of this disease can be inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion. Excess dietary iron is absorbed and this accumulates in all tissues of the body leading to various different problems.
Secondary haemochromatosis can arise if patients receive numerous blood transfusions without sufficient chelation to mitigate against the iron overload.
Cirrhosis â the presence of the excess iron in the liver leads to unusual signal properties on an MRI scan. Iron is paramagnetic and causes spin dephasing. T2* and T2 sequences are particularly vulnerable to this effect but lower than expected signal will be seen on all sequences. Importantly the signal from the spleen and bone marrow should be normal. By contrast they will be involved in cases of transfusional siderosis.
Generalised osteoporosis
Hook like osteophytes on the radial aspect of the metacarpal heads â these are highly characteristic
Chondrocalcinosis, particularly affecting the knees
Insulin dependent diabetes
Congestive cardiomyopathy
Skin pigmentation
  Calcium pyrophosphate dehydrate disease (CPPD) also known as pseudogout
CPPD can present in an acute or subacute fashion but is also seen as a chronic cause of joint inflammation. It may be misdiagnosed as simple osteoarthritis owing to its often bilateral and symmetrical distribution but there are also a couple of areas of the body which can be affected in particular, and which would be unusual for isolated degenerative changes.
The patellofemoral joint â joint space loss here can be extremely striking with almost complete preservation of the joint space at the medial and lateral compartments of the knee
Triangular fibrocartilaginous complex of the wrist â calcification
Radiocarpal joints â degenerative changes without involvement of the DIPs and PIPs
  Wilson disease
Inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion, this disease results from an excess of copper within the body due to the inability of the liver to excrete it. It can present in childhood with cirrhosis but later presentations are more likely to be due to the neuropsychiatric manifestations. Clinically adolescent or adult patients develop tremor and dysarthria due to copper deposition in the lentiform nucleus. The classic diagnostic feature is Kayser-Fleischer pigment rings in the eyes. Radiologically the following features can be seen:
Hepatic manifestations: The liver appears normal on MRI since fatty infiltration effectively cancels out the paramagnetic effects of copper
Musculoskeletal manifestations: Generalised osteoporosis, subarticular cysts, chondrocalcinosis and arthropathy which can mimic CPPD
CNS manifestations: White matter atrophy and T2 hyperintensities predominantly affecting the basal ganglia and thalami. T1 signal is also high in these areas, differentiating it from many of the other basal ganglia disorders. There is a classical feature of âsparing of the red nucleusâ leading to an appearance known as the giant panda sign at the level of the pons.
  Enteropathic arthropathy
Sacroiliitis and spondylitis are the hallmarks of enteropathic arthropathy. It is an important seronegative spondyloarthropathy. Outside of the axial skeleton, other features common to all seronegative spondyloarthropathies are also found. These include arthritis in the hands and feet, uveitis, and enthesitis (especially calcaneal). Interestingly although it is most commonly discussed in relation to Crohnâs disease and Ulcerative Colitis, only 5 and 10% respectively of patients with these conditions will develop enteropathic arthropathy. By contrast of patients with Whipple disease, around 75-90% of them will suffer from enteropathic arthropathy. Infection with Salmonella, Shigella and Yersinia are also known associations.",False,"I chose this answer because calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease is a common cause of back pain in middle-aged adults, and is characterized by calcification and loss of height in the intervertebral discs of the lumbar spine, as well as pronounced chondrocalcinosis and advanced osteoarthritic changes in the hands.",2,,D,False,"I chose option 4, Calcium Pyrophosphate Deposition Disease (CPPD), because the symptoms and findings described in the question align with this condition.

He is hypotensive and tachycardic but sufficiently stable for a CT scan which shows a large retroperitoneal haematoma and a low attenuation lesion within the kidney. He is taken for embolisation and, on entry, the initial angiogram demonstrates microaneurysms within the lesion. What is the most likely diagnosis?","SBA: Genito urinary, Adrenal, Obstetrics & Gynaecology and Breast",AML (angiomyolipoma),RCC,TCC,SCC,Oncocytoma,A,91%,4%,1%,0%,4%,"Explanation:
Angiomyolipoma (AML)
These are benign tumours which occur within the kidney and characteristically contain fat on CT scan. On an MRI scan they return high signal on both T1 and T2 and classically show signal drop-out on gradient echo sequences. They are usually small and harmless but occasionally can bleed into the retroperitoneum causing haemorrhagic shock (Wunderlich syndrome). This is more likely to occur the larger the AML due to the presence of microaneurysms. Those > 4 cm can be considered for resection or embolisation. Tuberous sclerosis is strongly associated with multiple angiomyolipomata which can be both large and numerous. Other phakomatoses such as Neurofibromatosis type 1 (not type 2) and von Hippel Lindau are also associated with AMLs to a lesser degree, as is polycystic kidney disease.
  Transitional cell carcinoma (TCC)
Bladder TCCs are very common but renal TCCs less so. Nonetheless they have a knack for appearing in multiple locations at once and thus careful evaluation of the upper tracts is necessary each time a new diagnosis of bladder TCC is made. They appear as filling defects on the excretory phase of a CT scan or IVU.
  Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC)
This is an âalso-ranâ malignancy of the urinary tract accounting for 1% of kidney tumours. Clinically it will present in a similar fashion with haematuria however on CT there is no mass lesions to be seen as the SCC infiltrates the renal parenchyma causing renal enlargement with preservation of the overall kidney shape.
  Oncocytoma
Oncocytomas have a characteristic feature of a stellate spoke wheel vascular pattern with an enhancing central scar. In reality there is so much overlap between the features of these tumours, which are largely benign, and renal cell carcinomas, that oncocytomas must be resected for histological confirmation of the diagnosis. They can present at any age but are usually asymptomatic, despite often being very large. In the real world they can engulf the perinephric fat and confusingly come to resemble an AML which is unhelpful.
  Renal cell carcinoma (RCC)
This is the most common kidney tumour, accounting for around 80%. Patients are usually in their 50-70s although there is an increased incidence in dialysis patients and those with von Hippel Lindau. Clinically there is a classically macroscopic haematuria. A quarter or patients develop a paraneoplastic syndrome such as:
Hypercalcaemia
Polycythaemia due to erythropoietin
Stauffer syndrome (hepatomegaly without hepatic metastasis)
Limbic encephalitis
A renal protocol CT is used to evaluate lesions found on ultrasound and includes an unenhanced phase, a 60 second (corticomedullary) phase, and a 100 second (nephrogenic) phase. An excretory phase at 15 minutes can also be performed if evaluation of the collecting system anatomy is required (e.g. if the patient is a candidate for a partial nephrectomy). There are a number of different histological subtypes which are simplified and summarised in the table below:
  Histology
Prevalence
Associations
Clear cell renal carcinoma
75%
Von Hippel Lindau syndrome
Papillary renal cell carcinoma
15%
Most strongly associated with dialysis patients. Better prognosis than clear cell (if diagnosed prior to metastasis).
Chromophobe renal cell carcinoma
5%
These are histologically like oncocytomas. Associated with Birt-Hogg-Dube (rare autosomal dominant disease affecting skin follicles, also causes lung cysts). They are thought to have a better prognosis than clear cell renal carcinoma.
Medullary carcinoma
<1%

12356,205045,A 32-year-old woman who delivered a healthy baby two days previously in an uncomplicated normal vaginal delivery has an MRI pituitary which shows an area of high T1 signal in the suprasellar and sellar region. What is the most likely diagnosis?,SBA: Central Nervous and Head & Neck,Bleed without adenoma,Pineoblastoma,Craniopharyngioma,Bleeding into macroadenoma,Atrophic pituitary,D,37%,1%,4%,55%,3%,"Explanation:
This patient has haemorrhaged into the pituitary gland (as evidenced by the high T1 signal). Sheehan syndrome is consequent on obstetric hypovolaemia which is excluded by the description of an uncomplicated normal vaginal delivery. It is therefore more likely that she has undergone spontaneous pituitary apoplexy (and that the pregnancy is a red herring) ie bleeding into a macroadenoma.
  Pituitary apoplexy
Pathologically, pituitary apoplexy is infarction which can take place with or without haemorrhage. Over half of patients have an underlying macroadenoma; haemorrhage into a pre-existing macroadenoma is the usual presentation. 'All' patients present with a headache and panhypopituitarism. Visual impairment is also common as the pituitary enlarges and impacts on the chiasm. On a CT scan there will be a sellar/suprasellar mass (ie pituitary enlargement). Hyperdensity is caused by the underlying haemorrhage, if present. On an MRI, the pituitary can be seen to be enlarged with T1 hyperintensity (specifically in the subacute phases). In the chronic phase however, the pituitary will be involuted and small, even appearing as an 'empty sella'.
  Sheehan syndrome is pituitary apoplexy due to hypovolaemic shock and can be consequential to delivery. At the time of apoplexy, the predominant issue for the patient is the systemic hypovolaemia for which aggressive management is usually already being pursued. In the early days following the delivery, the first hypopituitary issues to manifest is usually any or all of hyponatraemia, diabetes insipidus or hypothyroidism. At this time the MRI findings can vary from a normal appearing pituitary through to the classic pituitary apoplexy appearances of an enlarged pituitary with high T1 signal. Patients can also present many months or years later with panhypoituitarism at which time an MRI will usually show an empty sella.
 ",False,"Craniopharyngioma is the most likely diagnosis because it is the most common type of pituitary tumor found in this region. It is typically slow-growing and benign, and can cause symptoms such as headaches, vision problems, and hormone imbalances. An MRI can reveal a high T1 signal in the suprasellar and sellar region, which is consistent with a craniopharyngioma.",2,,C,False,"I chose option 1, ""Bleed without adenoma,"" as the most likely diagnosis because the patient is a 32-year-old woman who recently delivered a healthy baby through an uncomplicated normal vaginal delivery. During childbirth, there is an increased risk of bleeding due to the significant changes in blood volume and hormonal fluctuations. In some cases, this can lead to a condition called postpartum pituitary hemorrhage or Sheehan's syndrome, where there is bleeding in the pituitary gland without the presence of an adenoma (a benign tumor).

The MRI findings of high T1 signal in the suprasellar and sellar region are consistent with hemorrhage, making option 1 the most plausible diagnosis given the patient's recent childbirth. The other options (pineoblastoma, craniopharyngioma, and bleeding into macroadenoma) are less likely given the patient's clinical history and the MRI findings.

Three days later she comes back to hospital and is seen in the A+E department complaining of ongoing abdominal pain and abdominal fullness. She undergoes a CT scan which shows a large volume of intraperitoneal fluid measuring 10HU. What should the radiologist suggest next?,SBA: Gastrointestinal,MRI with gadoxetic acid disodium (Primovist),Contrast enhanced ultrasound,Expectant management,Arterial phase CT,MRI with gadodiamide (Omniscan),A,72%,1%,14%,6%,7%,"Explanation:
It is sometimes difficult on CT to prove that intra-abdominal fluid is bile. Distinguishing it from post-op fluid collections in particular may be challenging. Usually bile measures around 0-10HU and often its copious nature points to the diagnosis since the liver produces a surprisingly large volume of bile each day.
Gadoxetic acid disodium (Primovist) and gadobentate disodium (MultiHance) are hepatobiliary specific MRI contrast agents. Since it is excreted by hepatocytes it is removed from the body in bile and thus can be exceedingly useful in diagnosing a bile leak. A hepatobiliary phase scan at around 20 minutes for Primovist or 100 minutes for MultiHance can provide the diagnosis in many such cases.
CT cholangiography is possible using meglumine iotroxate (Biliscopin) which is excreted by the liver but has the obvious disadvantage of added radiation dose. The contrast agent is also less widely available than Primovist or MultiHance are.
Vicarious excretion of water-soluble contrast material does occur via the hepatic route. It can sometimes be seen in cases of renal failure or obstruction and may also occur on CT scans taken 1-2 days after a previous CT scan in otherwise healthy patients.",False,"Contrast enhanced ultrasound is the best option for further evaluation of the intraperitoneal fluid in this case. Contrast-enhanced ultrasound can provide detailed information about the size, shape, and location of the fluid, as well as its composition.

Myelolipoma is a benign tumour with large areas of fat within it. Only about Â¼ have calcification. On MRI, myeloid is seen as focal areas of low T1 signal. The lesions are present with retroperitoneal haemorrhage. They are associated with endocrine disorders, such as Cushingâs and Connâs disease, but do not cause them.
With any lesion on an MRI scan the key to diagnosis lies in determining the tissue content. Try to decide if a lesion contains fat, fluid, blood or all three by going through the tissue types one by one.
Each different sequence helps to eliminate/rule-in the different tissue types.
Blood - high on T1 and does not suppress on T1 fat saturated sequences (e.g. the precontrast sequence)
Fluid - high on T2. Compare with known fluid filled organs such as the bladder for pelvic scans and the gallbladder for upper abdominal scans. If the target lesion is fluid, it should not just be slightly high on T2 but should be as high as these reference organs.
Fat - high on T1 and does suppress on fat saturated sequences (macroscopic fat), or demonstrates chemical shift artefact on out of phase images (microscopic fat).

Nocardia
This is a rare infection which occurs particularly in bone marrow transplant patients as well as those with AIDs. Lobar consolidation and nodules with cavitation are seen but lymph node enlargement is notably absent.
  CMV infection
An opportunistic infection, CMV is seen in immunocompromised patients, most commonly those with AIDs. Small nodules with patchy ground glass opacification is seen on CT. It is also included in the differential diagnosis for the tree-in-bud appearance but as such it is unusual because the luminal opacification is derived from bronchial wall thickening as opposed to an exogenous substance. Changes are usually widespread; there is no particular predilection for the middle lobe.
  Aspergillosis
Aspergillosis is an all encompassing term which refers to the spectrum of lung diseases caused by the fungus Aspergillus. How the fungus affects the patient depends on their underlying immune status.
Severely immunocompromised patients                        â Invasive aspergillosis
Mildly immunocompromised patients                            â semi-invasive aspergillosis
Normal patients                                                                   â non-invasive aspergillosis (such as colonization of a pre-existing cyst or cavity)
Hypersensitive patients (Cystic fibrosis or asthmatics) â Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA)
  The halo sign is used to describe the appearance of a nodule surrounded by a âhaloâ of ground glass opacification. It occurs when there is alveolar haemorrhage and is considered to be a classical finding in invasive aspergillosis.
  Graft vs Host disease
When T-cells from the donor bone marrow attack epithelial cells in the recipient a phenomenon known as Graft versus Host disease can occur. The effects are classically seen in the GI tract and the skin as opposed to the lungs but pulmonary manifestations can arise a few months after the transplant. On CT there is mild perihilar fibrosis with nodule formation.

This infection can cause shortness of breath, fever, and patchy lower lobe consolidation. It is important to rule out other possible causes, such as Nocardia, CMV, Graft vs Host Disease, and Bleomycin toxicity, but Invasive aspergillosis is the most likely cause in this case.",2,,C,False,"I chose option 2, Invasive aspergillosis, because the patient's symptoms and clinical context align with this diagnosis. A 25-year-old who has recently undergone a bone marrow transplant is immunocompromised, which increases their risk of developing fungal infections like invasive aspergillosis. The presentation of shortness of breath, fever, and patchy lower lobe consolidation in the lungs also suggests a pulmonary infection, which is consistent with invasive aspergillosis. 

The other options are less likely in this scenario:
1. CMV (Cytomegalovirus) can cause similar symptoms, but it is more likely to present with systemic symptoms and diffuse lung involvement rather than patchy consolidation.
3. Graft vs Host disease typically presents with skin, gastrointestinal, and liver manifestations, rather than pulmonary symptoms.
4. Bleomycin toxicity is a chemotherapy-related complication, but it usually presents with diffuse lung involvement and is not specific to individuals who have undergone a bone marrow transplant.

14586,205045,You are reviewing a cardiac MRI scan which shows a mass in the left ventricle. You are considering a number of differential diagnoses. Which of the following is correctly matched to its description? Select ONE answer only.,SBA: Cardiothoracic and vascular,Cardiac sarcoma - involves left ventricle and left atrium,Atrial thrombus - avid enhancement,Atrial myxoma - mass attached to valve by a stalk,Cardiac metastasis - narrow base attachment to the myocardium,Papillary fibroelastoma - high in signal on T2,A,67%,2%,18%,6%,7%,"Explanation:
Involvement of more than one chamber of the heart is a useful sign of a malignant lesion.
  Cardiac sarcoma
There are many different types of cardiac sarcoma. Cardiac sarcomas are the most common cause of primary malignant cardiac tumours. Their presentation usually relates either to embolic phenomena such as TIAs or symptoms from invasion such as pericardial effusion. In contrast to myxomas or fibroelastomas, malignant lesions tend to have a broad attachment to the heart wall. Involvement of more than one chamber of the heart, regardless of which side is involved, is a strong indicator of malignancy. With regards which side of the heart is affected; the most common kind of cardiac sarcoma is an angiosarcoma and these have a predilection for the right side of the heart however they are also found on the left side, and angiosarcomas account for less than 50% of all sarcomas, the remainder of which are more commonly (though not exclusively) found on the left.
  Cardiac metastases
Metastases are significantly more common than cardiac sarcomas meaning metastases are the most common malignant cardiac tumours. In contrast to myxomas or fibroelastomas, malignant lesions tend to have a broad attachment to the heart wall. Tumours can be from lung or breast cancer, lymphoma, leukaemia and malignant melanoma.
  Papillary fibroelastoma
These tumours are rare even for cardiac tumours but yet are the most common cardiac tumour to be associated with the valves. Rather counter-intuitively, they do not cause valvular dysfunction. They are usually quite small and, like myxomas, relatively mobile, attached by a stalk, and able to prolapse through a valve but where myxomas usually arise from the interatrial septum, papillary fibroelastomas grow from the valve itself. Histopathologically they are gelatinous tumours resembling sea anemones with multiple papillary projections. They can act as a focus for platelet aggregation leading to systemic emboli for left sided masses or pulmonary emboli for right sided masses. On MRI they are often low in signal on T2 weighted sequences owing to their fibrous nature.
  Atrial thrombus
The usual site for an atrial thrombus would be the left atrial appendage. Thrombi are not seen as mobile masses but as irregular lobulated masses. They can have a laminated appearance and the classical feature is low signal on gradient-echo MRI sequences owing to the presence of haemosiderin (blooming artefact). They do not enhance. Ventricular thrombi can form too, it is usually a sequela of a previous myocardial infarction which has healed leaving a hypomobile portion of the ventricular wall. Adjacent to that part of wall there is relative stasis sufficient to facilitate thrombus formation.
  Atrial myxoma
These are the most common benign neoplasms of the heart. Although usually sporadic, they can occur as part of Carney complex (atrial myxoma, facial/buccal pigmentation, sertoli tumours of the testis and multiple other findings. Not to be confused with Carney triad - pulmonary hamartomas, gastric leiomyosarcomas and extra-adrenal paragangliomas). The finding of a small mass attached to the interatrial septum by a stalk is classical. Their mobility allows some to prolapse through the relevant atrioventricular valve during the cardiac cycle. They can act as a focus for platelet aggregation leading to systemic emboli for the more common left sided masses or pulmonary emboli for right sided myxomas. Iso or hypointensity on T1w MRI is typical.

Basic factual recall,C,False,I chose option 4 (Papillary fibroelastoma - high in signal on T2) because it is the most accurate description among the given options.

9876,205045,A 34-year-old man suffers a knee injury while on a heavily activity based holiday. He undergoes x-rays at a local hospital which show no fractures. On returning home he is referred to an orthopaedic surgeon by his GP when his pain fails to resolve. An MRI is arranged which shows high signal on T2 and STIR sequences affecting the anterior aspect of the tibia. There is also a posterior cruciate ligament tear. What is the most likely diagnosis?,SBA: Musculoskeletal and Trauma,Dashboard injury,Transient patella dislocation,Pivot shift injury,Hyperextension injury,Clip injury,A,70%,1%,4%,23%,2%,"Explanation:
Bony contusions
Bruising to the bone can be detected around 2 days following an injury but may not resolve for many months thereafter. With regards knee injuries, it is often possible to discern the mechanism of injury from the pattern of bruising seen. The contusions follow fluid on MRI scans i.e. low in signal on T1 and high on T2 (and STIR). STIR is used to suppress the fat of the bone marrow thereby making the fluid stand out more.
  Dashboard injury
As the name would suggest, this injury is usually (although not exclusively) sustained by impact of the knee against the dashboard of a car during a road traffic incident. Force applied to the anterior aspect of the tibia when the knee is flexed leads to:
Osteochondral injury or fracture to the anterior aspect of the tibia
Posterior cruciate ligament rupture/sprain
  Clip injury and pivot shift injury
These two injuries are very similar. Both involve valgus stress on a flexed knee (such as a tackle to the knee during sports). A pivot shift injury also requires external rotation of the tibia. The three main structures most at risk during these injuries are:
Anterior cruciate ligament (especially in a pivot shift injury)
Medial collateral ligament (especially in a clip injury)
Medial meniscus (remember that the medial meniscus is attached to the medial collateral ligament)
If all three are present together it is referred to as the OâDonoghue triad. Since OâDonoghue defined this triad however, it has been discovered that lateral meniscal tears are actually more common with this type of injury than medial meniscus ones.
Bony contusions occur at the side of impact because the proximal tibia and distal femur impact on one another thus:
Lateral tibial plateau (posterolateral in pivot shift injury)
Lateral femoral condyle
  Transient lateral patella dislocation injury
When the patella dislocates laterally, its medial facet can impact onto the anterolateral corner of the lateral femoral condyle. Both areas become damaged and contusions can be seen on MRI. Often though, the patella reduces spontaneously and thus the exact mechanism of injury must be inferred from the imaging findings.
Joint effusion
Osteochondral injuries to the anterolateral femoral condyle and medial patella facet
Sprain or disruption to the medial retinaculum
  Hyperextension injury
These occur often following excessively forceful kicking. There will be bony contusions at the anterior aspect of the tibial plateau and femoral condyles. Either of the anterior or posterior cruciate ligaments may also be involved.
Contusions to the anterolateral aspect of the lateral femoral condyle and inferomedial patella",True,"Dashboard injuries are caused by direct trauma to the knee joint, such as a dashboard impact, and are the most likely diagnosis in this case. The MRI findings of high signal on T2 and STIR sequences affecting the anterior aspect of the tibia, as well as the posterior cruciate ligament tear, are consistent with a dashboard injury.",2,,D,True,"I chose ""4. Dashboard injury"" because the MRI findings mentioned in the scenario are consistent with this type of injury. A dashboard injury typically occurs when the knee is forcibly driven into the dashboard during a car accident, causing the tibia to be pushed posteriorly on the femur. This can result in a tear of the posterior cruciate ligament (PCL), as mentioned in the MRI findings. The high signal on T2 and STIR sequences affecting the anterior aspect of the tibia also suggests bone contusion or edema, which is commonly associated with this type of injury.

14034,205045,A 6-week-old infant undergoes abdominal ultrasound for investigation of prolonged jaundice. Which finding is most indicative of extra-hepatic biliary atresia? Select ONE answer only.,SBA: Gastrointestinal,An echogenic band running anterior to the portal vein at the porta,A small gallbladder,Non-visualisation of the common bile duct,A fusiform cystic lesion lying adjacent to the gallbladder,Dilated intrahepatic ducts,A,68%,3%,11%,4%,15%,"Explanation:
The most specific sign of biliary atresia is the triangular cord sign. This is an echogenic band running anterior to the portal vein at the porta. A small gallbladder, dilated intrahepatic ducts and non-visualisation of the gallbladder are all features consistent with biliary atresia, but the triangular cord sign would be most indicative of the condition. It is associated with polysplenia and heterotaxy syndrome.
  Biliary atresia
This presents between two weeks and two months of life as an obstructive jaundice picture (i.e. conjugated hyperbilirubinaemia). The extrahepatic bile ducts have become fibrosed and cause obstruction. Initial investigation is usually with ultrasound and an echogenic âtriangular cordâ structure in the porta hepatitis is considered pathognomic. The gallbladder may be normal, small or non-visualised and therefore contributes little to the diagnosis. Further investigation is often with a HIDA scan. If there is normal activity within the liver (usually after only a few minutes) but there is no visualisation of tracer within the bowel after 24 hours this is considered diagnostic. Phenobarbitol can be given in the days leading up to the scan to increase biliary output.",False,"Non-visualisation of the common bile duct is a classic sign of extra-hepatic biliary atresia. In this condition, the bile ducts are blocked, preventing bile from draining from the liver into the intestine. This can lead to jaundice and other complications. The other options are not specific signs of biliary atresia.",2,"This question falls under category 2: A question about clinical judgement, what is the correct diagnosis?",B,False,"I chose option 2, ""Non-visualisation of the common bile duct,"" because extra-hepatic biliary atresia is a condition in which the bile ducts outside the liver are either absent or blocked.

Your colleague points out the sagittal sinus thrombosis which has caused her problems. What is the best description of this diagnosis? Select ONE answer only.,SBA: Central Nervous and Head & Neck,Dense triangle sign,Empty delta sign,Bilateral haemorrhages,Subarachnoid haemorrhage,Bilateral infarctions,A,80%,13%,3%,0%,2%,"Explanation:
The empty delta sign is a post-contrast CT finding. Bilateral haemorrhages can be a secondary consequence to a sagittal sinus thrombosis which may point towards the diagnosis but the thrombosis itself is recognised by the empty delta sign on post-contrast CT.
Dense triangle sign pertains to the acute thrombus as it appears on an unenhanced CT scan.
On an MRI, static blood within the sagittal sinus gives rise to low signal on T1, although the thrombus itself is likely to be high in signal (if subacute in nature). Normally the sagittal sinus will appear as a flow void on T1w. Blooming artefact can be seen on T2* gradient echo sequences and is a strong indicatory of the diagnosis. Confusion can arise with time-of-flight 3D reformatted images and great care should be taken not to overdiagnose flow artefactas thrombosis. Careful reference should always be made to the source images and where there is doubt a CT venogram may be of more use.
The associated infarctions can often be haemorrhagic and parasagittal haemorrhages are very specific for a sagittal sinus thrombosis but subarachnoid haemorrhage is not likely to be related.",True,"The dense triangle sign is a CT scan finding that is indicative of sagittal sinus thrombosis. It is seen as a triangular area of increased density in the sagittal sinus on an unenhanced CT scan. This is due to the presence of a clot in the sagittal sinus, which causes a decrease in the flow of blood, leading to an increase in the density of the area.",3,"3. A question about the application of knowledge, what is the best description of this diagnosis?",B,False,"I chose option 1, the ""Empty delta sign,"" because it is the best description of the diagnosis for a sagittal sinus thrombosis on a CT scan. The empty delta sign is a classic radiological sign seen in patients with cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, specifically in the superior sagittal sinus. It appears as a triangular or delta-shaped filling defect within the contrast-enhanced sinus, indicating the presence of a blood clot.

9691,205045,"A 12-year-old boy, who is otherwise well, is taken to his GP by his mother who is concerned that he has developed a limp for the last 2 days. What is the most likely diagnosis?",SBA: Paediatrics,Legg-Calve-Perthes disease,Transient synovitis of the hip,Septic arthritis,Juvenile idiopathic arthritis,Osteoid osteoma,A,32%,59%,4%,4%,1%,"Explanation:
There is very little information to go on in this question, and no actual imaging findings. All of the answers provided could conceivably cause a limp in a 13-year-old boy. Without any additional information however, Perthes disease is the most likely answer. Technically symptoms must have been present for at least 6 weeks for a diagnosis of JIA. The patient is otherwise well and slightly too old for a diagnosis of transient synovitis. Septic arthritis must always be considered and should be investigated for with an ultrasound but there is nothing further in the information provided to suggest this as a diagnosis over Perthes disease. An osteoid osteoma usually presents with night pain.
  Legg-Calve-Perthes disease
Avascular necrosis of the femoral head can occur spontaneously, particularly in young (around 2-12 years, although usually 4-8 years) Caucasian boys. It is named Legg-Calve-Perthes disease and often referred to only as Perthes disease. Avascular necrosis of the femoral head secondary to sickle cell disease, leukaemia or steroid use is not technically Perthes disease.

  Perthes disease is best appreciated on a frog-leg lateral view and this view must always be included in a series when investigating for the disease and the disease should always be considered in patients presenting with a painful limp. Of the early changes, ipsilateral demineralisation is the least consistent with Perthes disease. The presence of a radiolucent crescent shaped subchondral fracture has an even lower incidence but is also not seen until late on in the disease. The goal of imaging is to identify patients early before they reach this stage.
On MRI there will be a âdouble-lineâ sign on T2 with sclerotic/necrotic bone returning little signal but the granulation tissue returning high signal. The bone marrow becomes low on T1 and high on T2.
  Transient synovitis of the hip
This is the most common cause of an acute limp in a child and is usually preceded by a viral infection such as an upper respiratory tract infection. Patients may have a low-grade fever and around half have an elevated serum ESR but characteristically the x-rays will be normal with the possible exception of a joint effusion. The usual age-range is 5-10-year-olds.
  Septic arthritis
Septic arthritis in any age group is a surgical emergency and the joint must be washed out as soon as feasible in order to avoid irreversible joint damage caused. Clinical suspicious must therefore be high, not least because early x-rays may be normal. Initial investigation should be with ultrasound and echogenic debris may be found within a joint effusion. The diagnosis is confirmed by aspiration of purulent joint fluid. The condition can also be readily appreciable on MRI which is very sensitive for early joint damage. Synovial oedema can be seen as high signal on T2 with enhancement post-gadolinium on T1 fat saturated sequences.

  Juvenile idiopathic arthritis, (JIA) previously juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (JRA)
This is very similar to rheumatoid arthritis but occurs in patients below the age of 16. Patients present with joint stiffness and pains on waking. Fever and lymph node enlargement are also common. Technically, symptoms must have been present for at least six weeks for the diagnosis to be made. Unlike rheumatoid arthritis it is the large joints which are affected early on with subsequent involvement of the little joints of the hands and feet. On x-ray there will be periarticular osteoporosis but the increased perfusion of the epiphyses as a result of inflammation leads to overgrowth, early fusion and overall bone shortening. Erosions and destruction of the joint can be severe, even resembling a neuropathic joint.
  Osteoid osteoma
These are small benign tumours but which can be quite symptomatic, classically with pain relieved by aspirin. The majority form in the diaphyses of long bones but the posterior elements of the spine is another classic location.
The radiolucent nidus and symptoms of night pain in a young patient point to either an osteoid osteoma or an osteoblastoma. The final diagnosis comes down to size: <1.5 cm is definitely an osteoid osteoma, and >2 cm is definitely an osteoblastoma. There is a nasty grey area somewhere between the two sizes.
On x-ray the radiolucent nidus may not be fully appreciated and the abnormality which is picked up will be the consequential sclerotic solid periosteal reaction. In the spine there may be a painful scoliosis concave towards the lesion as a result of adjacent muscular spasm. CT is used to confirm the diagnosis as the nidus is readily appreciable.",False,I chose this answer because transient synovitis of the hip is the most likely diagnosis for a 12-year-old boy who has developed a limp for the last two days. It is the most common cause of hip pain and limp in children and is usually self-limiting and resolves within a few days with rest and anti-inflammatory medications. It is often preceded by a viral infection and is usually not associated with any joint damage.,2,,B,False,"I chose option 1, Transient synovitis of the hip, because it is the most common cause of hip pain and limping in children, especially in the age group of the patient mentioned in the question. Transient synovitis is a self-limiting inflammation of the synovium (the lining of the joint) and usually occurs after a viral infection.

Select ONE answer only.,SBA: Paediatrics,Left sided vesicoureteric reflux,Drooping lily sign,Cobra head sign,Claw sign,Longitudinal filling defect in the posterior urethra,A,49%,3%,12%,1%,35%,"Explanation:
Reflux can be bilateral or unilateral. When unilateral it usually on the left side. The filling defect seen in the posterior urethra is curvilinear and orientated in a transverse manner.
The drooping lily sign is seen with suprarenal tumours such as a neuroblastoma.
The cobra head sign is seen with ureterocoeles.
The claw sign is seen in intrarenal masses such as Wilms tumours.
  Posterior urethral valves
Posterior urethral valves is a condition restricted to baby boys and is sometimes diagnosed antenatally. The posterior urethra consists of the prostatic and membranous portions. The formation of valves here leads to outflow obstruction and dilatation of the posterior urethra. Obstruction causes the trabeculation of the bladder and reflux through the vesico-ureteric junction (which occurs more on the left than the right) causes hydronephrosis. The first line of investigation should be a micturating cystogram which will show fusiform dilatation of the posterior urethra and trabeculation of the bladder as well as any reflux. Prognosis is variable but some patients require renal replacement due to irreversible damage to the kidneys.",False,"The cobra head sign is a specific finding on an MCUG that is indicative of posterior urethral valves. It is characterized by a rounded, cobra-like appearance of the posterior urethra, which is caused by an obstruction at the bladder neck. This is a key diagnostic sign for posterior urethral valves.",2,"This question falls under category 2: A question about clinical judgement, what is the correct diagnosis?",C,False,"I chose the ""Drooping lily sign"" because it is a classic radiological finding on a micturating cystourethrogram (MCUG) that is consistent with the diagnosis of posterior urethral valves (PUV). PUV is a congenital condition in male infants, characterized by obstructing membranes in the posterior urethra, leading to urinary outflow obstruction and hydronephrosis.

14438,205045,Which part of the pancreas is intraperitoneal? Select ONE answer only.,SBA: Gastrointestinal,The tail,The head,The neck,The body,The uncinate process,A,71%,14%,2%,5%,8%,"Explanation:
The pancreas is a glandular organ that has mixed endocrine and exocrine function:
Endocrine function: controls blood glucose levels via the secretion of insulin and glucagon
Exocrine function: secretes digestive enzymes into the duodenum
  The pancreas is approximately 12-15 cm long and lies transversely and obliquely on the posterior abdominal wall behind the stomach. Here it crosses the L1-L2 lumbar vertebrae. The pancreas is a retroperitoneal structure, apart from the tail, which is the only intraperitoneal part.
The exocrine component of the pancreas is composed of a series of clustered cells called acini. The secretory cells of each acinus surround a small intercalated duct, which drain into a network of intralobar collecting ducts. These in turn drain into the pancreatic duct.
The pancreatic duct begins at the tail of the pancreas runs the entire length to the head. Here it unites with the common bile duct to form the ampulla of Vater, which in turn opens into the duodenum. The ampulla of Vater opens into the duodenum and the release of bile at this point is controlled by a muscular valve called the sphincter of Oddi.
The pancreas can be divided into five parts:
1. The head:
This is the widest part and lies within the âC-shapedâ curve created by the duodenum. It rests posteriorly on the inferior vena cava, the right renal artery and vein and the left renal vein. The bile duct lies in a groove on its posterior surface.
  2. The uncinate process:
This is a prolongation of the head that extends superiorly and to the left to lie beneath the body. It lies posterior to the superior mesenteric vessels.
  3. The neck:
This is located between the head and the body. It lies in the transpyloric plane approximately 1-2 cm to the right of the midline. It is grooved posteriorly by the superior mesenteric vessels and the hepatic portal vein is formed by the union of the superior mesenteric vein and the splenic vein posterior to it.
  4. The body: this is the central part of the pancreas. It extends from the neck along a line running upwards and to the left for about 10 cm until it reaches the hilum of the spleen. It crosses anterior to the aorta, the L2 vertebra, the left adrenal gland, and the left kidney during its course.
  5. The tail: this is the end of the pancreas. It lies in close proximity to the hilum of the spleen and passes between the layers of the splenorenal ligament. This is the only part of the pancreas that is intraperitoneal.
  The pancreas and its relations (from Grayâs Anatomy)
 ",False,"The body of the pancreas is intraperitoneal, meaning it is located within the peritoneal cavity.

Involvement of either the upper or lower zones is typical for a number of different pathologies. Many of the upper lobe pathologies related to inhalational processes and conversely many of the lower lobe pathologies can be explained by their basis in the increased blood flow. There are a number of different mnemonics for either area, some better than others.
For example, a mnemonic for involvement of the upper zones is BREASTS:
B = Beryllosis
R = Radiation
E = Eosinophilic granuloma (Langerhans cell histiocytosis) and Extrinsic Allergic Alveolitis
A = Ankylosing spondylitis
S = Sarcoidosis
T = Tuberculosis
S = Silicosis
  Involvement of the lower zones can be remembered with the mnemonic BADAS:
B = Bronchiectasis
A = Aspiration pneumonia
D = Drugs and Desquamative interstitial pneumonia
A = Asbestosis
S = Scleroderma (and Rheumatoid arthritis)",True,"Lower zones are most commonly affected in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and respiratory symptoms. This is because the lower zones of the lungs are most affected by chronic inflammation, which is a common symptom of rheumatoid arthritis. HRCT scans can reveal changes in the lower zones of the lungs, such as air trapping, mucus plugging, and consolidation, which can be indicative of inflammation.",1,"This question falls under category 1: Basic factual recall, either of basic science, physics, anatomy or regarding a procedure.",A,True,"I chose the lower zones (option 5) because patients with rheumatoid arthritis often develop pulmonary manifestations, and these are more commonly seen in the lower zones of the lungs. Rheumatoid arthritis can cause a variety of lung conditions, such as pleural effusion, interstitial lung disease, and bronchiectasis, which tend to affect the lower lung zones more frequently.

Acute infarctions are seen as bright areas on DWI with a corresponding low signal area on the ADC map, however in the 7-15 days following a stroke there is first pseudonormalisation and then reversal of the ADC signal. This occurs as cerebral necrosis and the increased water content of the affected tissue gives rise to T2 shine through effect. The medial posterior temporal lobe is a slightly clumsily worded anatomical location. Largely speaking if the brain tissue is adjacent to the falx it is NOT supplied by the MCA.",False,"The MRI findings in the fronto-parietal lobe indicate an acute PCA infarct, as high DWI signal and high ADC in this area are indicative of an acute ischemic infarct. The findings in the medial posterior temporal lobe indicate an old ACA infarct, as high DWI and low ADC signal in this area are indicative of an old ischemic infarct.

This question falls under 2. A question about clinical judgement, what is the correct diagnosis?",E,True,"I chose option 3 (Acute PCA infarct and old MCA infarct) because the MRI findings described in the question are consistent with this combination of infarcts.

High DWI (diffusion-weighted imaging) signal and low ADC (apparent diffusion coefficient) signal are indicative of an acute infarct, as they represent restricted diffusion due to cytotoxic edema in the acute phase of a stroke. In this case, the medial posterior temporal lobe is affected, which is supplied by the posterior cerebral artery (PCA).

On the other hand, high DWI signal and high ADC signal suggest an old infarct, as the increased ADC represents facilitated diffusion due to the chronic phase of a stroke when the tissue has already been damaged and gliosis has occurred. The fronto-parietal lobe is affected in this case, which is supplied by the middle cerebral artery (MCA).

Which SINGLE statement regarding the greater omentum is true?,SBA: Gastrointestinal,It attaches to the anterosuperior aspect of the transverse colon,The gastrophrenic ligament attaches to the underside of the right dome of the diaphragm,It is highly immobile,It has a poor vascular supply,It attaches to the underside of the liver,A,64%,16%,8%,4%,9%,"Explanation:
The greater omentum is a large, fat-laden fold of visceral peritoneum that hangs like an apron from the greater curvature of the stomach and the inferior border of the proximal half of the first part of the duodenum. It consists of a double sheet of peritoneum, folded back in on itself so that it has four layers. It descends downwards to attach to the anterosuperior aspect of the transverse colon.
The greater omentum can be subdivided according to the organ to which it attaches:
Gastrophrenic ligament â extends to the underside of the left dome of the diaphragm
Gastrocolic ligament â extends to the transverse colon (main attachment)
Gastrosplenic ligament â extends to the spleen
  The greater omentum prevents the visceral peritoneum from adhering to the parietal peritoneum lining the abdominal wall. It has considerable mobility enabling it to migrate throughout the peritoneal cavity. It is sometimes referred to as the âpoliceman of the abdomenâ because of its rich vascular supply. In cases of intra-abdominal infection or inflammation it can migrate to the affected area and wrap itself around the inflamed organ to âwall it offâ and protect other viscera. Because of its rich vascular supply it can also provide leukocytes to fight the infection.

A traumatic nerve root avulsion has been described but the remainder of the question is based in simple anatomy.
In the cervical spine the nerve roots exit above their named vertebral body; thus at the level of C4/5 it is the C5 which will be exiting. This is unlike the lumbar spine where the nerve root exits below its named vertebral body and is explained by the presence of 8 cervical nerve roots with only 7 cervical vertebra.
  A Tarlov cyst
A tarlov cyst is the name given to dilatation of the posterior nerve root sheath. They follow CSF on all sequences.
  Neuropraxia refers to a temporary nerve injury.
  Acute inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (AIDP) is a term used to describe a subtype of Guillain-Barre syndrome which is an autoimmune mediated ascending flaccid paralysis. Most imaging will be normal in such cases, with the exception of some possible contrast enhancement and thickening to the nerve roots at the cauda equina.

A syrinx is a cavity within the spinal cord. They can be post-traumatic in nature but are more often thought of as a congenital entity. There is an association with Chiari I malformations (as well as myelomeningocoele, Chiari II, Dandy-Walker and Klippel-Feil) and a finding of either a syrinx or Chiari I should trigger a search for the other.  On MRI they are seen as a CSF signal cavity running longitudinally within the spinal cord. They are associated with symptoms such as spasticity and hyperreflexia (upper motor neurone signs) to the region affected, alongside a reduction in pain and temperature sensation due to the effect on the spinothalamic tracts.  A Charcot joint, particularly of the shoulder, can result from a syrinx within the cervical cord.",True,"Nerve root avulsion is the most likely explanation as it is a common injury that occurs in a road traffic collision.

The patient undergoes an MRI scan which shows the mass to return high signal on T1 weighted sequences and low signal on T2 weighted sequences; there is shading within the mass. What is the most likely diagnosis?","SBA: Genito urinary, Adrenal, Obstetrics & Gynaecology and Breast",Endometriosis,Pelvic inflammatory disease,Krukenberg tumours,Meig syndrome,Asherman syndrome,A,94%,1%,2%,2%,1%,"Explanation:
Endometriosis
The presence of endometrial tissue outside the uterine cavity is known as endometriosis. It can be a debilitating condition, causing significant pelvic pain and is a leading cause of subfertility. Ultrasound is useful for visualising endometriomas but MRI is far better for reviewing abdominal disease and evaluating adhesions. Findings on MRI in endometriosis can be complex and variable.
  Endometrioma 
These occur as part of the spectrum of endometriosis. Although often ovarian in location they can be found in the peritoneal cavity as well as elsewhere. The ectopic endometrial tissue undergoes cyclical haemorrhage leading to a build-up of blood products and debris which gives rise to a variety of imaging characteristics. Most commonly they appear as a single cyst with posterior acoustic enhancement and homogeneous internal low-level echoes on ultrasound. On MRI the signal characteristics will vary depending on the blood content. High T1 signal suggests old blood products but must be differentiated from the fat of a potential teratoma by checking to see that the signal persists (or is not suppressed) on the fat saturated sequences. The presence of the Shading sign is very suggestive of an endometrioma and occurs when there is low signal on T2 as blood products are usually low on T2. The shading sign is useful to make the distinction from haemorrhagic corpus luteal cysts since the fresh blood in those will not have degraded sufficient to cause the T2 darkening of endometriomas.
  Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID)
This is a coverall term applied to ascending infection of the genital tract. It encompasses endometriosis, salpingitis, hydrosalpinx, pyosalpinx, and tubo-ovarian abscesses. Chlamydia and gonorrhoea account of most of the cases and the disease is most prevalent in sexually active young people. Imaging features are those secondary to inflammation with increased vascularity to the endometrium and small volume ascites. Inflammation is also seen on MRI as avid enhancement post contrast. Pelvic inflammatory disease can be complicated by a condition called Fitz-Hugh-Curtis syndrome where there is perihepatitis secondary to PID. 
  Krukenberg tumours 
A Kruckenberg tumour is a metastatic deposit from stomach cancer which causes ovarian masses. These are often bilateral and can be mistaken for primary malignancies. The histology is of a mucin producing 'signet-ring' cell cancer of which most derive from the stomach but colorectal, breast, lung, and pancreatic versions can also cause Kruckenberg tumours. On all modalities the tumours have a complex part-cystic, part-solid appearance. 
  Meig syndrome
This is a triad of an ovarian fibroma (usually, other ovarian tumours do cause it too), ascites and pleural effusions. A right sided pleural effusion is more common than the left. The underlying mechanism is unclear. Two possible explanations are that either the tumour irritates the peritoneum leading to a build up of inflammatory fluid, or that histamine release alongside other chemicals and hormones causes vasodilation and fluid exudation that way. 
  Asherman syndrome
Historically this condition was the result of infection with tuberculosis but nowadays it is more often the consequence of iatrogenic endometrial damage. The formation of intrauterine synechiae leads to subfertility and these fibrous bands can be seen on HSG as filling defects and surface irregularity. ",False,"Meig syndrome is an ovarian pathology characterized by the presence of a unilateral ovarian cyst with high signal intensity on T1-weighted sequences and low signal intensity on T2-weighted sequences, as well as internal septations and/or calcifications. The cyst is typically 5 cm or greater in diameter. The patient's symptoms of pelvic pain, combined with the ultrasound and MRI findings, indicate that Meig Syndrome is the most likely diagnosis.",2,,A,True,"I chose endometriosis as the most likely diagnosis based on the imaging findings and the patient's symptoms.

9256,205212,In a teaching session you are presented with an MRI scan which shows low T2 signal in the liver and spleen. The consultant taking the session refuses to provide you with any details of the patientâs history or presenting complaint. Which of the following would best fit with these findings?,SBA: Gastrointestinal,Haemochromatosis,Amiodarone therapy,Gauchers,Sickle Cell Disease,Wilson disease,A,75%,6%,5%,9%,6%,"Explanation:
The MRI appearance of primary and secondary haemochromatosis are not the same. The spleen is only involved in secondary haemochromatosis.
  Haemochromatosis
The primary version of this disease can be inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion. Excess dietary iron is absorbed and this accumulates in all tissues of the body leading to various different problems.
Secondary haemochromatosis can arise if patients receive numerous blood transfusions without sufficient chelation to mitigate against the iron overload.
Cirrhosis â the presence of the excess iron in the liver leads to unusual signal properties on an MRI scan. Iron is paramagnetic and causes spin dephasing. T2* and T2 sequences are particularly vulnerable to this effect but lower than expected signal will be seen on all sequences. Importantly the signal from the spleen and bone marrow should be normal. By contrast they will be involved in cases of transfusional siderosis.
Generalised osteoporosis
Hook like osteophytes on the radial aspect of the metacarpal heads â these are highly characteristic
Chondrocalcinosis, particularly affecting the knees
Insulin dependent diabetes
Congestive cardiomyopathy
Skin pigmentation
  Wilson disease
Inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion, this disease results from an excess of copper within the body due to the inability of the liver to excrete it. It can present in childhood with cirrhosis but later presentations are more likely to be due to the neuropsychiatric manifestations. Clinically adolescent or adult patients develop tremor and dysarthria due to copper deposition in the lentiform nucleus. The classic diagnostic feature is Kayser-Fleischer pigment rings in the eyes. Radiologically the following features can be seen:
Hepatic manifestations: The liver appears normal on MRI since fatty infiltration effectively cancels out the paramagnetic effects of copper
Musculoskeletal manifestations: Generalised osteoporosis, subarticular cysts, chondrocalcinosis and arthropathy which can mimic CPPD
CNS manifestations: White matter atrophy and T2 hyperintensities predominantly affecting the basal ganglia and thalami. T1 signal is also high in these areas, differentiating it from many of the other basal ganglia disorders. There is a classical feature of âsparing of the red nucleusâ leading to an appearance known as the giant panda sign at the level of the pons.
  Gaucher disease
This lysosomal storage disease is usually inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion and is around 100 times more common in Ashkenazi Jews than it is in the rest of the population. There is accumulation of glycolipid in macrophage lysosomes. The infantile form is universally lethal before 24 months of age but the adult form may be asymptomatic at diagnosis and is typically diagnosed in young adulthood if not earlier. Hepatosplenomegaly is common and co-existent with thrombocytopaenia and anaemia secondary to bone marrow failure. Osteonecrosis occurs in the femoral or humeral heads leaving serpiginous sclerotic areas or a bone-within-bone appearance. Modelling deformities such as the Erlenmeyer flask deformity (Flared metaphysis + diaphyseal thinning) also occur and are considered characteristic.
  Sickle cell disease
The signal from the spleen may be affected by haemosiderin deposition due to haemolysis within the spleen but the liver is unlikely to be affected.
  Amiodarone therapy
Amiodarone is an anti-arrhythmic drug which contains iodine (am-IOD-arone). Consequently, as it accumulates in the liver, it can cause significant increase in density to the liver on a CT scan.",True,"Haemochromatosis is a condition in which too much iron is stored in the body, leading to damage to the liver and spleen. The MRI scan findings of low T2 signal in the liver and spleen are consistent with this diagnosis, as iron can cause a decrease in the T2 signal intensity of organs on MRI.",3,"3.

Complex regional pain syndrome also known as Sudeck dystrophy
Patients develop chronic pain in an area previously affected by an, often disproportionately mild, injury. The pain is said to be burning in nature and symptoms of allodynia (pain with stimuli which would not normally be painful) and hyperalgesia (excessive sensitivity to pain) are also usually described. By contrast, reduced sensation is not normally found. On x-ray there is juxta-articular osteopenia with sub-periosteal bone resorption but preservation of the joint spaces. Soft tissue swelling can also be seen. Nuclear medicine tests may show either increased flow with increased uptake on the delayed blood pool images or (less commonly) decreased flow with decreased uptake on the delayed blood pool images.",False,"The most likely combination of findings for complex regional pain syndrome is decreased perfusion without osteoporosis. This is because complex regional pain syndrome is a condition in which the nerves in the affected area become hypersensitive and can cause pain, swelling, and changes in skin color. Decreased perfusion is a common finding in complex regional pain syndrome, as the nerves become less responsive to signals from the brain, leading to decreased blood flow to the affected area. Osteoporosis is not typically associated with complex regional pain syndrome, as it is a condition that affects the bones and not the nerves.",2,,D,True,"I chose option 4 (Increased perfusion with osteoporosis) because it best fits the clinical presentation and suspected diagnosis of complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS). CRPS is a chronic pain condition that often affects extremities like the hand and wrist after an injury, such as the fracture the patient experienced. 

In CRPS, there is an abnormal response to the injury, leading to persistent pain, swelling, and changes in skin color and temperature. Increased perfusion is a common finding in the affected area, as it reflects the increased blood flow and inflammatory response associated with CRPS. This increased perfusion can be detected on a nuclear medicine scan.

Osteoporosis is also a common finding in CRPS, as the ongoing inflammation and disuse of the affected limb can lead to a decrease in bone density. This can be seen on an X-ray as a sign of the disease progression.

Therefore, option 4 (Increased perfusion with osteoporosis) is the most likely combination of findings in this patient with suspected complex regional pain syndrome.",A,True,A,True,"[{""page_content"": ""55\nQuestion Bank\n43. \nA 28-year-old female with severe pain in both hips has a plain \nradiograph which demonstrates marked periarticular loss of \ncancellous bone.

10161,205212,A 42-year-old man is brought in after suffering a motorbike accident. He undergoes a trauma series CT scan. The radiologist on-call suspects a diaphragmatic rupture. Which of the following is LEAST likely to be seen with this injury?,SBA: Musculoskeletal and Trauma,Hourglass sign,Dependant viscera sign,Lower rib fractures,Discontinuity of the diaphragm,Associated abdominal injuries,A,35%,40%,10%,5%,9%,"Explanation:
The dependant viscera sign refers to the fact that during the trauma CT scan the patient is usually lying supine and therefore herniated abdominal viscera within the thoracic cavity lies dependant in a posterior position within the thorax.
The hourglass sign (also known as the collar sign), which is so often talked about in the literature, refers to the appearance of the abdominal viscera either side of a diaphragmatic defect with waisting seen at the site of the defect.

4. Discontinuity of the diaphragm: This is a direct sign of diaphragmatic rupture, as it indicates a tear or defect in the diaphragm.
5. Associated abdominal injuries: These are common with diaphragmatic ruptures, as the same blunt or penetrating trauma that causes the rupture can also injure other abdominal structures.

A thorough clerking and examination by a conscientious colleague of yours in A+E narrows the cause down to a possible testicular issue and you are asked to perform an ultrasound. Following appropriate consent procedures you find that the left testicle is small and homogeneously hypoechoic when compared to the right. The epididymis is enlarged and echogenic. What is the most likely diagnosis?",SBA: Paediatrics,Chronic testicular torsion,Acute testicular torsion,Missed testicular torsion,Reversed torsion,Epididymo-orchitis,A,55%,4%,34%,2%,5%,"Explanation:
Testicular torsion
Testicular torsion is a surgical emergency with salvage rates dropping sharply beyond the first six hours. A normal ultrasound scan does not exclude testicular torsion, particularly if performed within the first six hours. Acute unilateral pain beginning at night is a typical history and the peak age range is in either newborn boys or young adolescents (13-16 years). Ultrasound features, if present, are as follows:
Hypoechoic compared to the normal side (after 6 hours)
Heterogenous if there is ischaemic necrosis present (after 24 hours)
Enlarged (after 8 hours)
Absent Doppler signal (incomplete torsion can show flow)
Twisting of the spermatic cord with spiralling vessels
  Missed torsion
Where ultrasound features of heterogeneous testis with increased peri-testicular flow but absent testicular flow are found in a patient with symptoms lasting longer than 24 hours, a missed torsion can be diagnosed.
  Chronic torsion
Beyond around 10 days the testicle becomes small and homogeneously hypoechoic with an enlarged and echogenic epididymis.
  Reversed torsion also known as torsion-detorsion sequence
Increased blood flow within the testicle is either caused by infection or reversed torsion (a testicular tumour can also show increased blood flow).
  Epididymo-orchitis
Infection of the epididymis with concomitant infection of the testis is called epididymo-orchitis; it is seen most commonly in young adolescents with Chlamydia and Gonorrhoea accounting for most cases in this age range. In older patients E-coli and proteus are more likely to be responsible. Ultrasound is useful only in excluding testicular torsion as a cause of the pain (although a normal scrotal ultrasound does not exclude torsion), and investigating the possibility of abscess formation in cases refractory to antibiotic therapy. On ultrasound a reactive hydrocoele is often present and epididymal enlargement occurs. Colour Doppler flow can be used to demonstrate hyperaemia within the testicle and epididymis as would be expected for an infective process. Historically nuclear medicine scanning was used to confirm the diagnosis with findings of increased activity in the epididymis being expected owing to the hyperaemia.",False,"I chose 5 because the ultrasound findings suggest that the left testicle is small and homogeneously hypoechoic, while the epididymis is enlarged and echogenic. These findings are consistent with epididymo-orchitis, which is an inflammation of the testicle and epididymis. Testicular torsion would present with a twisted spermatic cord and a testicle that is enlarged and heterogeneously echogenic.",2,,A,False,"I chose option 2, ""Missed testicular torsion,"" because the ultrasound findings described in the scenario are consistent with this condition. The small and homogeneously hypoechoic left testicle suggests a lack of blood flow and possible necrosis, which can result from a missed or untreated testicular torsion. Additionally, the enlarged and echogenic epididymis may indicate inflammation secondary to the torsion. In acute testicular torsion, the ultrasound findings would typically show more acute changes, such as decreased echogenicity and enlargement of the affected testicle. The other options (reversed torsion, chronic testicular torsion, and epididymo-orchitis) do not match the ultrasound findings as closely as missed testicular torsion does.",C,True,A,False,"[{""page_content"": ""of the right testis.

  Bone marrow on MRI
  T1 T2
Normal bone marrow
High (fatty) Intermediate
Post-Radiotherapy
Very high and homogenous Intermediate (initially high due to oedema)
Haemangioma
High High
Abnormal bone (metastases, myeloma, regeneration)
Low but enhances with Gadolinium High (fluid)
Blastic metastases (prostate, breast, TCC) and myelofibrosis
Low Low
  Metastases
Normally metastatic deposits in the spine lead to low T1 signal and high T2 signal. There should be no signal drop out on fat saturated sequences in contrast to marrow reconversion where although red marrow will experience far less signal dropout than yellow marrow, there will still be some loss in signal owing to the fat content of both types of marrow.
Sclerotic or blastic metastases return little signal on either T1 or T2 weighted sequences. These include prostate, breast or TCC metastases among others.
Breast cancer can cause lytic or sclerotic metastases or a mixed picture.
Lytic metastases are more likely than sclerotic metastases to enhance with contrast. Similarly on DWI imaging, whereas lytic metastases will usually appear hyperintense, sclerotic metastases return little signal since they contain little water.
If there is a diffuse abnormality of the bone marrow it can be difficult to identify but normal bone marrow should not be lower in signal intensity than the muscle on T1 weighted sequences.",False,"Metastatic lesions in the thoracic vertebrae typically appear as high signal intensity on T1-weighted images and low signal intensity on T2-weighted images. This is due to the increased cellularity and increased protein content of the metastatic lesion, which leads to a higher signal intensity on T1-weighted images and a lower signal intensity on T2-weighted images. Contrast enhancement is not typically seen with metastatic lesions.",1,"3. A question about the management of a clinical situation.

Please note that the question asks for the answer that is NOT correct.
The anatomy of the middle ear is complex but important and contains a number of specific anatomical terms.

  The epitympanum, also known as the attic, is the superior portion above the highest point of the tympanic membrane. It contains the head of the malleus and the short crus of the incus (These give the appearance of an ice-cream cone on an axial CT).
  Image Â© Medical Exam Prep
  The Prussak space is found within the epitympanum and is a tiny space at the top of the tympanic membrane, just behind the scutum. Its clinical relevance is that it is the usual origin for pars flaccida cholesteatomas.
The aditus ad antrum connects the epitympanum to the mastoid antrum and thence the mastoid air cells.
The tegmen mastoidium (tegmen means roof) is the point at which the mastoid air cells meet the temporal lobe of the brain.
The tegmen tympani is the point at which the upper most extent of the epitympanum reaches the temporal lobe of the brain.
    Image Â© Medical Exam Prep
  The mesotympanum is the space posterior to the tympanic membrane and contains the body of the incus, the manubrium (connected to the tympanic membrane) and the anterior process of the malleus and the stapes. The stapes is connected to the incus as well as the oval window of the cochlea. There is also a round window placed more inferiorly which bulges to allow compression waves transmitted from the stapes to the oval window to travel through the cochlea.

14144,205212,A 31-year-old lady who is 15 weeks pregnant with her first pregnancy presents with shortness of breath and tachycardia. Full blood count and renal function tests are normal. The admitting team suspect she may have a pulmonary embolism. Which of the following is correct? Select ONE answer only.,"SBA: Genito urinary, Adrenal, Obstetrics & Gynaecology and Breast",A perfusion-only scan may be able to exclude a pulmonary embolism,A chest radiograph is not necessary because further imaging is planned,A doppler scan of the legs is not indicated even if there are symptoms of a DVT,A CTPA study will confer a greater radiation dose to the foetus of this patient than a V/Q scan,Iodinated contrast is safe to use because it does not cross the placenta,A,79%,2%,1%,11%,6%,"Explanation:
A pregnant patient suspected to have a pulmonary embolus should undergo a chest x-ray to look for alternative causes of shortness of breath such as a lower respiratory tract infection, pleural effusions or a pneumothorax. In the event that they go on to have a VQ scan a chest radiograph is required for comparison.
Thereafter the patient should undergo bilateral lower limb venous dopplers if they have signs or symptoms of deep vein thrombosis. Around a third of pregnant patients who develop pulmonary emboli will have a deep vein thrombosis and for these patients treatment can be started on the basis of their DVT diagnosis without the need for further imaging. If the patient has no signs or symptoms of a DVT, they should proceed to a VQ scan or a CTPA.
The patient should be counselled that there is a small increase in the absolute risk of the foetus developing a childhood cancer following a maternal VQ scan but also that the absolute risk of maternal breast cancer is reduced compared to a CTPA.
  CTPA
CTPA imaging confers a lower dose to the foetus than V/Q scanning, although this effect is diminished in the third trimester as the gravid uterus becomes closer to the field of view.
Unfortunately however, CTPA confers a far greater dose to the breast tissue of the mothers at a time when the tissue is more radiosensitive than it would otherwise be in a non-pregnant woman.
A secondary consideration is the use of iodinated contrast. Iodine crosses the placenta and is excreted by the foetal kidneys into the amniotic fluid. Babies of mothers who have received iodinated contrast during pregnancy should be tested during their first week of life for thyroid suppression although there is little evidence in literature to suggest that many if any infants have developed hypothyroidism following maternal intravenous iodine exposure.
Technical factors to performing a CTPA scan in pregnant patients, if required, are also important to consider. Hyperdynamic circulation can render usual triggering bolus mechanisms suboptimal and raise the possibility of a non-diagnostic study.
  V/Q or Q only scanning
V/Q scanning confers a far lower breast dose to the mother but the dose to the foetus, particularly when small, can be greater owing to tracer accumulation within the solid organs of the mother. The mother should be encouraged to adequately hydrate and void frequently in the subsequent hours/days following a scan.
Many institutes choose to perform perfusion scanning only in pregnant women on the understanding that if the perfusion scan is normal then there is no need to go on to perform the ventilation study. The perfusion scan can also be performed at half the usual dose to further reduce the foetal-dose. Naturally doing so comes with the trade-off of lower sensitivity and specificity.
  Gadolinium in pregnancy
Gadolinium also crosses the placenta and is excreted by the foetus into the amniotic fluid. The chelated form of gadolinium in itself poses no risk to the foetus however the free form of gadolinium is teratogenic and the longer the foetus is exposed to the chelated gadolinium administered for the scan, the greater the risk of each molecule of gadolinium becoming dissociated from its chelate. For this reason therefore, gadolinium should only be administered in a patient known to be pregnant, if there is likely to be significant diagnostic benefit from the resultant images.
  Considerations during lactation
Less than 1% of injected iodine or gadolinium is excreted into breast milk and less than 1% of this is then absorbed by the baby's intestinal tract. Although these amounts are considered acceptably low as to not necessitate any breast-feeding cessation advice many families are understandably over-cautious. It is accepted that contrast agents are undetectable in blood 24hours after administration and so any mother wishing to 'pump-and-dump' despite the negligible risks need not do so for longer than a day. Care should, however, be given to counsel the family that it is possible for inadvertent weaning to occur even after short intervals and this should be factored in to any decision made by the family.
Following a nuclear medicine study the risks to the baby are two-fold; firstly from tracer excretion into the breast milk, but also through proximity to the mother during breast-feeding. Recommendations for breast-feeding interruption vary depending on the half-life of the tracer used. For perfusion imaging using technetium (half-life 6 hours) breast milk should be expressed for the first 24 hours following the scan. In theory, it need not be discarded but can safely be bottle-fed to the baby after these 24 hours have elapsed, however in practice many patients none-the-less choose to discard it.
Most tracers simply require adherence to a washout time but of note, the precautions following administration of Gallium-67 based tracers (most commonly used for pyrexia of unknown origin) are much more limiting and, practically speaking, unfortunately lead to complete cessation of breastfeeding. The half-life of Ga-67 is approximately 78 hours. Breastfeeding should, if time allows, be stopped for 2-4 weeks prior to the scan to allow the breast tissue to become less radiosensitive while the tracer circulates within the mother. Where this is an unacceptably long delay for the clinical state of the patient the study can be performed straight away anyway but in either case, milk should also be discarded for at least a further two weeks following the study. Clearly a disruption to breast-feeding of such a long time is far from ideal, even assuming that a patient who is sufficiently unwell as to need a PUO study is able to continue breast-feeding at all, and is likely to lead to complete cessation of breast-feeding. There are other ways to image PUO using Tc99m labelled white blood cells which can be considered.",False,"Doppler scans of the legs are not indicated in this case because the patient's presenting symptoms are shortness of breath and tachycardia, which are consistent with a pulmonary embolism. A doppler scan would be used to diagnose a deep vein thrombosis (DVT), which is not the suspected diagnosis in this case. A CTPA study or a V/Q scan would be more appropriate for diagnosing a pulmonary embolism in this patient.",2,"3. A question about the application of knowledge to a particular clinical scenario.

3. A question about the application of knowledge to a particular clinical scenario.",D,True,"I chose option 4, ""A perfusion-only scan may be able to exclude a pulmonary embolism,"" because it is the most appropriate and safest imaging option for a pregnant patient in this scenario. A perfusion-only scan, also known as a lung scintigraphy or V/Q scan, uses a small amount of radioactive material to evaluate blood flow in the lungs. It has a lower radiation dose compared to a CTPA (computed tomography pulmonary angiography) study, making it a safer option for the fetus during pregnancy.

Calcification within the center of this lesion is a key feature which differentiates it from other lesions of plain film. Fat density on CT or MRI would also be a key differentiator.
  Geode

The lesion is situated in the lateral limb of the left adrenal gland and is 2cm in diameter. It measures 38HU on the unenhanced sequence, 115HU on the portal venous phase and 75HU on the delayed sequences. You may use a calculator. What is the absolute washout of this lesion?","SBA: Genito urinary, Adrenal, Obstetrics & Gynaecology and Breast",52%,35%,67%,49%,48%,A,77%,8%,6%,4%,5%,"Explanation:
Figures have been rounded to the nearest whole number.
Absolute washout = (115-75)/(115-38) = 52%
Relative washout = (115-75)/115 = 35%
    This lesion is non-adenomatous. Given the avid contrast enhancement on the arterial phase (>110HU) a phaeochromocytoma should be strongly suspected.
  Adrenal washout
Washout characteristics of adrenal nodules help confirm or refute a diagnosis of an adrenal adenoma. The absolute washout takes into account the initial uptake of contrast whereas the relative washout calculation is based only on how well contrast washes out of a nodule.
The underpinning principle is that vasculature within malignant lesions is more permeable than in benign lesions. This allows contrast to diffuse out of the lesion during the portal venous phase and the contrast is then slower to wash out during the delayed phase than it would be for benign lesions. Thus the higher/faster washout characteristics (either absolute or relative) the more suggestive it is that a lesion is benign.
    Phaeochromocytomas also known as adrenal paragangliomas.
Paragangliomas are found all over the body and called different things in different places despite the fact that the histology is the same.
    Phaeochromocytomas are known as the 10% tumours. Purportedly 10% are: bilateral, asymmetrical, familial, are extra-adrenal, contain calcification. The most well known syndromic association is with Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia (MEN) type II (both a and b). They do also occur with phakomatoses (von Hippel Lindau, neurofibromatosis type I, Sturge Weber and Tuberous Sclerosis).
The classic but rare presentation is of uncontrollable hypertension due to catecholamine production and the classic giveaway blood test is elevated levels of urinary VMA.
On CT they can have a range of appearances including post-haemorrhagic or necrotic low attenuation, solid and/or cystic areas. They enhance strongly and are slow to washout. On MRI they tend to return low T1 signal (excepting areas of haemorrhage which may be high) but very bright T2 signal giving rise to the lightbulb sign. The main differential diagnosis would be of adrenal cortical carcinoma. Phaeochromocytomas don't invade the IVC and won't cause atrophy of the contralateral adrenal gland, where adrenal cortical carcinomas can.
  MIBG scanning (I123-Metaiodobenzylguanidine)
This comes under the broader heading of a guanethidine analogue and can be used to pinpoint catecholamine producing tumours such as phaeochromocytomas or other paragangliomas. The scan can be used to locate an extra-adrenal phaeochromocytoma. The tracer is also taken up by neuroblastomas, carcinoid tumours and medullary carcinoma of the thyroid.
If the CT scan shows morphologically normal adrenal glands then an MRI scan is unlikely to be of any further benefit. A dedicated MRI scan of the adrenal glands with in and out of phase sequences might be useful in the setting of an indeterminate mass; if there is signal dropout within the mass it is likely to be an adenoma.
An adrenal biopsy should 'never' be performed for a suspected phaeochromocytoma. The risk is of provoking catecholamine release and triggering extreme hypertension or a cardiac arrhythmia.",True,"The absolute washout of this lesion is calculated by subtracting the delayed phase from the unenhanced phase and then dividing the result by the portal venous phase. In this case, the calculation would be (38-75)/115 = -0.52, which is equivalent to 52%.",1,"3. A question about problem solving or calculations.

This question falls under category 3: A question about problem solving or calculations.",C,False,"I chose option 2 (52%) because it is the closest percentage to the calculated absolute washout percentage (51.9%) for the adrenal lesion described in the question.

The absolute washout percentage is a parameter used in the evaluation of adrenal lesions, particularly to differentiate between benign and malignant lesions. It is calculated using the Hounsfield Units (HU) of the lesion on unenhanced, portal venous phase, and delayed phase CT images.

In this case, the provided HU values were:

- Unenhanced sequence: 38 HU
- Portal venous phase: 115 HU
- Delayed phase: 75 HU

Using the formula for absolute washout:

Absolute washout (%) = [(HU on portal venous phase - HU on delayed phase) / (HU on portal venous phase - HU on unenhanced phase)] x 100

The thoracic diaphragm is a double-domed sheet of skeletal muscle that serves as the primary muscle of respiration. It is located at the inferior-most aspect of the ribcage, acting as the floor of the thoracic cavity and the roof of the abdominal cavity.
The diaphragm is the primary muscle involved in inspiration. When it contracts, it moves inferiorly moving the abdominal viscera and increasing the volume of the thoracic cavity. This in turn decreases the intra-thoracic pressure and causes air to be drawn into the lungs. This also results in a small decrease in the volume of the abdominal cavity and slightly increases the intra-abdominal pressure.
During expiration the diaphragm passively relaxes and returns to its original shape. This restores the volume of the thoracic cavity and increases the intra-thoracic pressure.
Movements of the diaphragm also play an important role in regulating the circulation. The increase in intra-abdominal pressure and decrease in intra-thoracic pressure that occurs with inspiration resulting in an increase in venous return.",False,"Contraction of the thoracic diaphragm will result in a reduction in intra-thoracic volume, as the diaphragm contracts, it pushes down on the organs and structures within the thoracic cavity, decreasing the volume of the cavity.

In fact the demyelinating lesions seen on sagittal FLAIR sequences may be characteristic but that does not necessarily mean they are the âbestâ at depicting demyelinating plaques. âBestâ is an ambiguous term in any case as it does not differentiate between the most specific and the most sensitive test.
Some general take home points are these:
Both contrast enhancement and restriction of diffusion can be used to identity acute lesions.
FLAIR is particularly good for periventricular lesions where picking the lesions out against the CSF signal of the lateral ventricles is hardest
Corpus callosal lesions seen on sagittal FLAIR sequences are âclassicalâ
Axial T2 is âbetterâ than FLAIR for posterior fossa lesions
STIR sequences are good for spinal cord lesions
T1 pre-contrast sequences add very little information
  Multiple sclerosis
The imaging characteristics of multiple sclerosis should definitely be learnt, as much for real life radiology as for the exams. This is an idiopathic demyelinating disease with oedematous perivascular inflammation in the acute stage progressing to demyelination with proliferation of the astroglia in the chronic phase. There are oblong elliptical plaques of high T2 signal at the callososeptal interface.
Other highly testable features:
Involvement of the middle cerebellar peduncle is specific to multiple sclerosis when attempting to differentiate it from small vessel ischaemic changes
Lesions can cross the midline
Axial T2 sequences are better than FLAIR for posterior fossa lesions
Acute lesions can enhance with contrast, classically in an âincomplete ringâ
Thalamic involvement is rare and suggests the possibility of ADEM instead",True,"Axial FLAIR is the best sequence for detecting inactive demyelinating plaques because it is a T2-weighted MRI sequence that is sensitive to subtle changes in the brain, such as those associated with demyelinating plaques.

He is sent for an ultrasound scan which shows a 1cm multicystic lesion containing internal echoes adjacent to the head of the left epididymis. What is the most likely diagnosis? Select ONE answer only.,"SBA: Genito urinary, Adrenal, Obstetrics & Gynaecology and Breast",Spermatocoele,Epididymal cyst,Appendix testis torsion,Rete testis ectasia,Tunica albuginea cyst,A,80%,9%,2%,6%,3%,"Explanation:
Spermatocoele
A spermatocoele is a focal dilatation of a duct within the head of the epididymis. Since they contain protein debris and spermatozoa, low level echoes can be seen floating within them differentiating them from epididymal cysts. They are essentially an incidental asymptotic finding. They can be unilocular or multiseptate, and measure a few millimetres or a few centimetres in diameter.
  Epididymal cyst
A cystic structure within the epididymis is most commonly a simple cyst. They can present as palpable masses or be found incidentally. On ultrasound they behave as you might expect from a cyst, with posterior acoustic enhancement of an anechoic round structure. The main differential diagnosis is a spermatocoele which, unlike a simple cyst, usually contains echogenic material. The latter is usually only found in the epididymal head.
  Rete testis ectasia
This is a relatively common finding in men around the age of 60. It is asymptomatic and therefore incidental. The rete testis is the name given to the tubules which collect spermatozoa from the seminiferous tubules and deliver them to the extra-testicular ducts. The normal rete testis is too small to appreciate with ultrasound but when, through age, the distal portion becomes stenosed, there is buildup of fluid within the rete testis. This is then seen as tubular branching anechoic structures within the testis.
  Tunica albuginea cyst
The tunica albuginea is a fibrous layer covering the testicle. On ultrasound it appears as the thin echogenic line surrounding the testicle. When cysts form here they are usually palpable as small well-defined lumps a few millimetres in diameter. Appearances on ultrasound usually conform to those expected from any straightforward cyst, i.e. a sharply defined anechoic structure with acoustic enhancement posteriorly. They can be uni or multilocular and although they can exert mass effect on the underlying testicle they do not affect the testicular tissue beyond this. They are most commonly located at the anterosuperior or superolateral aspect of the testicle.
  Appendix testis torsion
The normal appendix testis sits at the superior pole of the testis between it and the epididymis. On examination a small nodule may be palpated at the correct site. The appendix testis usually measures only a few millimetres in length. If torted it will increase in size and the echogenicity will change relative to the testis (may be increased or decreased). A reactive hydrocoele is likely.",False,"I chose this answer because an epididymal cyst is the most common type of cystic lesion in the scrotal area and is typically found adjacent to the head of the epididymis.

What is the most likely diagnosis?,SBA: Central Nervous and Head & Neck,Warthin tumour,Thornwald cyst,Sjogren syndrome,HIV parotitis,Squamous cell carcinoma,A,76%,4%,4%,4%,13%,"Explanation:
Warthin tumours are associated with smoking. They also have a male preponderance.
A Thornwaldt cyst is a midline congenital pouch found in the nasopharynx of young adults. It presents as halitosis or a foul taste in the mouth.
Sjogren syndrome can cause parotid swelling and is usually unilateral when it does. It would give a cystic appearance. You would however expect the usual xerostomia and xerophthalmia too and there isnât a particular association with smoking.
HIV parotitis does give cystic parotid enlargement but it is usually bilateral and involves the whole gland diffusely rather than focally.
Squamous cell carcinoma â When these arise from the scalp and other nearby areas they can metastasize via the lymph nodes and the parotid lymph nodes represent a very common location for nodal metastasis in these cases however they are less likely to be cystic.",True,"Warthin tumour is the most likely diagnosis in this case because it is a benign cystic tumour of the parotid gland that is commonly seen in smokers. It is characterized by multiple areas of high T1 signal on MRI, which is consistent with the findings in this case.",2,,A,True,"I chose option 3, Warthin tumour, as the most likely diagnosis because the patient's presentation and imaging findings are consistent with this condition. 

Warthin tumours, also known as papillary cystadenoma lymphomatosum, are benign salivary gland tumors that typically occur in the parotid gland. They are the second most common benign parotid tumor after pleomorphic adenomas. Risk factors for Warthin tumours include older age, male gender, and a history of smoking, which matches the patient's demographics.

The ultrasound finding of a cystic parotid mass is consistent with a Warthin tumour, as they often present as well-circumscribed, encapsulated masses with cystic and solid components. The MRI finding of multiple areas of high T1 signal can be attributed to the proteinaceous or hemorrhagic content within the cystic components of the tumor.

The other options are less likely based on the patient's presentation and imaging findings:

Select ONE answer only.",SBA: Cardiothoracic and vascular,T12,L3,T11,L1,L2,A,78%,1%,4%,16%,1%,"Explanation:
The abdominal aorta is the largest artery in the abdominal cavity. It arises as a continuation of the thoracic aorta as it passes posterior to the median arcuate ligament of the diaphragm at the T12 vertebral level.
It descends caudally in the retroperitoneal space, anterior and to the left of the lumbar vertebral bodies and to the left of the inferior vena cava.
It is approximately 13 cm long and ends slightly to the left of the midline at the L4 vertebral level where it bifurcates into the right and left common iliac arteries.
The abdominal aorta has three main groups of branches:
  1. Single ventral gut arteries:
Coeliac artery (T12) â supplies the stomach, abdominal oeseophagus, liver, spleen, superior pancreas, and superior duodenum
Superior mesenteric artery (L1) â supplies the distal duodenum, jejunum. Ileum, ascending colon and part of the transverse colon
Inferior mesenteric artery (L3) â supplies the large intestine from the splenic flexure to the upper part of the rectum
  2. Paired visceral arteries:
Middle adrenal arteries (L1) â supply the adrenal glands
Renal arteries (L2) â supply the kidneys
Gonadal arteries (L2/L3) â supply the testicles/ovaries
  3. Paired wall arteries:
Inferior phrenic arteries (T12) â supply the diaphragm

13661,205212,You are reviewing a trauma series of a 21-year-old man. There is diffuse bony sclerosis on all of the images. The fingers of his hands are short and stubby. On the skull images the cranial sutures are wide and you can see that there is frontal bossing but the mandible is very small. What is the most likely diagnosis?,SBA: Musculoskeletal and Trauma,Pyknodysostosis,Osteopetrosis,Osteopoikilosis,Osteopathia striata,Melorheostosis,A,75%,19%,3%,1%,3%,"Explanation:
Pyknodysostosis
This disorder is inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion and causes diffuse bony sclerosis. Patients are of short stature and often have a typical facies; there is usually frontal bossing despite delayed closure of the cranial sutures, small mandibular size and beaking of the nose. Additionally patients have short stubby fingers, the nails of which may be hypoplastic. It can be difficult to tell pyknodysostosis from osteopetrosis however the medullary cavity is still discernible in the case of pyknodysostosis. Patients with osteopetrosis also do not tend to suffer from short stature or mandibular involvement.
Osteopetrosis
This is a disease of abnormal osteoclastic activity which leads to thick, sclerotic bone throughout the skeleton. Although appearing very solid on an x-ray, the bone is very disorganised structurally and consequently very brittle. Patients may experience numerous fractures throughout their lives. There is an autosomal dominant form which does not impede life expectancy but the autosomal recessive form carries are poorer prognosis with death due to complications of bone marrow failure (infections, leukaemia or haemorrhage) before adulthood.
On x-ray there is a generalised increase in bone density and films should be carefully evaluated for the presence of a pathological fracture. A bone-within-a-bone appearance is typical of the autosomal dominant form and there may be alternating lines of sclerosis and lucency in the phalanges.
  Osteopetrosis

  Osteopoikilosis
This benign condition leads to multiple small oval bone islands forming around the skeleton. Purportedly, once the epiphyses have fused the number remains static. They can show mildly increased uptake on a nuclear medicine bone scan. Whereas a bone island may exist in isolation or near isolation, the finding of multiple such lesions suggests the diagnosis of osteopoikilosis.

  Osteopathia striata
This disease is more similar to osteopoikilosis than the other bony dysplasias. It is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion, but can arise sporadically too. It causes striking longitudinal striations in the metaphyseal regions of the long bones but patients are generally asymptomatic and it is usually therefore an incidental finding. The appearance is said to resemble stalks of celery.
Melorrheostosis
This dysplasia gives a classical appearance said to resemble the dripping of solid candle wax along a bone. The name comes from greek words meaning 'flowing' and 'limb'. It can be asymptomatic but if there is encroachment on nerves or joints patients may present with pain and movement limitations. Uniquely for a dysplasia, it can cross from one bone to the next across a joint, sometimes causing fusion in the process. On imaging the affected 'dripping' areas are seen as slcerotic areas within the affected bones. It usually only affects one limb of the patient but changes can be seen in more than one bone of that limb (i.e. monomelic but polyostotic).",False,"Osteopetrosis is the most likely diagnosis because it is characterized by diffuse bony sclerosis, short and stubby fingers, wide cranial sutures, frontal bossing, and a small mandible. These are all signs of osteopetrosis, a condition that causes bones to become abnormally dense and thick.",2,,B,True,"I chose option 3, Pyknodysostosis, because the features described in the question are consistent with this rare genetic disorder. Pyknodysostosis is characterized by:

1. Diffuse bony sclerosis: This refers to the increased bone density seen throughout the skeleton in individuals with this condition.
2. Short and stubby fingers: This is a common feature of Pyknodysostosis, as the disorder affects bone growth and development.
3. Wide cranial sutures and frontal bossing: These are also typical findings in Pyknodysostosis, as the skull bones are affected by the disorder, leading to an abnormal skull shape.
4. Small mandible: A small or underdeveloped lower jaw is another characteristic feature of this condition.

The other options do not match the described features as closely as Pyknodysostosis does:

1. Osteopetrosis: While this condition also involves increased bone density, it does not typically present with the specific cranial and hand abnormalities described.
2. Osteopoikilosis: This is a benign condition characterized by multiple small bone islands, but it does not cause the cranial and hand abnormalities described.

Cardiac fibromas are the second most common cardiac tumor in childhood.

A previous traumatic straddle injury classically gives a short segment stricture of the bulbous urethra. In a straddle injury, the urethra is compressed against the pubic symphysis, often from a bicycle crossbar. A gonococcal infection causes a long, irregular stricture of the distal bulbous urethra.
Iatrogenic stricture
These can form following instrumentation, including prolonged catheterisation. They tend to be longer and smoother than other types of stricture. They usually occur at the main pre-existing narrow areas of the membranous urethra, bladder neck and meatus.
Infectious stricture
Gonococcal infections classically cause long strictures. They are most commonly irregular in nature and located in the bulbous urethra. The distal bulbous urethra is most frequently affected.
Radiotherapy stricture
In patients receiving radiotherapy to the perineum for prostate cancer, a urethral stricture can be a late complicating feature, occurring around 1-2 years following treatment. The stricture usually occurs at the bulbomembranous portion of the urethra, just distal to the prostate itself. Patients who have previously undergone a TURP are at increased risk of developing a post-radiotherapy stricture. They will be seen as a smooth stricture on imaging.",False,"I chose this answer because a straddle injury typically affects the penile urethra, which is the portion of the urethra that is located between the external urethral meatus and the membranous urethra. A retrograde urethrogram is a diagnostic test used to assess the anatomy of the urethra, and it can be used to identify a stricture, which is a narrowing of the urethra. A short segment stricture of the penile urethra is the most likely appearance of a stricture caused by a straddle injury.",2,"3. A question that requires problem-solving, what is the best course of action?

You are asked to perform a barium swallow to aid diagnosis and this demonstrates several linear ulcers in the lower oesophagus. What is the most likely diagnosis?",SBA: Gastrointestinal,Barrett oesophagitis,Candida albicans oesophagitis,CMV oesophagitis,HIV oesophagitis,Herpes simplex oesophagitis,A,33%,32%,10%,11%,14%,"Explanation:
The HIV status of this patient is confusing and leads candidates towards candideal oesophagitis as an answer, however this has a strong predisposition for the upper third to half of the oesophagus. Of the remaining answer options, Barrentt's fits slightly better since CMV/HIV/HSV all give round ulcers.
  Barrett oesophagus
Metaplasia of the usual squamous epithelium to columnar epithelium as a result of reflux is termed Barrett oesophagus and predisposes the patient to developing adenocarcinoma. It affects the distal oesophagus adjacent to the gastro-oesophageal junction. Long strictures can develop and on a barium swallow the mucosa appears to have a reticular pattern. Tertiary contractions may also be seen.
  Oesophagitis
Inflammation of the oesophagus usually presents with severe pain on swallowing (odynophagia). There are many different aetiologies but there are a few features which can help separate the differential diagnoses on imaging.
  Aetiology
Features
Candidiasis
 Immunocompromised patients
 Upper half of the oesophagus
 Irregular, longitudinal plaques with normal mucosa in between
Fulminant candidiasis
Patients with AIDs
Shaggy outline from a pseudomembrane of joined-together plaques
Herpes simplex
 Immunocompromised patients
 Flu-like symptoms
 Multiple small ulcers, each may have a halo of oedema
CMV / HIV oesophagitis
One large ulcer
These two are indistinguishable from one another by appearance
Caustic
 Ingestion of corrosive substance
 Affects middle and lower thirds
 Progression from oedema to ulceration to scarring over days
Barrett's oesophagitis
Columnar metaplasia of distal oesophagus in response to reflux
Long strictures
Reticular mucosal pattern
Drug-induced
Ulcers at sites of extrinsic compression in the mid oesophagus
Patients taking medication without enough water immediately prior to going to bed
Idiopathic eosinophilic oesophagitis
History of atopy usually present
Specific ring-like indentations to the oesophagus
  Glycogen acanthosis
This condition is caused by benign age-related squamous hyperplasia but, based on its imaging features, a differential diagnosis for candidiasis. On a barium swallow there will be small rounded white plaques in a random distribution, predominantly affecting the middle and upper oesophagus.

The tunica albuginea is a fibrous layer surrounding the testicle and is seen on ultrasound as a thin hyperechoic line. Disruption to the tunica albuginea (seen as loss of continuity or wrinkling) is a reasonably sensitive and specific sign of testicular rupture. Early surgical repair of the testicle is very successful at preserving both fertility and the ability of any unaffected testicular tissue to continue producing testosterone but relies on accurate and timely diagnosis. The tunica albuginea also functions as an immunological barrier protecting the testicle thereby ensuring that spermatozoa, whose haploid status identify them as 'foreign' to the host immense system, can survive. In this way the testicles are often described as being immune privileged sites. Compromise of the tunica albuginea threatens this state of affairs.
  Testicular haematoma
The sonographic appearance of a testicular haematoma varies with age. Over days to weeks following the initial insult the haematoma breaks down changing from isointense to hypointense. Colour Doppler flow is notably absent in the haematoma, when compared to surrounding viable testicular tissue. Ultrasound can be falsely negative within the first 1-2 days and a repeat scan after this time is prudent. Where haematomas are diagnosed, follow up to resolution is required since a high proportion can be complicated by either infection or necrosis either of which may require further surgical management.",False,"The disruption of the rete testes is a serious injury that requires immediate medical attention and could lead to permanent damage. This is because the rete testes are responsible for draining and circulating fluids in the testes and if they are disrupted, it can lead to infection, inflammation, and even infertility. Therefore, it is important to address this injury as soon as possible with emergency surgery.",2,"This question falls under category 2: A question about clinical judgement, what is the correct diagnosis?",C,True,"I chose option 4, ""Compromise to the tunica albuginea,"" because the tunica albuginea is the fibrous covering of the testes that helps maintain their shape and integrity.

A question about patient management, what is the correct treatment?

This question falls under 3. A question about patient management, what is the correct treatment?",C,True,"I chose option 3 (10mls) based on the following calculation:

The maximum recommended dose of 1% lignocaine (lidocaine) for an adult is 3-5 mg/kg. Assuming the patient is of average weight (70 kg), we can use the following calculation:

Max dose = 4 mg/kg (average of 3-5 mg/kg) x 70 kg = 280 mg

The initial 8mls of 1% lignocaine contains 80 mg of lignocaine (1% = 10 mg/ml, so 8ml x 10 mg/ml = 80 mg). 

Now, we need to determine how much more lignocaine can be safely given:

Remaining dose = Max dose - Initial dose = 280 mg - 80 mg = 200 mg

To convert the remaining dose from mg to ml, we divide it by the concentration (10 mg/ml):

200 mg / 10 mg/ml = 20ml

Select ONE answer only.,SBA: Musculoskeletal and Trauma,As it wraps around the head of the fibula,As it runs over plantarus,As it divides into the superficial and deep peroneal nerves,At the apex of the popliteal fossa,Beneath the edge of biceps femoris,A,92%,1%,2%,3%,1%,"Explanation:
The common peroneal nerve arises in the lower third of the thigh above the apex of the popliteal fossa, where the sciatic nerve bifurcates into the common peroneal and tibial nerves.
It passes into the popliteal fossa along the upper lateral boundary just beneath the edge of biceps femoris and runs over plantaris, the lateral head of gastrocnemius and the posterior capsule of the knee joint. Here it gives rise to two cutaneous branches, which contribute to the innervation of the skin of the leg.
It then enters the lateral compartment of the leg by wrapping around the neck of the fibula and passing between the attachments of the peroneus longus muscle. It terminates here by dividing into the superficial and deep peroneal nerves.
    Posterior view of the nerves of the lower leg showing the common peroneal nerve (from Grayâs Anatomy)
    The most common location for damage to the common peroneal nerve is at the fibular head. The commonest aetiology of a common peroneal neuropathy is habitual leg crossing. Other causes include leg positioning in stirrups during surgery, compression from short plaster casts, direct trauma, fracture of the fibular neck, and intrinsic masses (e.g. ganglionic cysts).
The principal clinical features of common peroneal nerve palsy are foot drop and loss of sensation over the dorsal surface of the foot and portions of the anterior and lower lateral leg.",False,The common peroneal nerve is a branch of the sciatic nerve that divides into the superficial and deep peroneal nerves at the apex of the popliteal fossa.

14475,205212,A 40-year-old lady is brought into the Emergency Department with neurological problems.

Select ONE option only.,SBA: Central Nervous and Head & Neck,Meningeal calcification,Soft tissue calcification around the thigh,Presentation with seizure,Cyst with a dot,Basal cistern location of lesions,A,62%,6%,2%,4%,25%,"Explanation:
Neurocysticercosis
Cysticercosis is caused by a tapeworm native to low income countries and carried by pigs. It is the most common parasitic infection involving the central nervous system and the central nervous system is itself commonly affected during the disease process; around 90% of cases show CNS involvement. The larva disseminate via the suparachnoid and intraventricular system and consequentially the meninges are most frequently affected, being involved in around 40% of cases, with particular involvement of the basal cisterns. Parenchymal involvement occurs in around a fifth of cases. The larval cells (termed cysticerci) also migrate to large skeletal muscle and, following destruction, become calcified and visible on plain radiographs as 'rice-grain' calcification. The long axis of the foci of calcification is usually orientated along the muscle fibres in which they are situated.
    Parasitic stage Features
Larval Small foci of oedema
Vesicular Small CSF cysts without surrounding oedema but containing a 2-3mm mural nodule (cyst with a dot)
Colloidal vesicular
Ring enhancing cyst with proteinaceous content
Focal seizures
Nodular granular stage Cyst shrinks and becomes isointense to brain on T1, hypointense on T2
Calcified stage
Small focal calcifications appearing 1-10 years following acute infection
Rice-like muscle calcification
Seizures or asymptomatic",False,"Soft tissue calcification around the thigh would not be consistent with a diagnosis of neurocysticercosis because this condition typically affects the brain and spinal cord, not the soft tissues of the thigh.",1,"This question falls under category 1: Basic factual recall, either of basic science, physics, anatomy or regarding a procedure.",B,False,"I chose option 1 (Soft tissue calcification around the thigh) because it is not consistent with the diagnosis of neurocysticercosis. Neurocysticercosis is a parasitic infection of the central nervous system caused by the larvae of the pork tapeworm, Taenia solium. The other options (2-5) are consistent with neurocysticercosis as they involve neurological symptoms or findings:

2. Presentation with seizure: Seizures are a common symptom in neurocysticercosis due to the inflammation and scarring caused by the cysts in the brain.
 
3. Cyst with a dot: This is a classic imaging finding in neurocysticercosis, representing the cyst containing the scolex (head) of the larva.

4. Basal cistern location of lesions: Lesions in neurocysticercosis are often located in the basal cisterns, which are fluid-filled spaces surrounding the brain.

5. Meningeal calcification: Calcification of the meninges (the protective membranes covering the brain and spinal cord) may occur in neurocysticercosis due to the chronic inflammation caused by the parasitic infection.

Acute (0-2 days) Intracellular deoxyHb Dark / Iso Dark - IDDY
Early subacute (3-7 days) Intracellular metHb Bright Dark - BIDDY
Late subacute (8-30 days) Extracellular metHb Bright Bright - BABY
Chronic (> 30 days) Intracellular haemosiderin Dark Dark rim - DODO
  In real life and for the 2b exam the important distinction is around the subacute stages.
In that case, by and large, if it is bright on T1 it is subacute and T2 then decides if it is early or late subacute. The timeframes given are also important and can form the basis of 2a exam questions.
  Of the other answers provided therefore:
Bright on T1 and dark on T2 = Early subacute
Dark on T1 and bright on T2 = Chronic
Dark on T1 and dark on T2 = Acute
Isointense on T1 and bright on T2 = Hyperacute
Bright on T1 and bright on T2 = Late subacute",False,"The correct answer is 4. Dark on T1 and dark on T2. This is because subarachnoid haemorrhage typically appears dark on both T1 and T2 weighted images. This is because of the presence of blood breakdown products, such as haemosiderin, which are not visible on T1 images but appear dark on T2 images. As the haemorrhage is chronic, the haemosiderin will have had time to accumulate and will appear dark on both T1 and T2 images.",1,"3.

3.

At around 5 days after the hemorrhage, the blood is in the early subacute phase, where intracellular methemoglobin starts to form.

Despite being meticulous with his diet he has noticed some vague abdominal pains, new weight loss and has been feeling very tired recently. His GP requests some basic blood tests which show a new iron-deficiency anaemia. On ultrasound there are multiple enlarged lymph nodes seen around the aorta and he undergoes a barium follow-through which shows marked wall thickening of a portion of small bowel. Which of the following would best fit with these findings?",SBA: Gastrointestinal,Lymphoma,Scleroderma,Mastocytosis,Whipple disease,Eosinophilic enteropathy,A,81%,1%,3%,9%,5%,"Explanation:
Fold thickness
Much is made on barium examinations, of the thickness of the folds and whether there is any nodularity. Such features can be helpful in teasing apart the possible diagnoses in similar cases.
Coeliac disease â dilatation without increase in fold thickness
Scleroderma â dilatation without loss of valvulae conniventes, prolonged transit time
Zollinger-Ellison syndrome â dilatation of the proximal small bowel due to hypersecretion
Small bowel lymphoma â fold thickening and lymph node enlargement
Mastocytosis â nodular fold thickening with sclerotic bone lesions
Crohn disease â nodular fold thickening
Whipple disease â thickened folds (+/- microndularity) without dilatation, with normal transit time
  Small bowel lymphoma
Malignancies of the small bowel are rare but lymphoma is the most common of these. Coeliac disease, infection with H. Pylori and AIDs both predispose patients to developing small bowel lymphoma. Perhaps surprisingly patients do not present with obstruction even when the tumour burden is large, similarly neoplastic perforation is not common. Instead patients present with insidious symptoms or haemorrhage. On imaging there is (sometimes extensive) thickening of the bowel wall, often with associated lymph node enlargement.
  Differential diagnosis for lymph nodes of low attenuation
Coeliac disease â cavitating mesenteric lymph node syndrome
Tuberculosis
Whipple disease
Lymphoma
Necrotic metastases
  Whipple disease also known as intestinal lipodystrophy
Infection with Tropheryma whipplei causes a migratory arthralgia with jejunal fold thickening leading to malabsorption and is known as Whipple disease. Skin hyperpigmentation is often described and peripheral lymph nodes may be enlarged. Micronodularity does occur on the thickened folds but crucially there is little or no small bowel dilatation and a normal transit time. Obstruction of the lymphatics leads to low density lymph nodes appearing on CT. PAS positive macrophages confirm the infection.
  Mastocytosis
Mast cells store histamine (among other things). Where they exist in excess the resultant symptoms fit with excess histamine release. Patients complain of nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, hypotension, flushing and abdominal pain. Asthma-type symptoms can also occur. On imaging hepatosplenomegaly and lymph node enlargement are common. The walls of the small bowel become thickened and malabsorption occurs too. Mastocytosis is also a cause of bony sclerosis.

Paget disease
  Eosinophilic enteropathy
This is a rare condition caused by infiltration of eosinophils into the wall of the small bowel. Patients often suffer from food allergies and experience multiple attacks of abdominal pain, diarrhoea and vomiting in a relapsing/remitting pattern. Blood eosinophil levels are usually raised. On imaging the folds of the small bowel can appear thickened.
  Scleroderma
Scleroderma is a multi-system connective tissue disease leading to fibrosis and loss of smooth muscle. In the gastrointestinal system this leads to the hidebound sign (similar but different to stacked coin sign which is seen in intramural haematoma where the folds are thickened) where, despite being dilated in calibre, the small bowel still retains the valvulae conniventes which would otherwise be effaced. This is thought to result from fibrosis of the longitudinal layer causing foreshortening along the long axis. In the small bowel there can also be the formation of square-shaped broad-based sacculations (true-diverticulae because they involve all layers of the bowel wall) on the mesenteric border of the bowel is seen owing to uneven atrophy of the smooth muscle there. A prolonged transit time would be ususal. Pseudosacculations (wide-mouthed diverticulae) are found in the colon but this time on the antimesenteric border. (The *only* anti-mesenteric diverticulum of the small bowel is a Meckel's diverticulum.)
 ",True,"Lymphoma is the best fit with these findings because it is a type of cancer that affects the lymph nodes, which is what was seen on ultrasound. Iron-deficiency anemia is a common symptom of lymphoma, as is weight loss and fatigue. The barium follow-through showing wall thickening of a portion of the small bowel is also consistent with lymphoma.",3,"3. A question about the application of knowledge, what is the best course of action?

This question falls under option 3: A question about the application of knowledge, what is the best course of action?",A,True,"I chose option 5, Lymphoma, because the patient's symptoms and test results best fit with this diagnosis. The patient has a history of coeliac disease and has been following a gluten-free diet, but is still experiencing new symptoms such as vague abdominal pain, weight loss, and fatigue. The blood tests show iron-deficiency anemia, which can be associated with gastrointestinal malignancies, including lymphoma.

Additionally, the ultrasound shows multiple enlarged lymph nodes around the aorta, which is another finding that can be suggestive of lymphoma. The barium follow-through also reveals marked wall thickening of a portion of the small bowel, which can be seen in lymphoma as well.

The other options do not fit the patient's presentation as well:

1. Scleroderma - This is a connective tissue disorder that typically affects the skin and internal organs, but the patient's symptoms and imaging findings do not align with this condition.
2. Mastocytosis - This is a rare disorder characterized by an abnormal accumulation of mast cells in various tissues, but the patient's symptoms and imaging findings do not fit this diagnosis.
3. Whipple disease - This is a rare bacterial infection that primarily affects the small intestine, leading to malabsorption. While some symptoms may overlap with the patient's presentation, the imaging findings do not support this diagnosis.
4. Eosinophilic enteropathy - This is a group of disorders characterized by eosinophilic infiltration of the gastrointestinal tract.

Renal tuberculosis
In areas of the world endemic to tuberculosis, renal tuberculosis is a reasonably common presentation of extra-pulmonary disease. The appearances on imaging vary depending on the disease timeline. The classical âputty kidneyâ of renal tuberculosis is an end-stage appearance where there is dystrophic calcification affecting all parts of the kidney. At this point the kidney has usually become shrunken and small and the final appearance is of so-called autonephrectomy when there is essentially no parenchymal tissue left, just amorphous calcification. An earlier manifestation is stenosis to the infundibuli connecting the calyces to the renal pelvis causing proximal dilatation of the calyces which are seen to be clubbed on a urogram. Purportedly, the earliest sign is of moth-eaten calyces owing to uneven erosion to the papillae.
  Xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis (XGP)
This curious condition results from chronic pyelonephritis and leads to a non-functioning kidney. Chronic infection (most commonly with Proteus or e-coli) induces a granulomatous process whereby the renal tissue eventually becomes replaced by a mass of reactive tissue. Since proteus infection is one of the main causes it is not surprising that many cases present with a staghorn calculus. The exact association varies from 30-90% depending on the data source. The other finding on CT is of multiple low attenuation rounded areas with Hounsfield Units (HU) of around -15 to -20. These are the dilated calyces filled with debris and xanthoma collections and they cause the whole kidney to be enlarged. The appearance is said to resemble a bearâs paw. Patients can present either on a background of recurrent UTIs or potentially renal colic. Vague malaise and weight loss may be the presentation in the absence of direct urinary symptoms.
  Malakoplakia
Directly translated from Greek, malakoplakia just means soft plaques. These are actually submucosal inflammatory plaques consisting of basophilic PAS positive inclusion bodies and incompletely destroyed e-coli bacteria. The giveaway pathological term is Michaelis-Gutmann inclusion bodies which are the incompletely destroyed e-coli bacteria surrounded by a lipoprotein membrane. Although malakoplakia can occur in anyone, patients with diabetes mellitus or immunosuppression are predisposed to it. Importantly though, it is not a pre-malignant condition unlike leukoplakia. On imaging there are filling defects in the bladder and distal ureters. These are usually small, measuring only a few millimetres across.
  Leukoplakia 
Directly translated from Greek, leukoplakia just means white plaques. It is a squamous metaplastic condition affecting the transitional cell epithelium of the bladder. Presentation is usually as a consequence either of recurrent urinary tract infections or urinary tract calculi. Sometimes patients complain of passing flaky white tissue in the urine which is pathognomonic for this condition. On imaging there is mucosal thickening and filling defects within the bladder. Some sources consider leukoplakia to be a premalignant condition for epidermoid carcinoma.
  Schistosomiasis
Schistosoma larvae burrow through human skin and travel via the lymphatics to the lungs and liver to mature. Thence they continue onto the pelvic vessels where eggs are deposited in the bladder wall. There the eggs cause both a granulomatous and an inflammatory reaction which erodes through the bladder mucosa and the eggs are then excreted in the urine. The disease is endemic to many parts of Africa.
The dominant imaging feature is of bladder wall calcification. This is usually described as curvilinear or floccular and involves all of the layers of the bladder. Owing to the chronic fibrotic reaction the bladder eventually becomes restricted and small; thus the standout imaging feature is of a small calcified bladder. The main differential diagnosis of bladder wall calcification is tuberculosis.
Another important facet to these cases is the risk of bladder cancer developing in the context of chronic inflammation. These cancers are squamous cell carcinomas and should be actively looked for in cases of schistosomiasis; there is a latent period of approximately 20 years prior to development.",False,"Xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis (XGP) is a chronic infection of the renal pelvis and calyces that is caused by the accumulation of lipid-laden macrophages. It is usually caused by a bacterial infection, most commonly by Proteus mirabilis, and is characterized by the presence of cloudy urine and leukocytes in the urine. The KUB ultrasound and IVU findings of infundibular stenosis and calyceal clubbing are typical of XGP. Therefore, Xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis is the most likely diagnosis in this case.",2,,B,False,"I chose Schistosomiasis as the most likely diagnosis for the following reasons:

1. The patient's history of traveling around the world during her gap year raises the possibility of exposure to parasites, including Schistosoma, which is known to cause urinary schistosomiasis. This condition is prevalent in certain regions of the world, particularly in Africa, South America, and Asia.

2. The patient's symptoms of cloudy urine, general tiredness, and unwell feeling are consistent with Schistosomiasis. The presence of 3+ leucocytes in the urine without nitrites also suggests an inflammatory process, which could be due to a parasitic infection.

3. The abnormal KUB ultrasound findings of infundibular stenosis and calyceal clubbing in the right kidney are consistent with Schistosomiasis. In urinary schistosomiasis, the Schistosoma eggs can cause inflammation and fibrosis in the renal pelvis and calyces, leading to these findings.

4. The other options listed do not fit the patient's presentation and history as well as Schistosomiasis:

- Xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis is a rare, severe form of chronic pyelonephritis, typically associated with recurrent urinary tract infections, which the patient does not report.
- Malakoplakia is a rare inflammatory condition that affects the urinary tract and is associated with impaired immune function, which is not mentioned in the patient's history.
- Leukoplakia is a precancerous lesion that typically affects the oral cavity, not the urinary tract.
- Tuberculosis can affect the kidneys, but the patient's history and symptoms are more suggestive of Schistosomiasis.

Please note that the question asks which is NOT a likely diagnosis.
The differential diagnosis for orbital pathology is heavily anatomically based.

Retinal detachment
Outside the globe there are three conditions which are included in all of the other orbital compartments namely sarcoidosis, pseudotumours and lymphoproliferative lesions.

    Lymphoproliferative disorders include leukaemias, lymphomas, and less aggressive collections of lymphoid tissue. The term is used particularly in head and neck radiology where histological diagnosis of such entities is key. Some masses on a CT scan can have a 'typical' appearance for a lymphoma but are actually only benign lymphoid hyperplastic tissue and thus the term lymphoproliferative disorder covers both entities accurately.
IgG4 related diseases are one of Radiologyâs newest entities.

Select ONE option only.,SBA: Central Nervous and Head & Neck,Rice-grain calcification around the thigh,Thin serpiginous calcification in the web spaces of the hand,Comma shaped calcification in the paraspinal muscles,Sheets of calcification over major joints,Thick serpiginous calcification adjacent to the ankle joint,A,86%,3%,8%,2%,2%,"Explanation:
Neurocysticercosis
Cysticercosis is caused by a tapeworm native to low income countries and carried by pigs. It is the most common parasitic infection involving the central nervous system and the central nervous system is itself commonly affected during the disease process; around 90% of cases show CNS involvement. The larva disseminate via the suparachnoid and intraventricular system and consequentially the meninges are most frequently affected, being involved in around 40% of cases, with particular involvement of the basal cisterns. Parenchymal involvement occurs in around a fifth of cases. The larval cells (termed cysticerci) also migrate to large skeletal muscle and, following destruction, become calcified and visible on plain radiographs as 'rice-grain' calcification. The long axis of the foci of calcification is usually orientated along the muscle fibres in which they are situated.
    Parasitic stage Features
Larval Small foci of oedema
Vesicular Small CSF cysts without surrounding oedema but containing a 2-3mm mural nodule (cyst with a dot)
Colloidal vesicular
Ring enhancing cyst with proteinaceous content
Focal seizures
Nodular granular stage Cyst shrinks and becomes isointense to brain on T1, hypointense on T2
Calcified stage
Small focal calcifications appearing 1-10 years following acute infection
Rice-like muscle calcification
Seizures or asymptomatic
    Other parasitic calcifications within soft tissues:
Armillifer - comma shaped, found within the muscles of the trunk
Loa loa - serpiginous thread, found in the web spaces of the hand
Guinea worm - thicker serpiginous, especially around the lower limbs
Dermatomyositis characteristically causes sheet-like calcification, often overlying large joints.",True,"Rice-grain calcification is a common feature of neurocysticercosis, which is a parasitic infection of the central nervous system caused by the tapeworm Taenia solium. This type of calcification is seen in the form of multiple, small, round, and discrete calcifications, which are typically located in the subarachnoid space, around the ventricles, and in the brain parenchyma.

The inferior vena cava carries deoxygenated blood from all of the structures lying below the diaphragm into the right atrium of the heart. It arises as the union of the right and left common iliac veins at the L5 vertebral level.

It pierces the central tendon of the diaphragm at the T8 vertebral level to enter the thorax. It then almost immediately enters the pericardium before draining into the right atrium.

13807,205212,A 67-year-old man presents with fullness in his nasal passage. Examination demonstrates a large nasal mass and he undergoes further imaging to investigate. A homogenous mass in the nasal cavity is seen which is uniformly low in signal on T2. There is adjacent bony destruction. What is the most likely diagnosis?,SBA: Central Nervous and Head & Neck,Sinonasal lymphoma,Antrochoanal polyp,Esthesioneuroblastoma,Nasopharyngeal angiofibroma,Metastatic melanoma,A,44%,17%,14%,11%,15%,"Explanation:
The main differential for a nasal mass is as follows:
  Sinonasal (non-Hodgkin) lymphoma
This most commonly affects older people (60s and older). It is commonly seen in the nasal cavity rather than the sinuses. There will be a homogenous mass with bony destruction which returns low signal on T2 weighted sequences.
By contrast, the lymph nodes of a patient with Hodgkin lymphoma usually return high signal on T2 weighted sequences. These patients are typically younger, in their 20-40s.
  Squamous cell carcinoma
This is the most common malignancy of sinonasal track. The maxillary antrum is involved in 80% of cases. It is often seen as an aggressive antral soft tissue mass, which is low in signal on T2.
  Nasopharyngeal angiofibroma
This affects 'exclusively' adolescent male patients. There will be dark flow voids on T1 weighted sequences and the mass will be brightly enhancing. Radiation therapy treats this in 80% of cases, and interventional radiological embolisation can be used to treat haemorrhagic complications at presentation if required.
  Esthesioneuroblastoma
This tumour has a bimodal distribution, affecting people in their 20s and 60s. There is a dumbbell shaped tumour with waist at the cribriform plate. The mass will brightly enhance.
  Antrochoanal polyp
This occurs in young adults with obstructive nasal symptoms. They arise from the maxillary sinuses and causes widening of the maxillary ostium. ",False,"Esthesioneuroblastoma is a rare neuroendocrine tumor that arises from the olfactory epithelium. It is most commonly seen in the nasal cavity and is characterized by a homogenous mass that is low in signal on T2 imaging, as well as adjacent bony destruction. This is the most likely diagnosis based on the clinical presentation and imaging findings.",2,,C,False,"I chose option 5, Metastatic melanoma, because the clinical presentation and imaging findings are consistent with this diagnosis. 

The patient is an older adult with a large nasal mass and adjacent bony destruction. These features suggest a more aggressive lesion, which is more likely to be malignant. In addition, the homogenous mass with uniformly low signal on T2-weighted MRI images is characteristic of melanoma, as melanomas tend to have low signal intensity on T2-weighted images due to their high melanin content.

The other options are less likely based on the provided information:

1. Sinonasal lymphoma: Lymphomas usually present as intermediate to high signal intensity on T2-weighted images, not uniformly low signal intensity as described in this case.
2. Antrochoanal polyp: Polyps are typically benign and do not cause bony destruction. They also tend to have high signal intensity on T2-weighted images.
3. Esthesioneuroblastoma: This tumor typically originates in the superior nasal cavity or cribriform plate, and its signal intensity on T2-weighted images can be variable, not uniformly low as described.
4. Nasopharyngeal angiofibroma: This benign tumor predominantly affects adolescent males and is not typically associated with bony destruction. It also tends to have high signal intensity on T2-weighted images.

9001,205212,A 48-year-old man undergoes a CT scan for follow up at 12 months post resection of an adrenal malignancy. His past surgical history also includes resection of a parathyroid tumour. The CT shows a solitary pancreatic mass with significant enhancement on the arterial phase. What is the most likely diagnosis?,SBA: Gastrointestinal,Glucagonoma,Adenocarcinoma,Adrenal metastasis,VIPoma,Choledochal cyst,A,66%,9%,5%,19%,0%,"Explanation:
Pancreatic Islet cell tumours
Insulinomas account for almost half of these with gastrinomas making up most of the remainder. Glucagonomas are the next most common after that. When the tumours are functioning, i.e. Producing the hormones after which they are names, then they present at a relatively small size with patients reporting symptoms pertaining to the respective hormones. Non-functioning tumours are far larger when they present. Islet cell tumours show striking arterial enhancement on CT and when they metastasize, often to the liver, the metastases show similar arterial enhancement. They may be of low reflectivity with a bright hyperechoic rim if seen in ultrasound but ultrasound is a poor modality for imaging the upstream pancreas. On MRI the tumours return low signal on T1 and high signal on T2 with strong arterial contrast enhancement. 
The classic clinical picture with glucagonomas can be summarised as the 4 Ds namely, Diabetes, Deep vein thrombosis, Depression and Dermatitis although this is relatively rare. Most patients develop an unfortunate condition called necrolytic erythema migrans which is an intensely itchy maculopapular rash. Although less common than insulinomas and gastrinomas, glucagonomas are associated with MEN as well.
VIPomas cause a watery diarrhoea and hypokalaemia termed Verner-Morrison syndrome. They are not usually considered to be associated with MEN though rare cases have been noted. 
  Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia (MEN)
There are three types of MEN and all are inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion. Defects in tumour suppression genes on either chromosomes 10 or 11 allow the development of multiple neoplastic lesions affecting multiple endocrine organs. The syndromes overlap making them challenging to distinguish but they are separate entities and lend themselves well to MCQs. Interestingly where parathyroid hyperplasia is present in 97% of patients with MEN 1, medullary carcinoma of the thyroid is present in just shy of 100% of MEN 2A.

  Choledochal cyst
Reflux of pancreatic enzymes into the common bile duct  leads to weakening of the wall of the common bile duct [CBD] (+/- the common hepatic duct) and thereafter aneurysmal dilatation termed a choledochal cyst. There are five different subtypes. Patients are mostly diagnosed in childhood.  If undiagnosed to adulthood patients present with a triad of episodic jaundice, right upper quadrant pain and a right upper quadrant mass.
Type I â This is by far the most common version. The common bile duct is affected either focally or along its entire length.
Type II â A true diverticulum of the CBD
Type III â Focal dilatation of the CBD contained within the wall of the duodenum. This type is also called a choledochocoele. They present slightly later with most patients being in their 30s at the time of diagnosis and can be seen as a duodenal filling defect on barium follow-through studies.
Type IV â The intrahepatic and extrahepatic biliary ducts are affected
Type V â The intraheptic ducts are affected alone. This is termed Caroli disease however there is some discrepancy in the literature as to whether this can be called a type V choledochal cyst or whether it is a separate disease in its own right. Caroli disease (cavernous ectasia of the intrahepatic ducts) can be inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion. When present it is quite striking on imaging with saccular dilatation of most of the larger intrahepatic biliary ducts alongside focal strictures giving a beaded appearance. There is an association with medullary sponge kidney and patients are at significantly increased risk of developing cholangiocarcinoma.
  Adrenal metastasis
Secondary adrenal malignancies are more common than primary ones and the second most common adrenal lesion overall(after adenoma). The main four cancers to metastasize to the adrenal glands are four of the most prolific cancers namely: breast, colon, lung and pancreas. Of the remaining cancers, malignant melanoma can metastasize to the adrenal glands. The appearance of an adrenal metastasis varies hugely. They can be relatively low in attenuation on CT owing to a degree of central necrosis. Whereas adenomas tend to washout on multi-phase imaging, metastases often display far slower washout characteristics.
  Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma
Unfortunately pancreatic adenocarcinoma has a poor prognosis and is also reasonably common. At the time of diagnosis only 10% have surgically resectable disease and the 5 year survival rate is pitifully low at 2-3%. The classical specific presentation is with painless jaundice (Courvoisier sign â painless jaundice and a right upper quadrant mass is unlikely to be caused by gallstones) however most patients actually present with vague abdominal or right upper quadrant pains. The tumour markers usually found are CEA and Ca19-9.  Smokers, obese patients and those with a relevant oncological family history  of hormonal cancers are at increased risk of developing the cancer, as are those suffering from cancer syndrome such as HNPCC (hereditary non polyposis colorectal cancer). On ultrasound the tumour will show low reflectivity compared to any adjacent normal pancreatic tissue. On CT the masses tend to enhance poorly.
The key to management is operability. Involvement of various different local structures excludes or potentially excludes some patients from surgical management as follows:
Operable
Borderline operable
Palliative
Duodenum
Veins â IVC, SMV and Portal vein
SMA
Spleen
Arteries â aorta, splenic artery if further than 1cm from origin,
Coeliac axis
 ",False,"The most likely diagnosis is adenocarcinoma, which is the most common type of pancreatic cancer.

11031,205212,A 41-year-old man complains to his GP of worsening shortness of breath and increased sputum production. He has never smoked. Abnormalities on his CXR prompt analysis with CT which shows panacinar low attenuation regions bilaterally with a lower lobe predominance. What is the most likely diagnosis?,SBA: Cardiothoracic and vascular,Alpha 1 antitrypsin deficiency,Lymphangioleiomyomatosis,Congenital lobar hyperinflation,Swyer-James syndrome,Neurofibromatosis,A,91%,3%,1%,3%,2%,"Explanation:
Alpha 1 antitrypsin deficiency
Alpha-1 antitrypsin is a glycoprotein which is made in the liver and secreted. One of its functions in the lungs is to oppose the action of proteolytic enzymes the likes of which are secreted by white blood cells in order to counter sub-clinical bacterial infections. Since A1AT is deficient in these patients the unopposed action of the enzymes goes beyond the intended destruction of pathogenic bacteria and causes damage to the lung tissue. Patients are usually diagnosed in early adulthood when their symptoms develop. On CT there is panacinar emphysema, particularly affecting the bases. Bronchiectasis is also often seen. Cirrhosis is another feature of this disease and should be looked for on imaging. 
  Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM)
LAM can go misdiagnosed for many years as emphysema. It occurs exclusively in non-smoking women of childbearing age and quite often a history of spontaneous pneumothorax is given. Radiologically there are numerous small cystic spaces surrounded by normal lung. A chylous pleural effusion (negative Hounsfield units) is reasonably specific. The main differential diagnosis would be histiocytosis which tends to be associated with smoking, classically spares the costophrenic angles and gives small nodules but both can present with spontaneous pneumothorax and give small cysts. The lung volumes in LAM will remain normal whereas they can be increased in Histiocytosis (surprisingly for a fibrotic lung disease).
  Congenital lobar overinflation (previously congenital lobar emphysema)
This condition is thought to be caused by underdevelopment of bronchial cartilage in the affected lobe(s). Consequently the bronchus is unable to remain patent during expiration leading to significant air trapping. It is usually the left upper lobe which is affected but approximately 40% of cases involve the left upper lobe; the right middle or the right upper lobes are affected in a further 55% of cases. There is a reasonable male preponderance of approximately 3:1.
On a CXR there is hyperlucency of the affected lobe and often mass effect on the mediastinum leading to contralateral mediastinal shift and thereby respiratory distress.
  Swyer-James syndrome
In this condition, normal development of the infant lung is impeded by bronchiolitis (viral or mycoplasma) at an early age, with superadded acute airspace destruction. Consequently the affected lobe is small and lucent on the CXR due to air trapping. It is a differential diagnosis for a unilateral lucent hemithorax, along with a pneumothorax, very large pulmonary emboli and causes of decreased chest wall musculature such as Poland syndrome or, historically, polio. In an an exam situation Swyer-James syndrome is usually given as a teenage or young adult patient with a history of recurrent LRTIs. Air trapping, and bronchiectasis can also be described.
  Neurofibromatosis
Technically neurofibromatosis (type I) is included in the differential diagnosis for lung cysts (particularly in the upper lobes) however the rest of the information provided is insufficient to make this the most likely answer here.",False,"I chose this answer because Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) is a rare lung disease that causes panacinar low attenuation regions bilaterally with a lower lobe predominance, which is consistent with the patient's symptoms and CT results.

9651,205212,"A 17-year-old boy, recently arrived in the UK from Kenya, visits his GP complaining of a lump around his elbow. His GP examines him and notes a chalky material exuding from the skin overlying the mass. She requests an x-ray which shows a densely calcified mass around the elbow, although the rest of the imaged skeleton appears normal. What is the most likely diagnosis?",SBA: Paediatrics,Tumoral calcinosis,Gout,Parosteal osteosarcoma,Secondary hyperparathyroidism,Tertiary hyperparathyroidism,A,82%,8%,6%,3%,1%,"Explanation:
Tumoral calcinosis
Surprisingly for the sometimes extreme appearance of this condition, it can be completely painless. Patients are typically black and in their teens or 20s. Around a third of cases are inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion. A biochemical defect in the metabolism of phosphorus leads to accumulation of hydroxyapatite fluid around the joints causing a foreign-body type granulomatous reaction and fibrous capsule development. On imaging this appears as a progressive and calcified soft tissue mass. The skin overlying the mass can ulcerate and exude a chalky or milk like fluid. Any or all of the hips, shoulders and elbows can be affected but characteristically tumoral calcinosis does not affect the knees. Importantly the underlying bones are normal, a feature which differentiates it from gout or pseudogout.
  Gout
Excess circulating urate levels leads to crystalisation of urate (monosodium urate crystals) within the joint spaces. An acute attack may be precipitated by any acute event such as trauma or surgery as well as a change in diet to include purine containing foods (liver, kidney, game meat, some seafood, alcohol). Historically chronic manifestations of this condition included the development of gouty tophi; white lumpy areas under the skin which could ulcerate and exude a chalky material. These are still seen today but far less so thanks to improved management strategies. Involvement of the first metatarsophalangeal joint is considered classical but involvement of the carpometacarpal joints of the hands is often most debilitating where it occurs. On x-ray the earliest radiological manifestation is a joint effusion. Joint erosions develop on the lateral corners of a joint, but contrary to many other erosive processes the base of the ulcers has a sclerotic margin. Juxta-articular osteopenia is not often seen, a feature which acts as a good distinguisher from rheumatoid arthritis, which is thought to be because the attacks come in acute bursts during which time disuse osteopenia does not have the time to develop. Another reasonably specific feature of gouty arthritis is the preservation of the joint space itself until relatively late into the disease.

  Hyperparathyroidism
Parathyroid hormone acts to increase calcium levels either by promoting reabsorption in the kidneys or by acting on the osteoclasts of the bones and leads to increased bone resorption. This is seen as generalised osteopenia and cortical thinning, particularly of the subperiosteal bone.
Primary hyperparathyroidism is usually caused by an autonomous adenoma (alternatively parathyroid hyperplasia or a parathyroid carcinoma). Medullary nephrocalcinosis is most commonly caused by primary hyperparathyroidism but does also occur with secondary and tertiary hyperparathyroidism.
Secondary hyperparathyroidism is a hyperplastic response of the parathyroid glands to the high phosphate and  low calcium levels which accompany renal osteodystrophy. Soft tissue calcification is very much a feature of renal osteodystrophy. Confusingly the high circulating levels of phosphate in renal osteodystrophy leads to dystrophic mineralisation of trabecular bone which is seen as sclerosis; hence renal osteodystrophy is a cause of generalised increase in bone density despite hyperparathyroidism being a cause of osteopenia.
Tertiary hyperparathyroidism occurs when a patient with secondary hyperparathyroidism (i.e. chronic overstimulation of the parathyroid glands) goes on to develop an autonomous adenoma.
  Renal osteodystrophy
In the context of chronic renal failure there are three different mechanisms at work which give rise to a collection of different musculoskeletal manifestations. These are:
Osteomalacia or rickets
Secondary hyperparathyroidism (Brown tumours, subperiosteal bone resorption, soft tissue calcification, bony sclerosis)
Aluminium toxicity if the patient is on dialysis
Generalised increase in bone density
Renal osteodystrophy is a differential diagnosis for generalised increase in bone density and this can be the most striking finding, or indeed the only finding, for these patients. In the spine the end-plates can be particularly affected which leads to the appearance known as ârugger jersey spineâ.
Soft tissue calcification
This most commonly affects the main organs: heart, lungs, kidneys. It can also occur around joints as fluffy cloud-like densities.
Looser zones
These are insufficiency fractures from normal stress applied to abnormal bone. They occur at 90o to the cortex and in characteristic locations such as the pubic rami, the medial aspect of the femoral neck, the lateral aspect of the scapulae, and the ribs. They are not unique to renal osteodystrophy though; they can also be found in fibrous dysplasia, Paget disease and osteogenesis imperfecta.
Brown tumours
Haemosiderin deposition from localised haemorrhage gives these lesions their name. They are osteoclastomas rather like Giant Cell Tumours which form when there is rapid bone loss in a given area due to high parathyroid hormone levels acting on osteoclasts. On plain film they appear as well defined lytic lesions which can expand the cortex but do not destroy it.
Pepperpot skull also known as salt and pepper skull
This is a feature of hyperparathyroidism and is seen when patchy resorption of trabecular bone in the skull leaves behind tiny lucencies.
Rickets
In the unfused skeleton the effects of abnormal calcium and phosphate levels manifests in many ways. There is widening of growth plates with metaphyseal cupping and fraying. Bowing of weight bearing bones is not uncommon.
  Osteosarcoma
Secondary osteosarcomas
Paget disease
Bone infarct
Osteochondroma
Osteoblastoma
Radiotherapy change
  These are bone forming tumours which can either be primary, or secondary. Primary osteosarcomas occur in young patients or young adults when the bones are more active during adolescence than in later life, and have a predilection for either the proximal tibia or distal femur i.e. around the knee joint. Secondary osteosarcomas occur as malignant degeneration of pre-existing bone lesions. Clinically they present as a painful mass with a fever. Pain on movement is also typical. In later disease patients may have a raised serum ALP. On x-ray they are poorly defined aggressive lesions with sunburst periosteal reaction and fluffy cloud-like osseous matrix. For staging the patient should receive an MRI of the entire of the affected bone (to rule out synchronous lesions), a nuclear medicine bone scan and a CT chest. Tissue biopsy should only be performed at tertiary referral centres where to mitigate the risk of seeding the biopsy tract, immediate tissue analysis with the option of immediate amputation can be performed.

Uncontrolled hypertensive attacks
  Phaeochromocytomas are known as the 10% tumours. Purportedly 10% are: bilateral, asymmetrical, familial, are extra-adrenal, contain calcification. The most well known syndromic association is with Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia (MEN) type II (both a and b). They do also occur with phakomatoses (von Hippel Lindau, neurofibromatosis type I, Sturge Weber and Tuberous Sclerosis).
The classic but rare presentation is of uncontrollable hypertension due to catecholamine production and the classic giveaway blood test is elevated levels of urinary VMA.
On CT they can have a range of appearances including post-haemorrhagic or necrotic low attenuation, solid and/or cystic areas. They enhance strongly and are slow to washout. On MRI they tend to return low T1 signal (excepting areas of haemorrhage which may be high) but very bright T2 signal giving rise to the lightbulb sign. The main differential diagnosis would be of adrenal cortical carcinoma. Pheochromocytomas don't invade the IVC and won't cause atrophy of the contralateral adrenal gland, where adrenal cortical carcinomas can. 
  MIBG scanning -(I123-Metaiodobenzylguanidine)
This comes under the broader heading of a guanethidine analogue and can be used to pinpoint catecholamine producing tumours such as pheochromocytomas or other paragangliomas. The scan can be used to locate an extra-adrenal pheochromocytoma. The tracer is also taken up by neuroblastomas, carcinoid tumours and medullary carcinoma of the thyroid.

  If the CT scan shows morphologically normal adrenal glands then an MRI scan is unlikely to be of any further benefit. A dedicated MRI scan of the adrenal glands with in and out of phase sequences might be useful in the setting of an indeterminate mass; if there is signal dropout within the mass it is likely to be an adenoma.
An adrenal biopsy should 'never' be performed for a suspected pheochromocytoma. The risk is of provoking catecholamine release and triggering extreme hypertension or a cardiac arrhythmia.
  Adrenal adenoma
These present a diagnostic challenge if only to rule out a malignant adrenal mass. Once the diagnosis is confirmed they can then be left alone and do not require any further imaging. The majority are obvious on CT and obviously adenomas. Owing to their high fat content most adenomas show low Hounsfield units (HU) and HU <18 on an unenhanced study has a sensitivity of 85% and a specificity of 100%.
In cases where the fat content is insufficient to make the diagnosis an adrenal protocol CT can be performed. This compares the HU on an unenhanced scan, a portal venous phase scan and a 15 minute delayed phase scan. From these values the absolute washout can be calculated by comparing the difference between the two contrast studies with the amount of contrast taken up in the first place (i.e. the difference between the portal venous phase and the unenhanced phase). The relative washout is calculated by comparing the difference between the two contrast studies to just the portal venous phase (i.e. it is relative to the portal venous phase).
An alternative diagnostic strategy which, but for demand management, is better for patients as far as dose preservation is concerned, is an MRI scan. The fat content of adrenal adenomas shows up well as signal loss on out-of-phase imaging and gives a chemical shift artefact in the frequency encoding direction on both gradient echo and spin echo sequences.  On gradient echo sequences due to the chemical shift a black line appears in all directions and is termed the India Ink effect or etching artefact.

  Adrenal metastasis
This is an important differential diagnosis for a malignant lesion of the adrenal gland. Lung cancer is the most obvious culprit but other cancers do also metastasize to the adrenal glands (Breast, Colorectal, Renal cell, Malignant melanoma, Pancreas). Metastases take on a variety of appearances depending on their cell type but usually retain contrast for longer than adenomas leading to low washout figures. Owing to their neoplastic nature they are however, usually reasonably vascular and therefore show strong enhancement in the portal venous phase (>100HU). On an MRI scan they enhance with gadolinium but importantly fail to show any signal loss on fat suppression sequences.
  Adrenal cortical carcinoma
These present either as large incidental masses or, in around half of cases, secrete hormones and are found during investigations for their effects. Cushing syndrome, Conn syndrome or virulisation are the predominant consequences. They present in adulthood, often around the age of 50 and can be quite large by the time they are diagnosed, although those that produce hormones are often picked up earlier and consequently do not reach the impressive sizes seen with their more inert counterparts. Bizarrely they are seen in association with astrocytomas and less bizarrely they can occur as part of Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia (MEN). On CT they will be seen as a suprarenal heterogeneous mass with modular peripheral enhancement. Areas of low attention are seen when necrosis has occurred and calcification can sometimes be seen. Where calcification is present in a suprarenal mass it is a strong indicator of malignancy. Adrenal washout is used more for the detection of phaeochromocytomas and proving the benignity of adenomas but adrenal cortical carcinomas do retain contrast leading to low washout percentages - a relative washout of <40% would be expected. Scans must be scrutinised for evidence of invasion of the IVC, diaphragm or kidney.
MRI findings are not all too dissimilar to CT namely heterogeneity with limited contrast washout. They are usually hyper-intense on both T1 and T2 when compared to the liver.

13942,205212,You are performing an ultrasound scan on a 60-year-old woman and notice a liver lesion. You suggest characterisation with MRI as your hospital does not offer contrast-enhanced ultrasound. On the MRI scan the liver is small and irregular in outline but the lesion is slightly higher in intensity than the rest of the liver on the T2 weighted sequences. There is strong arterial enhancement with Primovist but on the hepatobiliary phase sequences the lesion returns little signal. What is the most likely diagnosis?,SBA: Gastrointestinal,Hepatocellular carcinoma,Focal Nodular Hyperplasia,Haemangioma,Hepatic abscess,Focal fatty infiltration,A,77%,10%,11%,1%,1%,"Explanation:
Gadoxetic acid disodium (Primovist) and gadobentate disodium (MultiHance) are hepatobiliary specific MRI contrast agents. They are taken up by hepatocytes.
The hepatobiliary phase is taken at approximately 20mins following contrast injection. At this point, with Primovist, only normal hepatocytes (and FNHs) should retain the contrast. Malignant lesions such as HCC will have washed-out.
  Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)
Although metastases are the most common cause of malignant hepatic lesions, hepatocellular carcinoma is the most common primary hepatic malignancy. It usually arises on a background of cirrhosis of any cause. Patients with any of the hepatitis viruses, alcoholic cirrhosis, haemochromatosis, and Wilson disease are all at risk. Carcinogens such as thorotrast and aflatoxin also predispose to HCC formation. Serum alpha fetoprotein levels are often raised, in contrast with cholangiocarcinomas which are one of the main differential diagnoses.
On imaging HCCs can have a variety of appearances. A large irregular mass with satellite nodules is the most common finding but a diffuse infiltrative version can also occur. Since HCCs derive their blood supply from the hepatic artery they show arterial enhancement on CT with washout on later phases. On ultrasound HCCs tend to be hypoechoic when compared to the rest of the liver and on MRI they show variable signal intensity on both T1 and T2 but arterial enhancement with venous washout can again be seen once Gadolinium has been given. Usually they return slightly higher signal on T2 than the remainder of the liver.
Fibrolamellar carcinoma of the liver is a specific subtype which occurs in slightly younger patients with otherwise normal livers. It is an echogenic lobulated mass on ultrasound with a central fibrous scar which does not enhance on CT. The lack of enhancement, and sometimes presence of calcification, within the scar separates it from fibrous nodular hyperplasia which is the main differential diagnosis. On MRI the scar returns low signal on T1 and T2 owing to its fibrous nature.
Thorotrast is a carcinogenic historic contrast agent used in the 30s and 40s. Its use was abruptly curtailed once it was realised that it is retained indefinitely in the reticuloendothelial system. It causes hepatocellular carcinomas and cholangiocarcinomas, but hepatic angiosarcomas are the most frequently quoted related malignancies.
  Haemangioma
Cavernous hepatic haemangiomas are the most common solid benign liver lesions and the second most common liver lesion overall (after secondary tumours). Pathologically they are composed of large vascular channels in which the blood flows very slowly. They are usually supplied by the hepatic artery which goes some way to explaining their enhancement characteristics. With all contrast studies three different types of enhancement can be seen.
Flash haemangiomas â these show immediate and uniform enhancement which persists on delayed sequences (unlike hypervascular tumours which wash out)
Peripheral nodular enhancement on arterial imaging with complete filling in on delayed images
Peripheral nodular enhancement with incomplete filling in â this usually occurs in giant (>5cm diameter) haemangiomas where the central portion is thrombosed.
  On ultrasound they are usually well-defined hyperechoic compared to normal liver parenchyma. Contrast enhanced ultrasound is coming to the forefront of diagnosis for solitary hepatic lesions, relieving some of the burden of MRI. Haemangiomas show either flash filling or peripheral nodular increased reflectivity followed by a gradual total or near total filling in when microbubble contrast is given.
On MRI the slow flowing blood causes very high signal on T2 weighted images, higher than the spleen and high enough to cause T2 shine through on diffusion weighted images. Conversely although metastases will also show high T2 signal they do not usually outshine the spleen in this regard. Similarly to contrast enhanced ultrasound findings for a haemangioma, the pattern of gradual filling in is replicated with gadolinium-based contrast agents on an MRI scan although on the delayed phase of a hepatobiliary specific contrast agent the lesion will be low in signal as haemangiomas do not contain normal hepatocytes.
Nuclear medicine studies can be useful in the diagnosis of heamangiomata. Sulphur colloid studies will show a photopenic area initially which 1-2hours later shows increased uptake.
  Focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH)
These lesions typically occur in women in late middle age. They are not caused by oral contraceptive use however they do enlarge in response to hormone stimulation. They are composed of hyperplastic hepatocytes and are thought to arise when a small underlying congenital vascular malformation means that an area of the liver receives a better blood supply and therefore grows better, thus they lack a true capsule but can outgrow their blood supply resulting in the classical central fibrous scar which is present in around half of cases. On imaging they do demonstrate mass effect, displacing adjacent vessels, have marked arterial enhancement which fits in with their supposed aetiology. The central scar enhances only on delayed sequences. On MRI they tend to return high signal on T2 weighted sequences. Their appearance on contrast enhanced ultrasound is interesting; the central scar enhances very early in the arterial phase, branching out in a spoke-wheel type of appearance. During the main arterial phase the lesions enhance strongly before becoming isoechoic in the portal venous phase. On the delayed hepatobiliary phases the lesions are shown to have retained contrast while the adjacent normal liver parenchyma will gradually wash out.  They are the only hepatic lesions to do this.

    Hepatic Adenoma
These benign masses are caused by hormone use (including anabolic steroid use) although they can arise without such exposure. They are composed of hepatocytes without portal tract or bile ducts. Kupffer cells are also absent meaning they do not take up hepotocyte-specific MRI agents such as Primovist. Like FNH they can have a central scar but unlike FNH they have a fibrous pseudocapsule seen on ultrasound as a hypoechoic rim surrounding the otherwise (usually but not always) hyperechoic mass. They have a tendency to outgrow their blood supply which can result in spontaneous haemorrhage (this is often the presenting feature). CT is useful in this regard, as an acute imaging technique however adenomas show arterial enhancement much like FNH making the diagnosis difficult. MRI using Primovist is therefore more useful. On the unenhanced images adenomas are isointense to the rest of the liver on T1, and loses signal on out of phase images much like FNH however adenomas do not enhance with Primovist where FNHs do.
  Focal steatosis also known as focal fatty infiltration
The liver plays a small role in fat storage and subtle variation in blood supply and drainage between different areas can lead to variations in the amount of fat in those areas. Focal fatty change is very common and has a geographic appearance on all imaging modalities, with a lack of mass effect (ie preservation of the vascular architecture). It can occur anywhere within the liver but is classically found adjacent to the falciform ligament (i.e. segments II, III and IV). Fat-identifying sequences on MRI can be very useful to cinch the diagnosis with signal drop out on out-of-phase images. Focal fatty sparing on the other hand appears as the inverse of this and on CT will be seen as isoattenuation on a background of a diffusely hypoattenuating liver. On ultrasound the liver will be diffusely hyperechoic when compared to the right kidney, and the spared area will be hypoechoic.
  Hepatic abscess
Liver abscesses can occur in children, for much the same reasons as they arise in adults, although they are far more common in adults. In neonates they may arise as a complication from a misplaced umbilical venous catheter. Pyogenic abscesses result from bacteria accessing the liver via the biliary tree, septicaemia, direct spread, trauma or during a liver procedure. Adult patients are usually in their 60s. Amoebic abscesses occur in slightly younger patients (40s) and tend to result from spread of amoebae from the colon via the portal venous system. On ultrasound abscesses appear as a hypoechoic mass with posterior acoustic enhancement. Internal debris may be apparent. On CT they are usually low in attenuation and may have a rim of enhancing tissue depending on the phase of the contrast. MRI signal characteristics are dependent on the protein content of the pus but usually abscesses return little T1 signal and, owing to their fluid nature, return high signal on T2 weighted sequences. It is said that amoebic abscesses are usually found to be contiguous with the liver capsule.
 ",True,"The most likely diagnosis of a liver lesion with slightly higher intensity than the rest of the liver on T2 weighted sequences, strong arterial enhancement with Primovist, and little signal on the hepatobiliary phase sequences is hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).

Myositis ossificans
Trauma to the muscle causes local haemorrhage and necrosis of damaged muscle. The sequelae of this is calcification which can persist long-term. Large muscles are particularly prone to this and the typical patient is a young, active adolescent. Myositis ossificans appears as a calcified soft tissue mass underlying the area of clinical concern. A periosteal reaction may or may not be present but crucially there is no erosion of the underlying cortex, a fact which discriminates it from malignant fibrous histiocytoma. The string sign refers to the presence of a plane of normal tissue separating the mass from the bone and unlike a parosteal osteosarcoma, in myositis ossificans this plane will extend along the whole length of the mass completely separating it from the bone.
Myositis ossificans has different appearances at different time-frames post-injury. It begins as amorphous calcification and then develops a sharper cortical margin after approximately 2 months. Classically it further calcifies occurs from the outer rim inwards. This is significant as it is in contrast to a parosteal osteosarcoma which demonstrates central calcification and peripheral lucency.",False,Myositis ossificans is a condition in which a mass of bone forms in a muscle due to trauma or inflammation. The most specific pattern of calcification for this condition is a well-defined mass with central calcification. This means that the mass has a clearly defined border and the calcification is concentrated in the center of the mass. This pattern of calcification is seen in myositis ossificans and can help differentiate it from other conditions that can cause similar symptoms.,1,"3.

11221,205212,You are performing a hysterosalpingogram on a 37-year-old lady with primary infertility. The uterine cavity outlines normally but you notice irregularity and multiple diverticuli of the fallopian tubes bilaterally. There is no spill. What is the most likely diagnosis?,"SBA: Genito urinary, Adrenal, Obstetrics & Gynaecology and Breast",Salpingitis isthmica nodosa,Pelvic inflammatory disease,Actinomycosis,Tuberculosis,Asherman syndrome,A,85%,6%,2%,3%,4%,"Explanation:
Salpingitis isthmica nodosa 
The aetiology of this condition is debatable but has been linked with previous pelvic inflammatory disease. There is a strong association with infertility and, where pregnancy does arise, with ectopic implantation. Nodular thickening affects the fallopian tube, with particular prevalence in the proximal two thirds. This leads to a classical appearance on HSG of multiple tiny diverticuli, with no spill of contrast distally. 
  Asherman syndrome
Historically this condition was the result of infection with tuberculosis but nowadays it is more often the consequence of iatrogenic endometrial damage. The formation of intrauterine synechiae leads to subfertility and these fibrous bands can be seen on HSG as filling defects and surface irregularity. 
  Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID)
This is a coverall term applied to ascending infection of the genital tract. It encompasses endometritis, salpingitis, hydrosalpinx, pyosalpinx, and tubo-ovarian abscesses. Chlamydia and gonorrhoea account of most of the cases and the disease is most prevalent in sexually active young people. Imaging features are those secondary to inflammation with increased vascularity to the endometrium and small volume ascites. Inflammation is also seen on MRI as avid enhancement post contrast. Pelvic inflammatory disease can be complicated by a condition called Fitz-Hugh-Curtis syndrome where there is perihepatitis secondary to PID. 
  Tuberculous pelvic inflammatory disease
TB tends to affect the Fallopian tubes, causing many separate strictured points which causes a beaded appearance on HSG.  On CT the presence of calcified pelvic lymph nodes may point at the diagnosis.
  Actinomycosis
Various species of actinomyces reside within the gastrointestinal and genitourinary tracts without causing any problems however opportunistic infections can occur when there is a breach to the mucosa. Thus pelvic actinomycosis tends to be consequent from events such as IUCD placement, surgery or trauma. Broadly speaking the imaging features will be those of pelvic inflammatory disease with pelvic fat stranding on CT, intraperitoneal free fluid and possible tubo-ovarian abscess formation. The density of any free fluid is pertinent only insofar pointing towards an infective cause go. Other causes of increased free fluid density would be haemorrhage or a high protein content.",True,"Salpingitis isthmica nodosa (SIN) is a condition characterized by the presence of multiple nodular lesions in the fallopian tube, which can lead to infertility. The nodules are caused by inflammation of the mucosa and can be seen on hysterosalpingogram (HSG) as irregularity and multiple diverticuli of the fallopian tubes bilaterally. The lack of spill on the HSG is also a typical finding in SIN.

Immunocompromised patients (including long term steroid therapy)
Upper half of the oesophagus
Irregular, longitudinal plaques with normal mucosa in between
Fulminant candidiasis
Patients with AIDs
Shaggy outline from a pseudomembrane of joined-together plaques
Herpes simplex

Progression from oedema to ulceration to scarring over days
Barrett oesophagitis
Columnar metaplasia of distal oesophagus in response to reflux
Long strictures
Reticular mucosal pattern
Drug-induced
Ulcers at sites of extrinsic compression in the mid oesophagus
Patients taking medication without enough water immediately prior to going to bed
Idiopathic eosinophilic oesophagitis
History of atopy usually present
Specific ring-like indentations to the oesophagus
  Glycogen acanthosis
This condition is caused by benign age-related squamous hyperplasia but, based on its imaging features, a differential diagnosis for candidiasis. On a barium swallow there will be small rounded white plaques in a random distribution, predominantly affecting the middle and upper oesophagus. Patients are typically middle aged or elderly.
  Intramural pseudodiverticulosis
This is a feature of candidal oesophagitis. Tiny diverticulae are found scattered along the length of the oesophagus and on a barium swallow the appearance can be quite impressive!

13853,205212,A 19-year-old woman suffers an ankle inversion injury. She has no bony tenderness but has difficulty weight bearing and the ankle is very swollen. You have been asked to review her X-rays and  suspect that she has a ligament injury without a bony injury. Which SINGLE statement regarding the ligaments of the ankle is true?,SBA: Musculoskeletal and Trauma,The anterior talofibular ligament inserts into the lateral aspect of the talus,The deltoid ligament inserts into the base of the 1st metacarpal,The deltoid ligament is thinner than the lateral collateral ligament,The posterior talofibular ligament resists over-eversion of the foot,The deltoid ligament arises from the lateral malleolus,A,64%,10%,4%,13%,9%,"Explanation:
The ankle has two sets of ligaments, which originate from each malleolus:
1. The medial (deltoid) ligament:
This is a multi-banded ligament that lies on the medial side of the ankle. It attaches proximally to the medial malleolus. It consists of four separate ligaments that fan out distally to attach to the talus, calcaneus and navicular. Its primary action is to resist over-eversion of the foot.
2. The lateral ligament:
The lateral collateral ligament is made up of three individual bands that all arise from the lateral malleolus. It resists over-inversion of the foot. The insertions of the three ligaments are as follows:
The anterior talofibular ligament: lateral aspect of the talus
The posterior talofibular ligament: posterior aspect of the talus
The calcaneofibular ligament: calcaneus
  The medial collateral (deltoid) ligament is much thicker and stronger than the lateral collateral ligament and less commonly injured.
Gravity stress radiographs assess the integrity of the deltoid ligament in lateral malleolar ankle fractures without talar shift.

There is a differential diagnosis for lytic lesions of the skull.
  Parietal foramina
This is a benign congenital condition where the parietal bones fail to completely ossify leading to paired defects in the characteristic para-sagittal location. There are usually no clinical consequences.
  Eosinophilic granuloma causes round punched-out type lesions, usually described as having a bevelled edge. These would usually be solitary although multiple lesions are definitely possible. The symmetry of the lesions described in the question goes against this on grounds of probability though.
  Fibrous dysplasia can affect the skull. It is usually described as having a ground glass appearance with cortical expansion and a swell-defined sclerotic margin.
  Osteogenesis imperfecta is not usually part of the differential diagnosis for lytic lesions in the skull. Multiple wormian bones are part of the diagnostic criteria and at a stretch leptomeningeal cysts caused by skull fractures due to fragility could be brought into the picture.
  Sinus pericranii is largely a soft tissue (vascular) mass which can cause secondary effects on the skull, including a localised defect. Again though, bilateral symmetrical defects would be unusual.",True,"Parietal foramina are the most likely diagnosis because they are symmetrical, well-circumscribed lucencies seen posteriorly in the skull vault.

Certain occupations predispose patients to developing rotator cuff tears. These tend to be those that involve overhead work or sports that involve overarm motions (baseball, swimming etc).
The tendon passes over the long head of biceps in the rotator interval and also merges distally with the fibres of the coracohumeral tendon. It is most likely to tear distally at its anterior most portion.

The classical feature of a cavernoma (aka cavernous haemangioma) on MRI is the âpopcornâ appearance caused by a bright lobulated centre surrounded by a rim of hypointensity. Haemosiderin deposition causes the blooming artefact on susceptibility weighted sequences. It is perhaps slightly counterintuitive that there can be no enhancement on post-contrast CT scans, given the vascular nature of these lesions, however when we consider that flow within the lesion may be very slow then this makes a little more sense. Another important distinguishing feature from other lesions is the fact that, unlike metastases, there is no mass effect or oedema from these lesions, despite the fact that they can often present with seizures.
Cerebral amyloid angiopathy gives rise to micro-haemorrhages at the grey-white matter junction which are well seen as blooming artefact on susceptibility weighted sequences.",True,"I chose this answer because a cavernoma is the most likely diagnosis based on the imaging findings.

14204,205212,A 12-year-old boy undergoes a contrast enhanced CT scan for further investigation of an anterior mediastinal mass which was found on a chest radiograph. Within the abdomen and pelvis the scan also shows bilateral low density renal lesions. What is the most likely diagnosis? Select ONE answer only.,SBA: Paediatrics,Lymphoma,Tuberculosis,Teratoma,Seminoma,Askin tumour,A,75%,3%,10%,6%,6%,"Explanation:
Lymphoma
This is the most common anterior mediastinal mass in children. It may be difficult to differentiate a lymphoma from normal thymus, particularly in a patient younger than 10 years of age. Associated lymphadenopathy (i.e. cervical) can be the key to distinguishing the two pathologies. Calcification is rare prior to any treatment but can be a feature of lymphoma which has been treated.
  Renal lymphoma
Renal lymphoma may be seen as an incidental finding or in the context of a pre-existing non-Hodgkin lymphoma study. Involvement of the kidneys can be either via haematogenous spread or direct extension from retroperitoneal lymph nodes. The appearances on CT tend to fall into one of a few different categories despite there being little difference in the type of lymphoma.
By far the most common pattern is that of multiple bilateral masses. The masses tend to enhance poorly with contrast and are therefore seen as low attenuation against the normal renal parenchyma.
A large solitary mass mimicking a renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is another type of renal lymphoma presentation. These will usually be more homogenous in appearance than an RCC although there is much overlap in appearances of the two.
Contiguous retroperitoneal extension can appear quite drastic on a CT scan. Often associated with bulky lymph nodes in the retroperitoneum there is a homogeneous soft-tissue mass encasing the renal vessels which can usually still be seen running through the mass even when it is significantly large.
Perirenal disease is odd in so far as it can leave the renal parenchyma itself relatively unharmed. It appears as low attenuation surrounding the kidney at may at first casual glance, be mistaken for a urinoma.
Infiltrative disease can be a subtle finding when there is bilateral renal enlargement. The key finding is that although enlarged, the kidneys retain their âreniformâ shape. Infiltrative lymphoma is the most likely of the above to cause a decline in renal function. Usually kidneys infiltrated with lymphoma would appear hypoechoic, not echogenic.
  Germ Cell Tumour
This often causes a large anterior mediastinal mass. It can be subdivided into Teratoma (usually cystic with fat and calcification), seminoma (bulky and lobulated) and Non-seminomatous Germ Cell Tumour (haemorrhage and necrosis).
  Askin Tumour
These heterogenous tumours are part of the Ewing Sarcoma spectrum. Patients are often in their early teens. Askin tumours displace rather than invade adjacent mediastinal structures although rib destruction is common and is a fact which can help distinguish it from a pleuropulmonary blastoma which is another cause of a large mediastinal mass, albeit usually found in babies under the age of 2, but which does not cause rib destruction.",False,"Seminomas are a type of germ cell tumor that usually occur in the testicles, but they can also occur in the mediastinum.

Arterial bleeding from pelvic fractures
Pelvic fractures in the context of trauma are a cause of significant morbidity and mortality. Life threatening haemorrhage may be caused by arterial bleeding or other sources such as the fractured bones themselves, and the pelvic venous structures. External fixation is one of the few means of managing acute haemorrhage in the pre-hospital setting however for arterial bleeding it is far less effective at tamponading ongoing haemorrhage. It remains the treatment of choice for bone bleeding or venous bleeding.
Catheter angiography and embolisation is the most effective method to control arterial haemorrhage. If the patient is haemodynamically unstable due to an arterial pelvic haemorrhage, catheter embolisation still provides the best hope for managing the patient successfully. Even if the patient has abdominal injuries which are likely to necessitate open abdominal trauma surgery, studies have shown that arterial pelvic bleeding should still be controlled via catheter embolisation prior to their open surgery.",True,"Angiography and embolisation is the best option for managing this type of pelvic fracture with active haemorrhage from an internal iliac artery branch. Angiography will allow for visualization of the artery and allow the physician to accurately identify the source of the bleed.

11771,205212,On the ward round of the neonatal intensive care unit a baby is reviewed. She was born four weeks ago at 31+4 weeks gestation. She has been receiving mechanical ventilation but her CXRs have been gradually worsening. The latest one shows hyperinflation of both lungs with coarse linear lucencies. Focal areas of emphysema can also be seen. There are no pleural effusions. What is the most likely diagnosis?,SBA: Paediatrics,Bronchopulmonary dysplasia,Transient tachypnoea of the newborn,Meconium aspiration,Pulmonary interstitial emphysema,Hyaline membrane disease,A,48%,1%,2%,45%,5%,"Explanation:
This question comes down to either BPD or PIE as both can occur in neonates and the radiological features overlap. It would therefore perhaps be unfair to be asked to choose between them in the real exam. The timing fits BPD well and as a general rule, the clinical deterioration from BPD is more gradual; with PIE it is more sudden. On this basis, the correct answer for this question should be given as BPD.
----------------------
Of the five main respiratory conditions of the neonate the differential diagnosis can be narrowed based on gestational age. The presence of hyperinflation can also be useful but may not always be present where feasible so should not be used as an absolute discriminator. If present, it is useful.
    Meconium aspiration
Meconium is sticky and causes a chemical pneumonitis in the lungs, seen as patchy consolidation. In addition small globules of meconium entering bronchi and bronchioles of a decreasing calibre act as a ball-valve mechanism and lead to air trapping; thus the lung volumes of a baby with meconium aspiration may be increased. Air bronchograms are notably absent. The typical baby in a meconium aspiration situation is post-term.
  Transient tachypnoea of the newborn (TTN)
The classical patient for TTN would be a term baby born by caesarean section to a diabetic mother. During normal vaginal delivery the compression of the baby as it descends the birth canal acts to squeeze fluid out from its lungs. This mechanism is all but absent during a caesarean section. Consequently these babies are born with an excess of retained fluid. The CXR of an affected baby will show bilateral symmetrical air space opacification with air bronchograms, fluid in the fissures and pleural effusions. This peaks in severity at 24hrs but resolves by three days.
  Hyaline Membrane Disease (HMD) also known as surfactant deficient disease (SDD)
It is to reduce the likelihood of this disease developing that a woman in pre-term labour will be offered a steroid injection. The steroids help the neonatal lungs to develop faster and increase the likelihood of their being able to produce surfactant once delivered. Where there is surfactant deficiency the alveoli collapse. The CXR will show a granular opacification throughout both lungs which progresses to bilateral ground glass opacification with air bronchograms. If exogenous surfactant is given to the baby there may be asymmetrical improvement in the appearances depending on how much reaches each lung. Of note HMD does not cause pleural effusions. Finally a normal CXR at 6hrs post delivery excludes HMD.
  Pulmonary interstitial emphysema (PIE)
As the name would suggest, this disease is diagnosed when there is air within the interstitial tissues of the lungs. It is caused by alveolar rupture due to the barotrauma of mechanical ventilation or positive airway pressure. It can be associated with hyaline membrane disease and is prevalent in infants of a low birth weight. Complications such as pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum can be severe and acutely life threatening. Radiographically there is hyperinflation and lucencies in either a cystic pattern or streaks emanating from the hila and following the direction of the bronchi/bronchioles. It is treated with high frequency oscillation ventilation which is less traumatic to the lungs.
  Bronchopulmonary dysplasia
This also occurs due to barotrauma in ventilated neonates but is a more gradual process, occurring later on in the babyâs life. Typically (but not exclusively) the baby is premature (hence requiring ventilation). It only usually occurs after the baby in question has received ventilation of >21% oxygen for longer than 28 days. The lungs are hyperinflated and what starts off as ground glass opacification becomes complete opacification with air bronchograms in a few days. After 30 days it can be seen as coarse linear lucencies, described as radiating from the hila, with focal emphysematous change. Mikity syndrome has similar features but occurs in term infants who have not received mechanical assistance.",True,Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is the most likely diagnosis for this baby. BPD is a chronic lung disease that can develop in preterm infants due to the effects of mechanical ventilation and other treatments used in the neonatal intensive care unit. The CXR findings of hyperinflation of both lungs with coarse linear lucencies and focal areas of emphysema are consistent with BPD.

Subacute combined degeneration
This is a curious condition which can be subtle to detect. A deficiency of vitamin B12 (usually caused by malabsorption) leads to degeneration within the dorsal columns of the cord. The dorsal columns carry nerves responsible for position and vibration sense and as such patients present with loss of these senses as well as sensory ataxia (balance significantly deteriorates when the patientsâ eyes are shut thereby excluding visual stabilisation as opposed to sensory stabilisation), and hyperreflexia.
On an MRI scan there will be (if the resolution allows), a longitudinal line of high T2 signal within the cord on sagittal sequences, and often a characteristic 'inverted-V' shape of high T2 signal on axial sequences. In some cases, the 'V' is clearly seen and in others it is harder to appreciate and the finding is more of high T2 signal bilaterally and symmetrically in the region of the posterior columns.

  Spinal cord infarction
The vascular supply to the spinal cord is derived largely from the vertebral arteries or intercostal arteries with one longitudinal running anterior spinal cord artery and two small longitudinally running posterior spinal cord arteries.
The artery of Adamkiewicz is a particularly large segmental artery supplying the anterior spinal artery from around the level of T9. It is responsible for most of the spinal cord blood supply for the lumbar spinal cord. Damage during aortic surgery or trauma can result in spinal cord infarction.
Usually any vascular insult results in a reasonably rapid onset of symptoms. Spinal cord infarctions are no exception. Often more than one vertebral level is affected.
An MRI will show T2 hyperintensity of at least the central grey matter (if not the whole cross-section of the cord) due to oedema. As with intracranial infarctions there will be restriction of diffusion on the DWI sequences.
Particularly in the thoracic spine, the adjacent vertebral body may also lose its blood supply and undergo infarction.
 ",True,"The inverted-V shape of high T2 signal in the posterior columns is highly suggestive of subacute combined degeneration of the cord. This is because the high T2 signal is indicative of an inflammatory process, which is a hallmark of this condition.

There is global cerebral atrophy and on the T2 weighted sequences there is blurring of the pars compacta in the midbrain. The nuclear medicine study shows reduced uptake in the posterior putamina bilaterally. What is the most likely diagnosis? Select ONE answer only.,SBA: Central Nervous and Head & Neck,Parkinson's disease,Alzheimer's disease,Pick's disease,Huntington's disease,Lewy body dementia,A,74%,6%,3%,8%,9%,"Explanation:
Parkinson's disease
Generalised cerebral atrophy occurs with Parkinson's disease but is a highly non-specific feature. There are, however, radiological findings in the midbrain which although subtle, are far more specific. Parkinson's disease occurs when there is neuronal loss in the substantia nigra, specifically the pars compacta of the substantia nigra. On a T2 weighted MRI image this appears as blurring of the intermediate signal intensity line which separates the two adjacent low intensity structures (these are the pars reticulata of the substantia nigra and the red nucleus).
A DAT scan (Dopamine Active Transfer) can be performed to confirm the diagnosis. This uses the radiopharmaceutical I-123 Ioflupane to image dopamine transporters in the brain. These are present in the highest concentrations in the putamina and caudate nuclei. In patients with true Parkinson's disease (as opposed to other similar conditions), there will be loss of uptake in the posterior putamen. This can be an asymmetric finding. Colloquially speaking the appearance of these areas on a normal patient resembles a comma and on a patient with Parkinson's disease they become more like full stops.

    There are two anatomical areas of the brain which are particular important in the field of neurodegenerative nuclear medicine.
The cingulate gyrus - next to the corpus callosum
The precuneus - between the cingulate sulcus and the parieto-occipital sulcus
  Image Â© Medical Exam Prep
  Pick's disease is also called frontotemporal dementia
As the name would suggest, the main abnormalities are seen in the frontal and temporal lobes, including the anterior part of the cingulate gyrus. These areas show low metabolism on PET studies. The posterior part of the cingulate gyrus and the precuneus are spared.
  Lewy body dementia
A core clinical feature to this dementia is the fluctuant nature of the symptoms. Parkinsonian features can also develop although these are usually subsequent to the memory decline. Visual hallucinations are also a feature.  Radiologically there is a generalised decrease in cerebral volume (sparing the hippocampi). Temporo-parietal hypoperfusion on HMPAO Tc99m SPECT scanning is indicative of Lewy body dementia. Involvement of the occipital cortex, which is typically spared in Alzheimers disease, sets the two apart from one another on PET studies. The cingulate island sign has also been ascribed to Lewy body dementia, where there is preservation of metabolism in the  mid-posterior cingulate gyrus. If present, this is said to be specific for Lewy body dementia.
  Alzheimer's disease
Neuronal loss with Alzheimer's disease occurs first in the mesial temporal lobe which can be seen as cerebral volume loss there on an MRI scan. To assess this region the scan should be viewed on a coronal sequence through the level of the pons, where the hippocampi can be seen clearly. Although medial temporal lobe atrophy is not remotely specific for Alzheimer's disease, it is almost always present. Early changes in metabolism can be seen in the posterior part of the cingulate gyrus and the precuneus on PET studies, as well as in the posterior temporal and parietal lobes.

13740,205212,A 55-year-old man with symptoms of breathlessness and palpitations is being investigated. He is found to be in AF. On examination he has a mid-diastolic murmur with presystolic accentuation. ECHO shows a solid pericardial mass. On MRI it is hyperintense to the myocardium on T1 and T2. What is the most likely diagnosis?,SBA: Cardiothoracic and vascular,Cardiac metastasis,Atrial myxoma,Atrial thrombus,Cardiac sarcoma,Papillary fibroelastoma,A,61%,16%,8%,8%,7%,"Explanation:
High T1 signal can be caused by:
Melanin, protein, contrast agents, fat, methaemaglobin (subacute haemorrhage).
  Cardiac metastases
Metastases are significantly more common than cardiac sarcomas, meaning metastases are the most common malignant cardiac tumours. In contrast to myxomas or fibroelastomas, malignant lesions tend to have a broad attachment to the heart wall. Tumours can be from lung or breast cancer, lymphoma, leukaemia and malignant melanoma.
Although malignant melanoma most commonly metastasizes to the lungs, liver, brain and skeleton and is rarely found in the heart, of cardiac metastases at all it is by far the most common.
  Atrial myxoma
These are the most common benign neoplasms of the heart. Although usually sporadic, they can occur as part of Carney complex (atrial myxoma, facial/buccal pigmentation, sertoli tumours of the testis and multiple other findings. Not to be confused with Carney triad - pulmonary chondromas, gastric leiomyosarcomas and extra-adrenal paragangliomas). The finding of a small mass attached to the interatrial septum by a stalk is classical. Their mobility allows some to prolapse through the relevant atrioventricular valve during the cardiac cycle. They can act as a focus for platelet aggregation leading to systemic emboli for the more common left sided masses or pulmonary emboli for right sided myxomas. Iso or hypointentisty on T1w MRI is typical.
  Carney Triad Carney Complex
1. Pulmonary chondromas Atrial myxoma
2. Gastric leiomyosarcoma Facial/ buccal pigmentation
3. Extra-adrenal paraganglioma Sertoli tumour of the testis
  Pituitary adenoma
  Papillary fibroelastoma
These tumours are rare even for cardiac tumours but yet are the most common cardiac tumour to be associated with the valves. Rather counter-intuitively, they do not cause valvular dysfunction. They are, like myxomas, relatively mobile, attached by a stalk, and able to prolapse through a valve but where myxomas usually arise from the interatrial septum, papillary fibroelastomas grow from the valve itself. Histopathologically they are gelatinous tumours resembling sea anemones with multiple papillary projections. They can act as a focus for platelet aggregation leading to systemic emboli for left sided masses or pulmonary emboli for right-sided masses.
  Cardiac sarcoma
There are many different types of cardiac sarcoma. Cardiac sarcomas are the most common cause of primary malignant cardiac tumours. Their presentation usually relates either to embolic phenomena such as TIAs or symptoms from invasion such as pericardial effusion. In contrast to myxomas or fibroelastomas, malignant lesions tend to have a broad attachment to the heart wall. Another useful differentiating feature on imaging is the involvement of more than one chamber of the heart.
  Atrial thrombus
The usual site for an atrial thrombus would be the left atrial appendage. Thrombi are not seen as mobile masses but as irregular lobulated masses. They can have a laminated appearance and the classical feature is low signal on gradient-echo MRI sequences owing to the presence of haemosiderin (blooming artefact). Ventricular thrombi can form too, it is usually a sequelae of a previous myocardial infarction which has healed leaving a hypomobile portion of the ventricular wall. Adjacent to that part of wall there is relative stasis sufficient to facilitate thrombus formation.",False,Atrial myxoma is the most likely diagnosis in this case because it is the most common primary cardiac tumor and is usually associated with a mid-diastolic murmur with presystolic accentuation.

The anatomy of the middle ear is complex but important and contains a number of specific anatomical terms.
  Image Â© Medical Exam Prep
  The epitympanum, also known as the attic, is the superior portion above the highest point of the tympanic membrane. It contains the head of the malleus and the short crus of the incus (These give the appearance of an ice-cream cone on an axial CT).
  Image Â© Medical Exam Prep
  The Prussak space is found within the epitympanum and is a tiny space at the top of the tympanic membrane, just behind the scutum. Its clinical relevance is that it is the usual origin for pars flaccida cholesteatomas.
The aditus ad antrum connects the epitympanum to the mastoid antrum and thence the mastoid air cells.
The tegmen mastoidium (tegmen means roof) is the point at which the mastoid air cells meet the temporal lobe of the brain.
The tegmen tympani is the point at which the upper most extent of the epitympanum reaches the temporal lobe of the brain.
    Image Â© Medical Exam Prep
  The mesotympanum is the space posterior to the tympanic membrane and contains the body of the incus, the manubrium (connected to the tympanic membrane) and the anterior process of the malleus and the stapes. The stapes is connected to the incus as well as the oval window of the cochlea. There is also a round window placed more inferiorly which bulges to allow compression waves transmitted from the stapes to the oval window to travel through the cochlea.

The biliary tract, or biliary tree, is a pathway through which bile that has been secreted by the liver is transported to the duodenum.
The biliary tract begins as the interlobular bile ducts form the right and left hepatic ducts. These two ducts merge to form the common hepatic duct, which is situated alongside the hepatic vein.
The common hepatic duct exits the liver and joins with the cystic duct from the gallbladder to form the common bile duct. The common bile duct is sometimes referred to as the âtrunk of the biliary treeâ and together with the hepatic artery and hepatic portal vein forms the central axis of the portal triad.
The common bile duct passes downwards posteriorly to the proximal duodenum and joins with the pancreatic duct from the pancreas to form the ampulla of Vater.

A Meckelâs diverticulum is a vestigial remnant of the vitellointestinal duct. It is the commonest malformation of the gastrointestinal tract, being present in around 2% of the population. They are twice as common in men than women.
When present a Meckelâs diverticulum is located in the distal ileum, usually within 60-100 cm (2 feet) of the ileocaecal valve. They are usually 3-6 cm (approx. 2 inches) long and may have a greater lumen than that of the ileum.
They are commonly found as an incidental finding, particularly at appendicectomy. The majority are asymptomaticbut they can present with the following complications:
Haemorrhage (25-50% of complications)
Intestinal obstruction (10-40% of complications)
Diverticulitis
Perforation
  Meckelâs diverticula run antimesenterically but receive their blood supply from the mesentery of the ileum, and a typical feeding vessel called the vitelline artery can be identified. They are typically lined with ileal mucosa but frequently contain ectopic mucosa, the two commonest types being gastric (50%) and pancreatic (5%). More rarely colonic or jejunal mucosa may be present.

On examination there is restricted range of movement in all directions. She is referred to an orthopaedic surgeon who requests an MRI scan.

What is the most likely diagnosis?,SBA: Musculoskeletal and Trauma,Syringomyelia,Diabetes Mellitus,Milwaukee shoulder,Multiple sclerosis,Hansen disease,A,37%,4%,51%,1%,7%,"Explanation:
Charcot joint (also known as neuropathic osteoarthropathy)
More commonly this condition is seen in the forefoot or ankle joints in patients with advanced diabetes mellitus. Although only a small number of Charcot joints affect the shoulder most of those caused by a syrinx do. A syrinx is also a more common cause of Charcot joints than either multiple sclerosis or Hansen disease (leprosy).
  Causes of Charcot joints
Diabetes mellitus
Syringomyelia
Hansen disease (Leprosy)
Poliomyelitis
Neurosyphilis
Multiple sclerosis
  Whatever the underlying cause, compromise to the sensory nerves supplying the relevant joint prevent the normal protective mechanisms and as such minor trauma does not have sufficient an environment to heal correctly. This is particularly pertinent to weight-bearing joints. Loss of sympathetic control of the same area is also thought to play a part.
The joints can take either an atrophic pattern, a heterotropic pattern or a mixed pattern.
The radiological findings can be summarised as the 5Ds, namely:
Destruction
Dislocation
Density (due to heterotrophic new bone formation and sclerosis)
Disorganisation
Debris
Characteristically there is no juxtaarticular osteoporosis but joint effusions are common. In the case of the shoulder, the humeral head may be completely destroyed.
  Atrophic
Heterotrophic
More common
Less common
Destruction predominates
Fragmentation and debris formation predominates

12871,205212,You are performing an FNA for a 76-year-old lady with an enlarged inguinal lymph node. The histology is reported as squamous cell carcinoma. Which of the following is the LEAST likely primary source?,"SBA: Genito urinary, Adrenal, Obstetrics & Gynaecology and Breast",Bladder cancer,Vulval cancer,Vaginal cancer,Cervical cancer,Anal cancer,A,71%,5%,3%,13%,7%,"Explanation:
Although around 10% of bladder cancers are squamous cell in nature, involvement of the inguinal nodes is considered non-regional disease. Bladder cancer normally spreads first to the internal and external iliac nodes.
  Women
Cervical cancer is predominantly squamous cell in origin and spreads initially via the obturator nodes and thence to the internal or external iliac nodes. The lymphatic spread of vaginal cancer depends to an extent on its exact location. Cancers situated in the upper two thirds of the vagina behaves in a similar way to cervical cancer (Obturater, internal and external iliac nodes) but those in the lower third do spread first to the inguinal or femoral nodes as local disease as do vulval cancers.
  Men
Penile cancer is well known to spread to the inguinal lymph nodes as regional disease and indeed at the time of presentation most patients (>90%) will have palpable nodes here. By contrast anal cancer spreads first to the perirectal nodes and then to the inguinal nodes, although both are considered as regional disease. One point of controversy would be that anal cancers are actually far more prevalent than penile cancers so although the latter may be more likely to be found in inguinal nodes as an index presentation, arguably the former is a more likely diagnosis by sheer volume of numbers.
Scrotal skin cancers are usually squamous cell in origin and spread via the lymphatics, initially to the inguinal nodes. Of note involvement of the inguinal nodes may be contralateral to the site of the index tumour since both sets of inguinal nodes drain the whole scrotal sac. Testicular tumours however, will only spread to the inguinal region as regional disease if the patient has undergone previous inguinal or scrotal surgery. In the absence of prior intervention the inguinal region is considered as a non-regional area for testicular tumours.
  Proportion of squamous cell carcinomas
Penile cancer
  >90%
Anal cancer
Scrotal skin cancer
Cervical cancer
Vulval cancer
Vaginal cancer
>80%
Bladder cancer
<10%
Prostate cancer
<1%
Testicular cancer
<1% (can be a site of metastatic SCC though)
  Prostate cancer is nearly always adenocarcinoma not squamous cell carcinoma and secondly regional nodes in the context of prostate cancer would be internal and external iliac nodes. Inguinal nodes are therefore less likely to be from prostate cancer; these would be considered as non-regional metastatic disease.
When not adenocarcinomatous in origin, prostate cancer can (rarely) be transitional cell, sarcoma, lymphoma or adenoid cystic cancer.
Inguinal lymph node involvement would be considered regional disease for anal cancers in both sexes as well as penile and scrotal skin cancers in men and vulval or vaginal cancers in women.
  Bladder cancer
Imaging the bladder with MRI is a balancing act between sufficient distension to achieve adequate sensitivity rates without the images being compromised by motion due to the discomfort of having a full bladder for the duration of the scan.
On T2 the detrusor muscle returns low signal but the continuity of this layer will be disrupted if there is invasion.
The T1 images are more useful for evaluating lymph node involvement and any bony metastases.
Post-contrast images are of limited use in bladder cancer imaging. Some literature does support their use since the tumours tend to enhance early, whereas the muscle layer undergoes only delayed enhancement but since the bladder mucosa and submucosa also enhance in the early phase the appearances can be confusing to the untrained eye.",False,"I chose 4.

Aspiration
This classically causes lower lobar bronchiectasis. Many different factors in childhood can cause an increased risk of aspiration. Of course, no two patients with cerebral palsy are alike and the information in the question is purposefully brief, however cerebral palsy which affects swallowing coordination or central tone can indeed put the patient at risk of aspirating.
  Cystic Fibrosis
This is causes bronchiectasis but predominantly affects the upper lobes. Presentation, if not before this point, is with recurrent chest infections. Otherwise it can present in the neonatal period with a meconium plug. Adults often suffer from subfertility, pancreatitis and malabsorption.
  Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia
This predominantly causes bronchiectasis in the middle and lower lobes. Only 50% have Kartagenerâs syndrome (A triad of situs inversus, sinusitis and bronchiectasis), hence the normal heart position in the question. Affected men are infertile, and women are subfertile.
  ABPA
This is generally only seen in asthmatics and is characterised by central bronchiectasis particularly in the mid-zones and sometimes upper zones. Centrilobular nodules are also a feature.

Chronic atelectasis arises secondary to airway obstruction from any one of a multitude of different causes (some benign, some malignant) and associated bronchiectasis can develop.

Thymoma
The right cardiophrenic angle is not a particularly classical location for a thymoma, by any stretch of the imagination. It would not be impossible however and with the correct demographic, as well as symptoms of diplopia pointing towards a diagnosis of myasthenia gravis this is the most likely answer given here.
A pericardial fat pad would be of negative Hounsfield units.
Both pericardial and bronchogenic cysts could easily be 20HU however neither fit with the symptom of diplopia.
Lymphomas can be seen as a solitary lobulated mediastinal mass arising from thymic tissue in children but this is the wrong age group and would not be a classical presentation for lymphoma.
  The thymus is a specialized primary lymphoid organ of the immune system, within which T-lymphocytes mature. After puberty it decreases in size and is slowly replaced by fat.
It is mainly located within the superior mediastinum, posterior to the manubrium sterni. A certain degree of anatomical variation exists and in some individuals it can extend superiorly into the neck, or inferiorly into the anterior mediastinum.
The thymus has an asymmetrical, flat shape with a lobular structure. The lobules are comprised of a series of follicles, which consist of a medullary and a cortical portion.
The cortex is located peripherally within each follicle and is mainly composed of lymphocytes, supported by a network of finely branched epithelial reticular cells.
The medulla is located centrally within each follicle and contains fewer lymphocytes and a greater number of epithelial reticular cells. It also contains Hassallâs corpuscles, which are the remains of the epithelial tubes.",True,"Thymoma is the most likely diagnosis in this case because it is the most common type of tumor found in the cardiophrenic angle.

14216,205212,A baby boy born at full term is started on phototherapy for presumed physiological jaundice at day 3. Two days later his condition has improved and he is discharged home. On day 16 he is re-referred by the Health Visitor with ongoing jaundice. An ultrasound scan is normal and a HIDA scan shows no bowel excretion after 6 hours. Which of the following would help differentiate between neonatal hepatitis and biliary atresia? Select ONE answer only.,SBA: Paediatrics,Liver biopsy,Time of presentation,Negative viral serology,No excretion on a HIDA scan at 6 hours,Normal ultrasound scan,A,59%,3%,3%,28%,7%,"Explanation:
The differential diagnosis here is between biliary atresia and neonatal hepatitis. After 6 hours and 24 hours the former should show no bowel uptake on a HIDA scan since the unformed biliary ducts do not produce the bile to excrete to the bowel which would normally give rise to the tracer uptake there. In contrast, patients with neonatal hepatitis have an anatomically normal liver and so produce small amounts of bile, even if the overall liver function is severely derranged. Thus if there is any bowel activity at 24 hours biliary atresia can be excluded. If there is bowel activity at 6 hours then biliary atresia can also be excluded in a far shorter timeframe. Ideally if there is no bowel activity at 6 hours then the patient should be brought back for further images at 24 hours. Strictly speaking this does not constitute a 'repeat' HIDA scan since no further tracer injection has been given. Unfortunately the option of 'continue the HIDA scan to 24 hours' has not been provided. Certainly if there is no bowel uptake after 24 hours then a biopsy should be done to exclude hepatitis and confirm biliary atresia as the diagnosis. Accurate diagnosis of biliary atresia is crucial since a portojejunostomy (Kasai procedure) performed early (around 1-2 months of age) is associated with higher success rates with the native liver.
  Biliary atresia
This presents between two weeks and two months of life as an obstructive jaundice picture (i.e. conjugated hyperbilirubinaemia). The extrahepatic bile ducts have become fibrosed and cause obstruction. Initial investigation is usually with ultrasound and an echogenic âtriangular cordâ structure in the porta hepatitis is considered pathognomic. The gallbladder may be normal, small or non-visualised and therefore contributes little to the diagnosis. Further investigation is often with a HIDA scan. If there normal activity within the liver (usually after only a few minutes) but there is no visualisation of tracer within the bowel after 24 hours this is considered diagnostic. Phenobarbitol can be given in the days leading up to the scan to increase biliary output.
  Neonatal hepatitis
This usually presents within the first month of life with jaundice. After blood tests, ultrasound is the first line of investigation and may show global increased echogenicity, or may be considered to be normal. A HIDA scan should show some bowel uptake (indicating a slowly functioning biliary system with biliary excretion into the bowel) though this may take the full 24 hours to be visualised. Neonatal hepatitis may be caused by hepatitis viruses, but also CMV, HSV, and toxoplasmosis. Non-viral causes include alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency, and inborn errors of metabolism.",False,"I chose number 4 because a HIDA scan at 6 hours can help to differentiate between neonatal hepatitis and biliary atresia. In cases of biliary atresia, there will be no excretion of the radiotracer after 6 hours, whereas in cases of neonatal hepatitis, there will be some excretion. Therefore, a negative HIDA scan at 6 hours can help to confirm a diagnosis of biliary atresia.",1,"3. A question about clinical reasoning, what would help differentiate between two diagnoses?

Osteoid osteoma
These are small benign tumours but which can be quite symptomatic, classically with pain relieved by aspirin. The majority form in the diaphyses of long bones but the posterior elements of the spine is another classic location.
The radiolucent nidus and symptoms of night pain in a young patient point to either an osteoid osteoma or an osteoblastoma. The final diagnosis comes down to size. <1.5cm is definitely an osteoid osteoma, and >2 cm is definitely an osteoblastoma. There is a nasty grey area somewhere between the two sizes.
On x-ray the radiolucent nidus may not be fully appreciated and the abnormality which is picked up will be the consequential sclerotic solid periosteal reaction. In the spine there may be a painful scoliosis concave towards the lesion as a result of adjacent muscular spasm.

Non-accidental injury
It is the responsibility of all members of the healthcare profession to be alert to the possibility of non-accidental injury. For radiologists, there are specific findings which should alert the reporter to the possibility of non-accidental injury. These include:
Lower limb injuries in a non-ambulant child
Discrepancy between the history and apparent injuries
Delay seeking medical attention
Metaphyseal fractures (corner or bucket-handle)
Multiple fractures of different ages
Scapula fractures
Posterior rib fractures
Sternal fractures
Skull fractures (especially non-parietal, or crossing sutures)
  It is important to appreciate that any fracture (not just the ones listed above) can be caused by non-accidental injury.
A skeletal survey to investigate for the presence of further fractures includes:
Two views of the skull (frontal and lateral)
AP of upper limbs (over multiple films if necessary)
DP of wrist/hand
Lateral of elbow and wrist
AP of lower limbs (over multiple films if necessary)
DP feet
AP ankle
Lateral of ankle and knee
AP abdomen and pelvis
Three views of the chest (frontal and two oblique)
Lateral whole spine
CT head - if younger than 1 year, or older than 1 year with head trauma or abnormal neurology, or older than 2
  Siblings younger than age 2 should also have the same imaging as the index patient.
The imaging should be performed and reported in 24 hours. (No later than 72 hours as an absolute maximum).
The imaging should be taken by two experienced radiographers who are level 3 certified for safeguarding of children.
The imaging should also be performed in the presence of a registered paediatric nurse to support both the parents and the child involved.
The images should be reported by two separate radiologists both of whom have subspecialist paediatric experience.",False,"I chose this answer because it is important for two general radiologists to report the images in order to ensure accuracy and to detect any possible signs of non-accidental injury.

12146,205212,A 32-year-old lady with pre-eclampsia who delivered 2 days ago by normal vaginal delivery develops sudden cortical blindness. She has been receiving treatment for pre-eclampsia both before and after delivery. She is taken for a scan. What are the expected imaging features?,SBA: Central Nervous and Head & Neck,Pituitary haemorrhage and ischaemic changes to both occipital lobes,Low attenuation and loss of grey/white matter differentiation in both occipital lobes,Enlarged pituitary with high T1 and low T2 signal,Subarachnoid haemorrhage,Normal CT head,A,30%,55%,11%,2%,3%,"Explanation:
This is not a straightforward question; the answers given in this question are deliberately confusing but this question is ultimately aimed at PRES (posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome). Although the pathophysiology of PRES is not fully understood, in imaging terms it is specifically the subcortical white matter which is involved and shows ischemic changes (low attenuation on CT and high T2/FLAIR on MRI). Loss of grey/white matter differentiation implies territorial infarction with cytotoxic oedema as opposed to the vasogenic (and reversible) oedema of PRES where the grey/white matter junction is preserved. Given this, we can choose the answer given over the other option mentioning the occipital lobes despite the red herring of the pituitary haemorrhage. Pituitary haemorrhage in a post-partum setting points to Sheehan syndrome but around 10% of patients with PRES also have intraparenchymal haemorrhage.
Classically PRES presents as a visual disturbance in a pregnant or post-partum patient with pre-eclampsia and CT shows haemorrhages in the posterior fossa. The main underlying pathological process is vasogenic oedema. Technically PRES is not exclusive to pregnancy or the post-partum period, and often with a history (implied or provided) of pre-eclampsia. Other causes such as SLE or immunosuppression are also technically feasible. Cortical blindness is the classical symptom.
Sheehan syndrome is pituitary apoplexy due to hypovolaemic shock and can be consequential to delivery. At the time of apoplexy, the predominant issue for the patient is the systemic hypovolaemia for which aggressive management is usually already being pursued. In the early days following the delivery, the first hypopituitary issues to manifest is usually any or all of hyponatraemia, diabetes insipidus or hypothyroidism. At this time the MRI findings can vary from a normal appearing pituitary through to the classic pituitary apoplexy appearances of an enlarged pituitary with high T1 signal. Patients can also present many months or years later with panhypoituitarism at which time an MRI will usually show an empty sella.
 ",True,"The correct answer is 3 and 4. Pituitary haemorrhage and ischaemic changes to both occipital lobes are expected imaging features in a patient with sudden cortical blindness. Pituitary haemorrhage is a common complication of pre-eclampsia, and ischaemic changes to the occipital lobes can occur due to reduced blood flow to the area due to the pre-eclampsia. Subarachnoid haemorrhage is not expected in this case, and a normal CT head would not be expected either.",3,"3. A question about the management of a patient, what is the most appropriate treatment?

14584,205212,You are reviewing a cardiac MRI scan which shows a 9mm mass in the left ventricle. It is attached to the left coronary cusp by a stalk and returns intermediate signal on the T1 weighted sequence. What is the most likely diagnosis? Select ONE answer only.,SBA: Cardiothoracic and vascular,Papillary fibroelastoma,Cardiac metastasis,Cardiac sarcoma,Atrial thrombus,Atrial myxoma,A,75%,2%,2%,2%,19%,"Explanation:
Papillary fibroelastoma
These tumours are rare even for cardiac tumours but yet are the most common cardiac tumour to be associated with the valves. Rather counter-intuitively, they do not cause valvular dysfunction. They are usually quite small and, like myxomas, relatively mobile, attached by a stalk, and able to prolapse through a valve but where myxomas usually arise from the interatrial septum, papillary fibroelastomas grow from the valve itself. Histopathologically they are gelatinous tumours resembling sea anemones with multiple papillary projections. They can act as a focus for platelet aggregation leading to systemic emboli for left sided masses or pulmonary emboli for right sided masses. On MRI they are often low in signal on T2 weighted sequences owing to their fibrous nature.
  Atrial thrombus
The usual site for an atrial thrombus would be the left atrial appendage. Thrombi are not seen as mobile masses but as irregular lobulated masses. They can have a laminated appearance and the classical feature is low signal on gradient-echo MRI sequences owing to the presence of haemosiderin (blooming artefact). They do not enhance. Ventricular thrombi can form too, it is usually a sequela of a previous myocardial infarction which has healed leaving a hypomobile portion of the ventricular wall. Adjacent to that part of wall there is relative stasis sufficient to facilitate thrombus formation.
  Atrial myxoma
These are the most common benign neoplasms of the heart. Although usually sporadic, they can occur as part of Carney syndrome (atrial myxoma, facial/buccal pigmentation, sertoli tumours of the testis and multiple other findings. Not to be confused with Carney triad - pulmonary hamartomas, gastric leiomyosarcomas and extra-adrenal paragangliomas). The finding of a small mass attached to the interatrial septum by a stalk is classical. Their mobility allows some to prolapse through the relevant atrioventricular valve during the cardiac cycle. They can act as a focus for platelet aggregation leading to systemic emboli for the more common left sided masses or pulmonary emboli for right sided myxomas. Iso or hypointensity on T1w MRI is typical.
  Carney Triad Carney Syndrome
1. Pulmonary harmatoma Atrial myxoma
2. Gastric leiomyosarcoma (GIST) Facial/ buccal pigmentation
3. Extra-adrenal paraganglioma
Sertoli tumour of the testis
Pituitary adenoma
    Cardiac sarcoma
There are many different types of cardiac sarcoma. Cardiac sarcomas are the most common cause of primary malignant cardiac tumours. Their presentation usually relates either to embolic phenomena such as TIAs or symptoms from invasion such as pericardial effusion. In contrast to myxomas or fibroelastomas, malignant lesions tend to have a broad attachment to the heart wall. Another useful differentiating feature on imaging is the involvement of more than one chamber of the heart.
  Cardiac metastases
Metastases are significantly more common than cardiac sarcomas meaning metastases are the most common malignant cardiac tumours. In contrast to myxomas or fibroelastomas, malignant lesions tend to have a broad attachment to the heart wall. Tumours can be from lung or breast cancer, lymphoma, leukaemia and malignant melanoma.",False,"Atrial myxoma is the most likely diagnosis because it is the most common primary cardiac tumor, and it typically presents as an intracardiac mass attached to the left coronary cusp by a stalk and returns intermediate signal on the T1 weighted sequence.

The baby was born at term by normal vaginal delivery and has been doing well since birth. What should you expect to find on the ultrasound scan? Select ONE answer only.,SBA: Paediatrics,"Nothing, normal finding",Haematometrocolpos,Bilateral cerebriform adrenal glands,Unilateral adrenal neoplasm,Ovarian neoplasm,A,88%,7%,3%,1%,1%,"Explanation:
Vaginal bleeding in neonatal girls is a common phenomenon and simply represents the response of the normal uterine endometrium to the withdrawal from (maternal) oestrogens once the baby is born. It occurs within the first few days of birth and should last less than a week. No further investigation is necessary, and any abnormality found on ultrasound is an incidental finding.
  Mullerian duct anomalies (MDA)
The two Mullerian ducts form separately then fuse in the first trimester to form all the structures between the upper vagina and the fallopian tubes. The final part of the amalgamation of the two sides is resorption of the central uterine septum.  There are various classification systems the scope of which is subspecialist.
  Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH)
Normal-appearing adrenal glands does not exclude a diagnosis of CAH however usually the classical appearance for the adrenal glands in a case of CAH is of diffuse enlargement with a so-called 'wrinkled' morphology. The word 'cerebriform' is often used to describe them and compares their appearance to that of the brain. The usual hypoechoic cortex and hyperechoic medulla is still seen but the enlarged gland is folded upon itself giving the wrinkled appearance. The role of ultrasound is also to discern any normal male or female anatomy. The normal uterus can usually be identified, if present, but the ovaries may simply be too small at birth to appreciate. In contrast, the normal testes, where present, should be visible with ultrasound from birth. Females usually present with ambiguous genitalia whereas males can present later with severe electrolyte imbalances.",True,"The ultrasound scan should show nothing, as normal findings, since the baby was born at term by normal vaginal delivery and has been doing well since birth. The frank blood in the nappy is likely due to normal physiological processes, such as the passage of meconium or the shedding of the umbilical stump. Therefore, the ultrasound scan should not reveal any abnormalities.",2,"3. A question about patient management, what is the best course of action?

10506,205212,A 56-year-old man with an enlarged prostate and a mildly elevated PSA undergoes a nuclear medicine bone scan which shows significant uptake in the lungs. He has a normal calcium and phosphate. His CXR shows tiny diffuse calcific densities. What is the most likely explanation?,SBA: Cardiothoracic and vascular,Alveolar microlithiasis,Secondary hyperparathyroidism,Tertiary hyperparathyroidism,Primary hyperparathyroidism,Silicosis,A,75%,7%,5%,1%,12%,"Explanation:
Alveolar microlithiasis
This condition falls under the 'common presentation of uncommon conditions' category. The patient develops tiny calculi in the alveoli during middle age. Typically the serum calcium and phosphate are normal and if the patient undergoes a nuclear medicine bone scan there is impressively high uptake diffusely in the lungs. Despite this the patient is often remarkably well.
  Hyperparathyroidism
Parathyroid hormone acts to increase calcium levels either by promoting reabsorption in the kidneys or by acting on the osteoclasts of the bones and leads to increased bone resorption. This is seen as generalised osteopenia and cortical thinning, particularly of the subperiosteal bone.
Primary hyperparathyroidism is usually caused by an autonomous adenoma (alternatively parathyroid hyperplasia or a parathyroid carcinoma). Medullary nephrocalcinosis is most commonly caused by primary hyperparathyroidism but does also occur with secondary and tertiary hyperparathyroidism.
Secondary hyperparathyroidism is a hyperplastic response of the parathyroid glands to the high phosphate and low calcium levels which accompany renal osteodystrophy. Soft tissue calcification is very much a feature of renal osteodystrophy. Confusingly the high circulating levels of phosphate in renal osteodystrophy leads to dystrophic mineralisation of trabecular bone which is seen as sclerosis; hence renal osteodystrophy is a cause of generalised increase in bone density despite hyperparathyroidism being a cause of osteopenia.
Tertiary hyperparathyroidism occurs when a patient with secondary hyperparathyroidism (ie chronic overstimulation of the parathyroid glands) goes on to develop an autonomous adenoma.
  Silicosis
Inhalation of silica leads to fibrosis. It is an occupational hazard associated with working in mines, quarries or with glass and ceramics. Chronic silicosis occurs following exposure over 10-20 years. Small nodules measuring a few millimeters in diameter form with an upper zone distribution (involvement of the upper zones is classical for inhalational diseases). Around 10% of these nodules calcify and this can be seen on imaging as multiple small foci of calcification in the upper zones. Lymph node enlargement is also a feature with eggshell calcification often quoted as a dominant feature of silicosis despite only being present in around 5% of patients. Intralobular septal thickening is often seen but pleural involvement is not a feature of silicosis.",False,"Primary hyperparathyroidism is the most likely explanation for the patient's symptoms because it is characterized by an elevated PSA, enlarged prostate, and calcific densities in the lungs.

This question is a little sparse on detail.
In theory SLE could present as seizures subsequent to cerebral abscess formation. On the whole, vascular events are more common, but less likely to present as seizures. The brain parenchyma is not often involved in SLE however the exception is haemorrhage or abscess formation. (Neuropsychiatric symptoms do occur.). There is a rare entity called Libman-Sacks endocarditis where sterile vegetations grow on the cardiac valves. Some sources say that these can be the focus for subsequent septic cerebral emboli.
  Wegener granulomatosis
Wegener granulomatosis has recently been re-christened as âgranulomatosis with polyangiitisâ. It can affect the CNS in a variety of ways. Granulomatous lesions, vasculitis causing small infarctions, and haemorrhage are all features. Classically the patient will have a âsaddleâ nose due to collapse of the nasal septum and cartilaginous nasal bridge.
  Behcet syndrome
Behcet syndrome is classically described as a triad of oral and genital ulcers associated with one of several ocular manifestations. Its effect on the CNS tends to be as meningoencephalitis or venous sinus thrombosis. In theory either could present with seizures but it would be a stretch to describe oral ulcers as a facial rash.

10856,205212,What is the most common cause of an incidental hyperlucent left lung on a PA chest radiograph of a 30-year-old woman? Select one answer only.,SBA: Cardiothoracic and vascular,Rotation to the left,Rotation to the right,Poland syndrome,Swyer-James syndrome,Alpha-1-antitrypsin,A,56%,32%,6%,5%,1%,"Explanation:
Film rotation
Unfortunately it is more likely that technical features will cause unilateral hyperlucency than any of the pathological conditions which may feature in the differential diagnosis. Rotation of the patient to the left on a PA film will bring the left hemithorax away from the plate. The chest anatomy is such that in doing so the xray beam travels through less lung tissue in terms of depth than either the contralateral side in the same rotated patient or the left lung in an unrotated patient. The beam travelling through less lung tissue is therefore less attenuated and the lung appears hyperlucent on the resultant film
  Poland syndrome
Poland syndrome is a rare cause of a hyperlucent hemithorax on a CXR. There is hypoplasia or even aplasia of the chest wall musculature plus/minus breast. Abnormalities of the fingers on the same side such as syndactyly (fusion) or brachydactyly (shortening) can also occur and the ipsilateral ribs may also be abnormal.
  Swyer-James syndrome
In this condition, normal development of the infant lung is impeded by bronchiolitis (viral or mycoplasma) at an early age, with superadded acute airspace destruction. Consequently the affected lobe is small and lucent on the CXR due to air trapping. It is a differential diagnosis for a unilateral lucent hemithorax, along with a pneumothorax, very large pulmonary emboli and causes of decreased chest wall musculature such as Poland syndrome or, historically, polio. In an an exam situation Swyer-James syndrome is usually given as a teenage or young adult patient with a history of recurrent LRTIs. Air trapping, and bronchiectasis can also be described.
  Alpha 1 antitrypsin deficiency
Alpha-1 antitrypsin is a glycoprotein which is made in the liver and secreted. One of its functions in the lungs is to oppose the action of proteolytic enzymes the likes of which are secreted by white blood cells in order to counter sub-clinical bacterial infections. Since A1AT is deficient in these patients the unopposed action of the enzymes goes beyond the intended destruction of pathogenic bacteria and causes damage to the lung tissue. Patients are usually diagnosed in early adulthood when their symptoms develop. On CT there is panacinar emphysema, particularly affecting the bases. Bronchiectasis is also often seen. Cirrhosis is another feature of this disease and should be looked for on imaging. ",True,"I chose 5. Rotation to the left because it is the most common cause of an incidental hyperlucent left lung on a PA chest radiograph of a 30-year-old woman.

11836,205212,A 15-year-old boy falls at home and suffers a wrist fracture. While he is having a cast applied his parents discuss their concerns with an A&E doctor. The patient has just returned from a gap year abroad. His parents become increasingly concerned that their son has changed. He is no longer interested in visiting his friends and sits for hours at home doing nothing. They have also noticed a tremor to his hands and some slurring of his speech. His x-ray shows generalised osteoporotic changes and a few small subarticular cysts. The triangular fibrocartilage complex appears to contain some calcification. What is the most likely diagnosis?,SBA: Paediatrics,Wilson disease,Haemochromatosis,Calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease,Enteropathic arthropathy,Alkaptonuria,A,70%,10%,10%,2%,7%,"Explanation:
Wilson disease
Inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion, this disease results from an excess of copper within the body due to the inability of the liver to excrete it. It can present in childhood with cirrhosis but later presentations are more likely to be due to the neuropsychiatric manifestations. Clinically adolescent or adult patients develop tremor and dysarthria due to copper deposition in the lentiform nucleus. The classic diagnostic feature is Kayser-Fleischer pigment rings in the eyes. Radiologically the following features can be seen:
Hepatic manifestations: The liver appears normal on MRI since fatty infiltration effectively cancels out the paramagnetic effects of copper
Musculoskeletal manifestations: Generalised osteoporosis, subarticular cysts, chondrocalcinosis and arthropathy which can mimic CPPD
CNS manifestations: White matter atrophy and T2 hyperintensities predominantly affecting the basal ganglia and thalami. T1 signal is also high in these areas, differentiating it from many of the other basal ganglia disorders. There is a classical feature of âsparing of the red nucleusâ leading to an appearance known as the giant panda sign at the level of the pons.
  Alkaptonuria also known as ochronosis
This condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. It is caused by excessive circulating levels of homogentisic acid (HGA) when the enzyme which would usually degrade it is deficient. HGA has an affinity for collagen and accumulates in the connective tissues throughout the body. In visible light HGA has a blackish colour and thus the disease can be diagnosed in infancy when a babyâs nappies are stained black by the presence of HGA in the urine. By the time patients reach their 20s pigmentation may be visible in their skin, particularly the ears. This is initially a dark yellow colour (hence the term ochronosis, from âOchreâ in Greek meaning a dark yellow colour) but can progress to blue-grey and black.
In imaging chondrocalcinosis is the most prominent feature, with calcification and destruction of the intervertebral discs. Premature osteoarthritic changes to the hands, feet, shoulders, hips and knees will also develop as the collagen deteriorates. Deposition in the heart and kidneys too leads to cardiac and renal failure.
  Haemochromatosis
The primary version of this disease can be inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion. Excess dietary iron is absorbed and this accumulates in all tissues of the body leading to various different problems.
Secondary haemochromatosis can arise if patients receive numerous blood transfusions without sufficient chelation to mitigate against the iron overload.
Cirrhosis â the presence of the excess iron in the liver leads to unusual signal properties on an MRI scan. Iron is paramagnetic and causes spin dephasing. T2* and T2 sequences are particularly vulnerable to this effect but lower than expected signal will be seen on all sequences. Importantly the signal from the spleen and bone marrow should be normal. By contrast they will be involved in cases of transfusional siderosis.
Generalised osteoporosis
Hook like osteophytes on the radial aspect of the metacarpal heads â these are highly characteristic
Chondrocalcinosis, particularly affecting the knees
Insulin dependent diabetes
Congestive cardiomyopathy
Skin pigmentation
  Calcium pyrophosphate dehydrate disease (CPPD) also known as pseudogout
CPPD can present in an acute or subacute fashion but is also seen as a chronic cause of joint inflammation. It may be misdiagnosed as simple osteoarthritis owing to its often bilateral and symmetrical distribution but there are also a couple of areas of the body which can be affected in particular, and which would be unusual for isolated degenerative changes.
The patellofemoral joint â joint space loss here can be extremely striking with almost complete preservation of the joint space at the medial and lateral compartments of the knee
Triangular fibrocartilaginous complex of the wrist â calcification
Radiocarpal joints â degenerative changes without involvement of the DIPs and PIPs
  Enteropathic arthropathy
Sacroiliitis and spondylitis are the hallmarks of enteropathic arthropathy. It is an important seronegative spondyloarthropathy. Outside of the axial skeleton, other features common to all seronegative spondyloarthropathies are also found. These include arthritis in the hands and feet, uveitis, and enthesitis (especially calcaneal). Interestingly although it is most commonly discussed in relation to Crohnâs disease and ulcerative colitis, only 5 and 10% respectively of patients with these conditions will develop enteropathic arthropathy. By contrast of patients with Whipple disease, around 75-90% of them will suffer from enteropathic arthropathy. Infection with Salmonella, Shigella and Yersinia are also known associations.",False,"Calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease (CPPD) is the most likely diagnosis in this case. CPPD is a type of arthritis caused by the deposition of calcium pyrophosphate crystals in the joints and is often associated with osteoporosis.

Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease
There are three types of this prion transmitted disease; the one linked to the BSE (bovine spongiform encephalopathy) epidemic of the late 1980s and 1990s, a rare familial variant, and finally a sporadic version which accounts for the vast majority of the cases. Clinically there is a rapidly progressive dementia with ataxia and myoclonus which should be the give-away feature even before imaging features are discussed. On MRI, the reported finding is of high T2/FLAIR signal in the basal ganglia bilaterally and symmetrically (particularly the putamen). The pulvinar sign is often described in association with cJD which describes high FLAIR signal in the pulvinar thalamic nuclei (called the hockey stick sign). Strangely the signal changes are a rare cause of restriction of diffusion, seen as bright areas on DWI. Important negatives for this condition are the lack of enhancement with contrast and the lack of white matter involvement (since the white matter is protected by its myelin sheath).

      Huntington disease
There are relatively few radiological manifestations of Huntington disease. The usual one described is atrophy of the heads of the caudate nuclei with consequential prominence of the adjacent lateral ventricle frontal horns with a âboxâ like appearance. Various studies have been done to quantify the extent of this atrophy.
  Parkinson's disease
Generalised cerebral atrophy occurs with Parkinson's disease but is a highly non-specific feature. There are, however, radiological findings in the midbrain which although subtle, are far more specific. Parkinson's disease occurs when there is neuronal loss in the substantia nigra, specifically the pars compacta of the substantia nigra. On a T2 weighted MRI image this appears as blurring of the intermediate signal intensity line which separates the two adjacent low intensity structures (these are the pars reticulata of the substantia nigra and the red nucleus).
A DAT scan (Dopamine Active Transfer) can be performed to confirm the diagnosis. This uses the radiopharmaceutical I-123 Ioflupane to image dopamine transporters in the brain. These are present in the highest concentrations in the putamina and caudate nuclei. In patients with true Parkinson's disease (as opposed to other similar conditions), there will be loss of uptake in the posterior putamen. This can be an asymmetric finding. Colloquially speaking the appearance of a these areas on a normal patient resembles a comma and on a patient with Parkinson's disease they become more like full stops.

There has been a history of diarrhoea for three weeks but no blood in the stools. Some basic blood tests are performed which show raised inflammatory markers. An abdominal ultrasound does not show any abnormalities but an MRI of the childâs elbow reveals bony oedema and a partly septated elbow effusion.

Although hopefully a septic arthritis would be being considered from the outset, and the patient should be receiving antibiotics even prior to their MRI scan, the damage done to a joint by a purulent effusion is best avoided by washing the joint out. This will have a faster therapeutic effect than antibiotic therapy and is therefore the priority in this case. The diagnosis of a septic joint is confirmed by aspiration of purulent joint fluid. Septations within the effusion are a strong indicator of septic arthritis.
  Septic arthritis
Septic arthritis in any age group is a surgical emergency and the joint must be washed out as soon as feasible in order to avoid irreversible joint damage caused. Clinical suspicious must therefore be high, not least because early x-rays may be normal. Initial investigation should be with ultrasound and echogenic debris may be found within a joint effusion. The diagnosis is confirmed by aspiration of purulent joint fluid. The condition can also be readily appreciable on MRI which is very sensitive for early joint damage. Synovial oedema can be seen as high signal on T2 with enhancement post-gadolinium on T1 fat saturated sequences.

9056,205212,You are performing an ultrasound scan on a patient who has recently undergone an intraheptic portosystemic shunt via the transjugular route. Which of the following findings would alert you to the possibility of a shunt occlusion?,SBA: Gastrointestinal,Hepatofugal flow in the portal vein,Hepatopetal flow in the portal vein,Hepatopetal flow in the hepatic vein,Hepatofugal flow in the hepatic vein,Hepatopetal flow in the shunt,A,63%,14%,8%,7%,8%,"Explanation:
The words centripetal and centrifugal are derived from Newtonian physics to do with objects moving in a circular fashion. They come from Latin as follows:
    Centripetal = falling towards the centre
  Centrifugal = fleeing the centre
  Centri = centre
Petere = to fall                                                                     
Fugere = to flee (the word fugitive has the same origins)          
  When applied to hepatic circulation the words are taken to indicate the direction of flow within a given vessel, namely whether flow is into (hepatopetal) or out of (hepatofugal) the liver.  Thus, ordinarily the portal vein would be expected to demonstrate so-called hepatopetal flow and the hepatic vein hepatofugal flow. Flow within the shunt cannot reasonably be described as either but should be described according to the systems it is bridging. The shunt is there to relieve portal hypertension caused by cirrhosis and should thus be taking blood from the portal system and shunting it to the systemic system. Hepatofugal flow in the portal vein suggests that the shunt is occluded with blood from the portal vein reversing to flow via the splenic vein and any pre-existing collateral pathways to the systemic circulation.",False,"I chose number 4 because hepatofugal flow in the hepatic vein is an indication of a shunt occlusion. This is because when a shunt is occluded, the flow of blood is reversed, and instead of the normal hepatopetal flow of blood, there is a hepatofugal flow.

10461,205212,A 78-year-old lady has a new diagnosis of lung cancer. There is a 3cm mass lesion touching the right main bronchus in the right upper lobe. No chest wall invasion is seen but there is a second smaller lesion in the lingula. Enlarged lymph nodes are seen in the ipsilateral mediastinum only. There is no pleural effusion. Which of the following denotes the poorest prognosis?,SBA: Cardiothoracic and vascular,Satellite nodule in the lingula,Supraclavicular lymph nodes,Chest wall invasion,Invasion of the pericardium,Subcarinal lymph nodes,A,51%,18%,11%,20%,1%,"Explanation:
For this patient the presence of a satellite nodule in a contralateral lobe is considered as metastatic disease.
In an ideal world every trainee radiologist would have all the intricacies of staging for all tumour types committed to memory. A qualified subspecialist radiologist could reasonably be expected to be extremely familiar with the staging for cancers within their remit but for the majority of trainees it is simply not practical to memorise each and every staging scheme. As an overall strategy, the most important stages to understand are those which change the management for patients. Of note with lung cancer, at Stage IIIb the management changes significantly because stage IIIb and stage IV patients are unresectable. Another useful facet to lung cancer (TNM) staging is satellite nodules:
Same lobe = T3
Different lobe = T4
Contralateral lung = M1
For lung cancer some of the important staging features are as follows (IASLC 8th ed):
  T1 tumours are <3cm
N1 = ipsilateral hilar nodes
T2 tumours are 3-5cm but dont involve the carina
N2 = ipsilateral mediastinal or subcarinal nodes
T3 tumours are 5-7cm OR with extension to:
Chest wall
Diaphgragm
Pericardium
Satellite nodules within the same lobe
  N3 = contralateral hilar, mediastinal or supraclavicular nodes
    M1 = bilateral lesions, malignant pleural effusion, distant metastases
T4 tumours affect mediastinal organs, carina, vertebral body
    T1 and T2 both have further subdivisions.
Unresectable tumours are T4, N3 or M1.
Beyond TNM staging patients with similar prognostic outcomes are given further stages. Simple observation of these groupings reveals the following:
Stage I patients MUST be N0
Stage III patients MUST have a sum â¥ 3 (ie T2N2M0, or T1N2M0). [NB some patients with Stage II will also have a sum of 3 (for example T2N1M0) however ALL stage III patients have a sum â¥ 3.]
Stage IIIb patients are unresectable â stage IIIb is denoted either by N3 status or T4N2.",True,"The presence of a satellite nodule in the lingula is indicative of a more advanced stage of lung cancer, which is associated with a poorer prognosis. This is because the satellite nodule indicates that the cancer has spread beyond the primary tumor site, making it more difficult to treat and, in turn, leading to a poorer overall prognosis.",3,"3.

Please note that the question asks which feature is NOT consistent with an inhaled foreign body.
Inhaled foreign body
This is an important differential diagnosis to consider in paediatrics, particularly in younger mobile children in whom an accurate history may not be forthcoming. Not all foreign bodies are radio-opaque. Inhaled foreign bodies are slightly more likely to enter the right main bronchus than the left owing to its straighter course but left sided foreign bodies are by no means unheard of. Usually an inhaled foreign body will cause a ball-valve mechanism on the affected side leading to air-trapping and over-inflation. This gives rise to the CXR features described in the vignette. It is worth noting that the chest x-ray can also be normal in around a third of cases.",False,"Diaphragmatic flattening is not a consistent finding with an inhaled foreign body.

9321,205212,A 45-year-old woman is being reviewed in the gastroenterology clinic. She has symptoms of worsening crampy abdominal pains which have been developing over the last few months. A year ago she finished treatment for cervical cancer but follow up blood results have been normal since then. She undergoes a CT scan for further investigation. There is mural thickening to the terminal ileum and a stretch of distal ileum located within the pelvis. Which of the following is the most likely explanation for these findings?,SBA: Gastrointestinal,Radiation enteritis,Typhlitis,Crohn disease,Tuberculosis,Infective colitis,A,80%,9%,7%,3%,1%,"Explanation:
Radiation enteritis
Acutely following radiation therapy there is cell death of the rapidly turning over mucosal cells of the bowel wall, and particularly of the terminal ileum. This leads to ulceration and mucosal/submucosal oedema.
Subacutely to chronically the radiation damage leads to endarteritis obliterans and chronic mesenteric ischaemia. The bowel does heal but fibrous changes persist and strictures can form. There is no link in severity between the acute and chronic forms; the presence or absence of the one does not predict the other.
The bowel loops can be seen to be fixed in the same positions on sequential contrast studies by a desmoplastic response within the mesentery. Patients complain of crampy abdominal pain from intermittent obstruction as well as diarrhoea.
  Neutropenic colitis also known as typhlitis
The name typhlitis comes from the greek typhlos meaning blind ending sac and relates to the involvement of the caecum. Although the rest of the bowel can be affected it is the caecum which bears the brunt of this disease. The caecal wall becomes thickened (to >4mm) and markedly oedematous; the appearance may be so extreme that it may seem more like a large fluid density mass than part of the bowel. Barium studies carry a significant risk of perforation and should be avoided but would show oedema and severe ulceration. On CT transmural oedema with adjacent fat stranding is found. It develops in immunocompromised patients, in particular those undergoing induction chemotherapy prior to bone marrow transplantation.
  Tuberculosis
Abdominal tuberculosis most commonly affects the ileocaecal junction with thickening of the ileocaecal valve and narrowing of the terminal ileum. This can be seen on fluoroscopic examination as the Fleischner sign or umbrella sign where the gaping ileocaecal valve abuts the thin, strictured terminal ileum. Local lymph node enlargement with or without central low attenuation to the lymph nodes may be seen on CT. Multiple different lesions in multiple sites (i.e. skip lesions) is also a feature and a characteristic feature is of elevation of the margins of an ulcer which follow the orientation of lymphoid follicles. In the colon this means the margins are elevated in the transverse plane but in the terminal ileum they are longitudinal.
The involvement of the ileocaecal valve and the presence of skip lesions means that a key differential diagnosis is Crohn disease. Over half of cases of abdominal tuberculosis will have concurrent ascites whereas this is a relatively rare feature for Crohn disease and can be used as a discriminator.
Specifically relating to the stomach, tuberculosis can cause pyloric stenosis, multiple deep ulcers on the lesser curve, and linitis plastic type narrowing of the antrum.
  Crohn disease
Crohn disease is characterised by discontinuous (skip lesions) transmural non-caseating granulomatous inflammation. By contrast, ulcerative colitis is characterised by continuous mucosal inflammation. Crohn disease is usually diagnosed in adolescence or young adulthood and patients present with non-specific abdominal pains, diarrhoea, weight loss and anaemia. Crohn disease can affect any part of the entire length of the gastrointestinal tract, in contrast to ulcerative colitis which affects only the colon, but owing to the high concentration of lymphoid tissue in the terminal ileum the vast majority of patients will have terminal ileal involvement, in particular thickening of the iliocaecal valve. Aphthous ulceration is common and on endoscopy a cobblestone appearance to the mucosa can be seen where the thickened and oedematous wall is broken up by deep longitudinal fissures. Deep ârosethornâ ulcers can be seen on fluoroscopic studies. Strictures and fistulae characterise the chronic sequela of this disease.
Conditions associated with Crohn disease
Erythema nodosum
Gallstones
Oxalate ureteric calculi
Sclerosing cholangitis
Cholangiocarcinoma
Small bowel carcinoma
  Infective colitis
Infective colitis causes oedematous mural thickening and mural enhancement with the different underlying organism affecting slightly different segments of bowel (albeit with much overlap). Pericolic fat stranding and ascites are variably seen.

Questions on MRI are becoming more frequent in the 2A to reflect modern practice and an understanding of useful sequences and techniques is essential.

Normal lymph nodes can and do demonstrate restricted diffusion too but this effect tends to be more marked in pathological lymph nodes though there is some overlap between benign and pathological lymph nodes at the low end of the spectrum. Nevertheless, a lymph node which is found to be strongly restricting diffusion, even if it appears otherwise morphologically benign should be suspected to be involved.",False,"Post contrast enhancement is the most suggestive feature of metastatic nodal involvement on MRI.

  IPF (Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis) can only be diagnosed in the absence of a precipitating condition such as asbestosis, rheumatoid arthritis, or drug toxicity. Where such exists, the condition is termed UIP (Usual interstitial pneumonia). CFA (Crytpogenic fibrosing alveolitis) is a historic term for the same thing.
There is much overlap in the features of the various different fibrotic lung diseases.
Therefore, look for specific features which are most strongly associated with the different conditions. The table below (despite appearances) simplifies the overall situation significantly and is inadequate for real life radiology but does provide a framework on which to build further understanding of these conditions.
The features in bold are the most prominent in each of the conditions.
  Diagnosis Feature
IPF = UIP = CFA Macrocystic honeycombing, apicobasilar gradient
NSIP Peripheral, associated with CREST/Sjogrens/RA, chemotherapy
COP = BOOP Patchy. Associated with connective tissue diseases, CF, methotrexate, post-transplant
RBILD Smoking, young patients, no bronchiectasis or honeycombing
DIP Smoking, GGO, difficult to tell apart from RBILD
AIP âOutpatient ARDSâ, spares costophrenic angles
LIP Diffuse pattern, associated with Sjogrens, autoimmune conditions, Hep B, EBV, PCP

Radiotherapy stricture
In patients receiving radiotherapy to the perineum for prostate cancer, a urethral stricture can be a late complicating feature, occurring around 1-2 years following treatment. The stricture usually occurs at the bulbomembranous portion of the urethra, just distal to the prostate itself (i.e. at the prostatic apex). Patients who have previously undergone a TURP are at increased risk of developing a post-radiotherapy stricture. They will be seen as a smooth stricture on imaging.
Traumatic stricture
A previous traumatic straddle injury classically gives a short segment stricture of the bulbous urethra. In a straddle injury, the urethra is compressed against the pubic symphysis, often from a bicycle crossbar. A gonococcal infection causes a long, irregular stricture of the distal bulbous urethra.
Iatrogenic stricture
These can form following instrumentation, including prolonged catheterisation. They tend to be longer and smoother than other types of stricture. They usually occur at the main pre-existing narrow areas of the membranous urethra, bladder neck and meatus.
Infectious stricture
Gonococcal infections classically cause long strictures. They are most commonly irregular in nature and located in the bulbous urethra. The distal bulbous urethra is most frequently affected.",False,"I chose this answer because iatrogenic stricture is the most likely cause of a smooth stricture at the apex of the prostate in this patient.

This patient is haemodynamically stable. In the absence of a confirmed diagnosis, a CT angiogram should be performed. Depending on local availability, MR angiography can be a useful adjunct to CT for patients who are allergic to iodinated contrast although clearly the patient must be sufficiently stable to undergo an MRI scan.
In a haemodynamically stable patient for whom the diagnosis was in doubt the correct study to perform would be a cardiac-gated CT aortogram:
Unenhanced CT thorax - This phase is important in the diagnosis of an intramural haematoma which can be difficult to pinpoint on subsequent phases.
Arterial phase CT Thorax and Abdomen - It is important to know whether a dissection extends into the abdominal aorta or iliac arteries as well as whether there is any compromise of the mesenteric or renal arteries.
(Portal venous phase CT Thorax and Abdomen - This phase is not always performed but is most useful if previous repairs have been undertaken and a leak is suspected)
  Although not universally available, cardiac-gating of CT scans for acute aortic syndrome is optimal to reduce the rate of false positives which are a well-documented pit-fall to non-gated studies.
Depending on local availability, MR angiography can be a useful adjunct to CT for patients who are allergic to iodinated contrast although clearly the patient must be sufficiently stable to undergo an MRI scan.

Please note the question asks which answer is INCORRECT.
Post-arthroscopy arthralgia causes pain that begins at four hours and reaches a peak at 12 hours post-procedure. The pain is caused by a sterile chemical synovitis to the joint. A septic joint should always be considered where intervention has taken place however would manifest more insidiously over the course of the ensuing days.
The subacromial bursa should not communicate with the joint. If the patient has suffered a rotator cuff tear (particularly supraspinatus) or has undergone prior surgery then a communication may be present.",True,The correct answer is 1.

Select ONE answer only.,SBA: Paediatrics,Age <1 year,Claw sign of normal renal tissue,Reduced renal function on MAG3,Communication of the cysts with one another,Bilateral finding,A,52%,3%,39%,4%,2%,"Explanation:
Multicystic dysplastic kidney
A multicystic dysplastic kidney is the second most common cause of a neonatal abdominal mass. The normal renal architecture is entirely replaced by a non-functioning mass of cysts separated from one another by fibrous tissue. The overall appearance is said to resemble a bunch of grapes. If unilateral, the condition can be asymptomatic or can present as recurrent urinary tract infections. The most important distinction to make is from hydronephrosis which is overall the most common cause of a neonatal abdominal mass. In hydronephrosis the apparent 'cysts' will communicate whereas in multicystic dysplastic kidney the cysts are separate from one another. A MAG3 would show no renal function on that side at all (as opposed to just reduced function).
  Renal masses by age
Neonate:
Multicystic dysplastic kidney (second most common neonatal renal mass)
Mesoblastic nephroma (most common SOLID neonatal renal mass)
Nephroblastomatosis (can be a precursor to Wilms tumour)
  Pre-school:
Multilocular cystic nephroma (affects boys, slightly younger than Wilms)
Wilms tumour (most common SOLID mass of childhood)
Lymphoma (can affect teenagers and adults as well)

Pyloric stenosis
This tends to present within a few weeks of birth with projectile non-bilious vomiting. The hypertrophied pylorus can often be felt as an olive-shaped mass on abdominal palpation and its appearance on imaging gives rise to numerous different signs (Caterpillar sign, shoulder sign, beak sign, diamond sign, double track sign, mushroom sign and string sign). Of these the string sign (a narrow track of barium passing through a long pyloric canal) is said to be the most specific. Importantly, a normal abdominal radiograph does not exclude the diagnosis. Ultrasound is the most useful test to perform and the main differential diagnosis on clinical grounds is of reflux.

10156,205212,A 34-year-old man with a long history of Crohn disease is reviewed in the gastroenterology clinic. He has been experiencing worsening pain and discharge from the perianal area and his gastroenterologist suspects he may have an active perianal fistula. An MRI is arranged for further investigation. Which would be the best sequence to confirm the diagnosis?,SBA: Gastrointestinal,T1 with contrast,T1 without contrast,T2 with contrast,T2 without contrast,STIR,A,44%,3%,8%,13%,32%,"Explanation:
Perianal fistulae
Most perianal fistulas are thought to result from an initial infection in an intersphincteric gland. Abscesses here would normally drain into the anal canal but fistulous tracts can develop if the glands is occluded. Slices should be obtained axially to the path of the rectum. Owing to the inflammation and granulation tissue in a fistulous tract there is avid enhancement with gadolinium. T1 post-contrast images are therefore the best means by which to assess patients with active disease. If the high signal persists on unenhanced T1 images it is likely to be due to the presence of haemorrhage. STIR sequences can also be useful to track the high signal of a fistulous tract but spatial resolution is usually poorer. Chronic fistulas develop fibrotic tissue which becomes low in signal on both T1 and T2.
Perianal fistulae are classified according to their relationship to the external sphincter with inter-sphincteric fistulae being the most common since the external sphincter provides a reasonably robust barrier to the spread of an infection.
  Perianal fistula - Park's classification
Inter-sphincteric
70%
Does not cross the external sphincter, remains medial to it
Trans-sphincteric
25%
Crosses the external sphincter (as well as the internal one)
Supra-sphincteric
5%
Courses superiorly over the top of the external sphincter and exits the pelvis through the puborectalis muscle
Extra-sphincteric
<1%
Begins higher up in the rectum, avoids both sphincters, exits the pelvis through the levator ani complex and into the ischiorectal fossa
Submucosal / superficial
-
Not included in the classification. Remains superficial to both sphincters.

Please note that the question asks which answer is FALSE.
  Complex regional pain syndrome also known as Sudeck dystrophy
Patients develop chronic pain in an area previously affected by an, often disproportionately mild, injury. The pain is said to be burning in nature and symptoms of allodynia (pain with stimuli which would not normally be painful) and hyperalgesia (excessive sensitivity to pain) are also usually described. By contrast, reduced sensation is not normally found. On x-ray there is juxta-articular osteopenia with sub-periosteal bone resorption but preservation of the joint spaces.

Discrepancy between the history and apparent injuries
Delay seeking medical attention
Metaphyseal fractures (corner or bucket-handle)
Multiple fractures of different ages
Scapula fractures
Posterior rib fractures
Sternal fractures
Skull fractures (especially non-parietal, or crossing sutures)

Lymphoma
Testicular lymphoma is classically seen in an older man with bilateral hypoechoic lesions.
Teratomas, Yolk sac tumours, Embryonal cell tumours and Choriocarcinomas all fall into the category of Non-seminomatous Germ Cell tumours. Of these, Embryonal cell tumours make up the vast majority.
Teratoma
This is the second most common tumour in boys under 5. aFP is usually normal. Under ultrasound it appears as a heterogenous complex mass.
Yolk sac tumour
This makes up 80% of childhood testicular tumours.This can often present as testicular enlargement without a focal mass. It metastases to lung which is the most common site of recurrent disease.
Embryonal cell tumour
This is the second most common testicular tumour. It is the most aggressive of all testicular tumours with visceral metastases common and 5 year survival of 30%.
Choriocarcinoma
This is a rare tumour affecting 20-30-year-olds with rapid metastases to lung, liver, GI tract, brain. Often causes haemorrhage in both primary and metastatic lesions. Causes gynaecomastia in 10% due to raised serum hCG.
In reality, tumours are often mixed histological types (around 35% cases). Testicular tumours can also be diagnosed with a strong pre-test probability based solely on age as detailed in the table below. In reality, the role of the radiologist however does not need to be as complex as suggesting the final histological diagnosis. Establishing the presence of a testicular mass is sufficient. Patients should then be referred on to the urology MDT. On ultrasound there will be an intratesticular low reflectivity well-defined mass. Colour doppler flow can be seen within the mass.

8861,205212,A 76-year-old lady with a biopsy proven rectal adenocarcinoma undergoes an MRI scan for local staging. Her case is discussed at the local MDT and the radiologist points to invasion of a thin black line on the T2 weighted sequences. Since the tumour has clearly breached this line the decision is made that she should receive neo-adjuvant chemotherapy prior to surgical resection instead of going straight for surgery. Which structure is seen as a thin black line on T2 weighted sequences in this way?,SBA: Gastrointestinal,Mesorectal fascia,Muscularis fascia,Anorectal angle,Serosa,Muscularis mucosa,A,70%,7%,2%,10%,11%,"Explanation:
In an ideal world every trainee radiologist would have all the intricacies of staging for all tumour types committed to memory. A qualified subspecialist radiologist could reasonably be expected to be extremely familiar with the staging for cancers within their remit but for the majority of trainees it is simply not practical to memorise each and every staging scheme. As an overall strategy, the most important stages to understand are those which change the management for patients.
  Rectal cancer MRI
The muscularis propria is the outer wall of the rectum and shows up as low signal on T2 weighted sequences.
Since the rectum (like the oesophagus) does not have a serosa, once spread beyond the muscularis propria into the mesorectal fat has occurred (ie a T3 tumour), nodal involvement is also feasible. The mesorectal fascia is a thin plane of connective tissue which contains fat, the rectum, local lymph nodes as a distinct anatomical entity and is of paramount importance in rectal cancer management. Spread beyond the mesorectal fascia denotes a T4 tumour. MRI is excellent for local staging of rectal cancer because the mesorectal fascia is seen clearly as a thin black line on T2 weighted sequences and its involvement or lack thereof can be readily discerned. In contrast, the tumour appears as intermediate signal on T2, distorting the normal anatomy. The fascia is also referred to as the âCRMâ which stands for circumferential resection margin and relates to the surgical operation performed for rectal tumours, namely a total mesorectal excision (TME). The proximity of the tumour extent to the CRM is prognostically important; tumours with a >1mm margin before they reach the CRM are far less likely to recur. A <1mm margin is taken as involvement of the CRM.
A distinction is also drawn between lower and upper rectal tumours (as defined by distance from the anorectal angle). Inferiorly there is far less fat contained within the mesorectal fascia and consequently tumour can involve the CRM earlier on.
  Rectal cancer staging
The following table heavily paraphrases the TNM stages for rectal cancer. There are multiple subdivisions which are not covered here either. The focus for this table is radiologically distinct entities as well as the points at which the management alters.
  Stage Radiology Management
<T3 Not involving the muscularis propria Surgical resection (must also have N0, if N1 or N2 then would need neo-adjuvant chemotherapy)
T3 Involving muscularis propria Neo-adjuvant chemoradiotherapy â surgery â+/- post-op chemotherapy
T4 Beyond the CRM Neo-adjuvant chemoradiotherapy â surgery â+/- post-op chemotherapy
N1 1-3 nodes It is important to discern if any of the nodes are situated outside of the CRM â these will not routinely be resected in a TME but can be resected separately or included in radiotherapy fields.
N2 4 or more lymph nodes It is important to discern if any of the nodes are situated outside of the CRM â these will not routinely be resected in a TME but can be resected separately or included in radiotherapy fields.
M1 External iliac, inguinal nodes, hepatic metastases
Solitary hepatic metastases can potentially still be curatively resected.
Palliative chemotherapy.
Palliative stenting.
 ",True,"The mesorectal fascia is a thin black line seen on T2 weighted sequences and is commonly used to assess the extent of rectal cancer. It is a layer of connective tissue that surrounds the rectum and is important for determining the extent of the cancer, as it can indicate whether or not the cancer has spread beyond the rectum and into the surrounding tissue. If the cancer has breached the mesorectal fascia, it is generally recommended that the patient receive neo-adjuvant chemotherapy prior to surgical resection.",1,"3. A question about medical ethics.

11246,205212,A 40 -year-old lady complains to her GP of discomfort on passing urine as well as post-void dribbling. She also reports that recently she has found it painful to have sex. Her GP examines her and finds a tender area on the anterior vaginal wall on palpation. What is the most likely diagnosis?,"SBA: Genito urinary, Adrenal, Obstetrics & Gynaecology and Breast",Urethral diverticulum,Aberrant insertion of the ureter,Gartner duct cyst,Skene duct cyst,Bartholin gland cyst,A,38%,2%,35%,18%,8%,"Explanation:
A uretherocoele will not present as a lump per se, since any residual urine within it is there passively i.e. it is not contained.
Anatomy is the key to differentiating between the various female urogenital cysts most of which are, for the most part, asymptomatic incidental findings.
  Image Â© Medical Exam Prep
    Urethral diverticulum also known as urethrocoele
Dysuria, dyspareunia and post-void dribbling are classical for this condition. An outpouching of the urethral mucosa protrudes through the smooth muscle. This is seen on MRI as high T2 signal adjacent to or surrounding the urethra. Urinary stasis within the diverticulum predisposes patients to the formation of calculi, which can be seen as low signal on the T2 scan, and adenocarcinoma which will enhance with gadolinium.
  Gartner duct cyst
These are usually found incidentally on MRI scans but can cause dyspareunia. They do not communicate with the urethra and would be unlikely to cause post-void dribbling. They are remnants of the Wolffian ducts and occur superiorly in the anterolateral wall of the vagina. On imaging they appear straightforwardly cystic. For the most part they occur sporadically but they can also be seen in conjunction with renal agenesis or ectopia and are also typical of a rare condition called Herlyn-Werner-Wunderlich syndrome. This condition causes duplication of all or part of the female genital tract with unilateral haematometrocolpos and ipsilateral renal agenesis. 
  Skene duct cyst
These are retention cysts of the paraurethral ducts and usually they are asymptomatic. On MRI they are seen inferior to the pubic symphysis but lateral to the external urethral meatus. Signal characteristics reflect their cystic nature with high T2 signal but fluid-fluid levels may also be present if there has been intracystic haemorrhage.
  Bartholin gland cyst
The bartholin glands secrete lubricating fluid into the inferior third of the vagina. They are found in highest numbers at the posterolateral aspect of the inferior vagina. Although usually asymptomatic, when infected or inflamed a Bartholin gland cyst can present as a painful lump. On MRI they show as high T1 signal owing to the mucoid fluid.
  Ectopic ureter
The ureter normally inserts into the trigone of the bladder but ectopic insertions do occur. If these are below the external urethral sphincter the patient may experience dribbling symptoms however these are likely to have been present from birth. An ectopic ureter may be an isolated diagnosis or may form part of a VACTERL presentation and there is an affiliation to renal duplexity. Vesico-ureteric reflux is also very common since the normal valve mechanism is not present to prevent it. Abnormal ureteric anatomy is well demonstrated either with fluoroscopic studies or a highly T2 weighted sequence on an MRI scan.",False,"The most likely diagnosis for this patient is a Bartholin gland cyst. This is because the patient is reporting symptoms that are consistent with this condition, such as discomfort on passing urine and post-void dribbling, as well as pain during sexual intercourse.

An ectopic pregnancy occurs when the fertilised egg implants outside of the uterus. Ectopic pregnancies occur in the Fallopian tubes in the majority of cases (>95%). Other locations can occur, for example the abdomen, cervix and ovary, but these are all rare.
The commonest anatomical location for an ectopic pregnancy to occur in the Fallopian tube is the ampulla. The approximate percentages of ectopic pregnancies occurring in each part of the Fallopian tubes is as follows:
The ampulla â 70%
The isthmus â 10-15%
The infundibulum â 10-15%
The uterine part â 2-5%",True,"I chose the ampulla of the Fallopian tube as the commonest anatomical location for an ectopic pregnancy to occur because the ampulla is the widest and longest portion of the Fallopian tube, making it the most likely area for a fertilized egg to become implanted.

The colon is the part of the large intestine that is situated between the caecum and the rectum. It receives digested food from the small intestine, from which it absorbs water and ions to form faeces. It is approximately 150 cm in length and is divided into four parts.
  1. Ascending colon:
This is the first part of the colon and is retroperitoneal. It ascends upwards from the caecum before turning right at a 90 degree angle at the right colic flexure (hepatic flexure) to become the transverse colon. It is approximately 20 cm long.
  2. Transverse colon:
This is the second part of the colon and is intraperitoneal. It extends transversely across the abdomen from the right colic flexure until it reaches the left colic flexure (splenic flexure) close to the spleen. Here it turns another 90 degrees inferiorly to become the descending colon. The transverse colon is the least fixed part of the colon. It is approximately 50 cm long.
  3. Descending colon:
This is the third part of the colon and is retroperitoneal in the majority of people. It extends inferiorly down the abdomen from the left colic flexure passing over the lateral border of the left kidney. At the point that it turns medially it becomes the sigmoid colon. It is approximately 30 cm long.
  4. Sigmoid colon:
This is the final part of the colon and is intraperitoneal. It extends downwards in an âSâ shape from the left iliac fossa to the level of the S3 vertebra. It is approximately 50 cm long.

13858,231994,A 28-year-old man presents with pain in his right wrist following a fall from a pushbike. X-rays of his wrist demonstrate a fracture of his scaphoid bone. Which SINGLE statement regarding the scaphoid bone is FALSE? Select ONE answer only.,SBA: Musculoskeletal and Trauma,The proximal portion has the most abundant blood supply,It articulates with the radius,It is palpable at the base of the thenar eminence,It receives its blood supply from the radial artery,It is the largest bone in the proximal carpal row,A,83%,2%,5%,5%,5%,"Explanation:
  Please note that the question asks for the answer which is FALSE.
    The scaphoid bone is one of the carpal bones of the wrist. It is situated between the hand and forearm on the radial side of the wrist. It is the largest bone of the proximal row of wrist bones. It can be felt at the base of the thenar eminence and also within the anatomical snuffbox.
Within the anatomical snuffbox the scaphoid bone and the radius articulate to form part of the wrist joint. Tenderness in the anatomical snuffbox following a fall onto an outstretched hand should lead to suspicion of a scaphoid fracture.
Its blood supply is primarily supplied by the lateral and distal branches of the radial artery. There is a good blood supply to the middle and distal parts of the bone but the proximal portion is neglected and relies on âretrogradeâ flow. A fracture of the scaphoid bone can disrupt the blood supply to the proximal portion. Failure to revascularise the scaphoid can result in avascular necrosis and arthritis.

Adenomas, hepatocellular carcinomas, focal nodular hyperplasias, and metastatic colonic carcinomas typically have different imaging findings on MRI that would not match the findings described in this case.",2,,C,False,"I chose option 2, haemangioma, because the findings on the antenatal ultrasound and post-partum MR imaging are consistent with the typical characteristics of a hepatic haemangioma. 

The focal hyperechoic lesion on ultrasound is a common appearance of haemangiomas, which are benign vascular liver lesions. The post-partum MR findings further support this diagnosis: the central area of high signal intensity on T2-weighted pre-contrast sequences is consistent with the blood-filled spaces within the haemangioma. The intense enhancement with IV gadolinium on T1-weighted at 25 seconds post-injection indicates rapid contrast uptake by the lesion, which is also typical for haemangiomas due to their vascular nature. Finally, the isodensity with normal liver on T1-weighted at 75 seconds after IV gadolinium suggests that the lesion is not malignant, as malignant tumors usually retain contrast and appear hyperintense compared to normal liver tissue.

The other options are less likely based on the imaging findings and clinical context:

1. Adenoma: Hepatic adenomas are benign liver tumors often associated with oral contraceptive use or pregnancy. However, they usually have different imaging characteristics, such as heterogeneous enhancement and variable signal intensity on T2-weighted images.

3. Hepatocellular carcinoma: This is a malignant liver tumor, which is less likely in a young patient with no known risk factors (negative hepatitis serology and normal liver function tests). The imaging findings are also not consistent with hepatocellular carcinoma, which typically shows arterial enhancement and washout on delayed phases.

4. Focal nodular hyperplasia: This benign liver lesion can have similar imaging findings to haemangiomas, but the enhancement pattern is typically different, with a central scar and radiating fibrous septa.

1. Localization: The 99mTc RBC scan demonstrated accumulation across the upper abdomen, which was interpreted to be the proximal transverse colon. The proximal transverse colon is supplied by the superior mesenteric artery (SMA). Therefore, catheterizing the SMA would maximize the chance of demonstrating the bleeding point.

2. Most likely cause: Angiodysplasia is a common cause of lower gastrointestinal bleeding, particularly in older patients. It is characterized by abnormal, dilated blood vessels in the mucosal and submucosal layers of the gastrointestinal tract. Given the patient's age and presentation with bright red rectal bleeding, angiodysplasia is a more likely cause than a villous adenoma.

The ultrasound findings of a hypoechoic mildly lobulated lesion 1 cm in diameter are more suggestive of one of the other four diagnoses.,2,,E,True,"I chose option 3, intraglandular lymph node, as the least likely diagnosis for the following reasons:

1. Warthin's tumor: This is a benign salivary gland tumor that commonly occurs in the parotid gland, but it can also occur in the submandibular gland. It usually presents as a painless, slow-growing mass and can appear as a hypoechoic lesion on ultrasound.

2. Adenoid cystic tumor: This is a malignant tumor that can arise in the salivary glands, including the submandibular gland. It typically presents as a slow-growing, painless mass and can appear as a hypoechoic lesion on ultrasound.

4. Pleomorphic adenoma: This is the most common benign salivary gland tumor and can occur in the submandibular gland. It usually presents as a painless, slow-growing mass and can appear as a hypoechoic lesion on ultrasound.

5. Post-inflammatory sialectatic cavity: This can develop as a result of chronic inflammation or infection in the salivary gland, leading to the formation of a cystic cavity. This can appear as a hypoechoic lesion on ultrasound.

Given the ultrasound findings and clinical presentation, all of the above options are more likely than an intraglandular lymph node, which would typically appear as a more well-defined, oval or round hypoechoic structure on ultrasound.

Additionally, the absence of susceptibility on GRE images and the lack of enhancement in post-contrast images further support this diagnosis. 

Cavernous malformation (option 1) and arteriovenous malformation (option 2) would typically show susceptibility on GRE images due to the presence of blood products.

This is a classic feature of Candida esophagitis and is not seen in other esophageal diseases such as reflux esophagitis, glycogenic acanthosis, or adenocarcinoma of the esophagus.

The chest radiograph demonstrates bilateral perihilar ground glass opacities with fine reticular changes, which could be suggestive of an infectious process. The CT scan shows uniform circumferential thickening of the esophagus, which is also consistent with inflammation or infection.

The esophagram findings are particularly indicative of Candida esophagitis. The longitudinally oriented plaques and areas of cobblestone confluent plaques are characteristic of this condition. Candida esophagitis is a fungal infection of the esophagus that typically occurs in immunocompromised individuals or those with predisposing factors such as diabetes or antibiotic use.
