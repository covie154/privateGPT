14052,201667,"A 42-year-old lady undergoes an ultrasound scan for investigation of recurrent UTIs. This identifies a well-defined, heterogeneous but predominantly echogenic 5cm lesion superior to the right kidney. An MRI scan is performed which shows the lesion is arising from the adrenal gland. The lesion has hyperintense areas on T1 with signal drop-out on out-of-phase imaging. Areas of low T1 signal are also seen within the lesion. What is the most likely diagnosis? Select ONE answer only.","SBA: Genito urinary, Adrenal, Obstetrics & Gynaecology and Breast",Myelolipoma,Adrenal adenoma,Aldosterone secreting neuroendocrine tumour,Cortical carcinoma,Melanoma metastasis,A,65%,23%,6%,4%,2%,"Explanation:
Myelolipoma is a benign tumour with large areas of fat within. Only about ¼ have calcification. On MRI, myeloid is seen as focal areas of low T1 signal. The lesions are present with retroperitoneal haemorrhage. They are associated with endocrine disorders, but do not cause them, such as Cushings and Conn's.
With any lesion on an MRI scan the key to diagnosis lies in determining the tissue content. Try to decide if a lesion contains fat, fluid, blood or all three by going through the tissue types one by one.
Each different sequence helps to eliminate/rule-in the different tissue types.
Blood - high on T1 and does not suppress on T1 fat saturated sequences (e.g. the precontrast sequence)
Fluid - high on T2. Compare with known fluid filled organs such as the bladder for pelvic scans and the gallbladder for upper abdominal scans. If the target lesion is fluid, it should not just be slightly high on T2 but should be as high as these reference organs.
Fat - high on T1 and does suppress on fat saturated sequences (macroscopic fat), or demonstrates chemical shift artefact on out of phase images (microscopic fat).
    Best sequence Other points
Blood T1 fat sat T2 shading sign (endometriomas)
Fluid T2 Compare to reference organs
Fat T1 fat sat Also in/out of phase",FALSE,"I chose number 2, Adrenal Adenoma, as the most likely diagnosis because it is the most common type of adrenal tumor. Adrenal adenomas are typically benign, well-defined, heterogeneous lesions that are predominantly echogenic on ultrasound and have hyperintense areas on T1 with signal drop-out on out-of-phase imaging. They also typically have areas of low T1 signal within the lesion. These features are consistent with the findings of the ultrasound and MRI scans described in the question.",2,,B,TRUE,"I chose option 2, Myelolipoma, because the description of the lesion in the question is consistent with the characteristics of a myelolipoma. Myelolipomas are benign adrenal tumors that are predominantly composed of fat and bone marrow elements. 

The ultrasound scan showed a well-defined, heterogeneous but predominantly echogenic lesion, which suggests the presence of fat within the lesion. The MRI findings further support this diagnosis, as the lesion has hyperintense areas on T1-weighted imaging (indicative of fat content) and signal drop-out on out-of-phase imaging (which is a feature of fat-containing lesions). Additionally, areas of low T1 signal within the lesion could represent the bone marrow elements of a myelolipoma.

The other options are less likely based on the imaging findings described:

1. Adrenal adenomas typically have a more homogeneous appearance and do not usually have the fat content seen in this case.
3. Aldosterone-secreting neuroendocrine tumors are typically smaller and do not have the same imaging characteristics as described in the question.
4. Cortical carcinomas are usually larger, more aggressive, and have different imaging features than those described.
5. Melanoma metastasis would not typically present with the fat content and imaging characteristics described in this case.",A,FALSE,FALSE
14930,201667,"A 51-year-old lady is screened for breast cancer as part of the NHS breast screening service. A lesion is seen, and the patient is recalled for further magnified views. Which of the following regarding mammography is correct?","SBA: Genito urinary, Adrenal, Obstetrics & Gynaecology and Breast",A rolled CC view is useful for separating summation shadows,An MLO is useful for investigating teacup calcifications,A rolled CC is one of the basic screening views,A true lateral is one of the basic screening views,An oblique lateral is the same as a rolled CC view,A,84%,7%,4%,2%,3%,"Explanation:
MLO and CC are the standard views performed at screening.
If further view are required these are usually decided on a case-by-case basis.
  A true lateral view can help demonstrate suspected teacup calcifications are teacup calcifications. Compression views are used to interrogate suspicious calcifications seen on mammograms further.
A rolled CC view can help separate out structures to prove that the 'mass' seen on the original mammogram was a summation shadow, or to confirm the presence of a mass.
  Teacup calcifications
Teacup calcifications are caused by liquid milk of calcium within fibrocystic change. On mammography they appear as small curvilinear thin calcifications resembling the fluid level in a teacup on lateral views and rounded on a craniocaudal view, like a teacup viewed from above. Although teacup calcifications are typically benign in nature and suggestive of only fibrocystic changes they must be distinguished from suspicious calcifications. Thus, the best views for confirming the presence of teacup calcifications would be a true lateral, as opposed to an oblique lateral, and a CC view.",FALSE,"I chose this answer because a rolled CC view is one of the basic screening views used in mammography. It is a two-view mammogram which involves taking two images of each breast, one from the top and one from the side. The rolled CC view is used to evaluate the entire breast, including the upper outer quadrant which is often difficult to image with the standard CC view. This view helps to identify any suspicious lesions or calcifications that may be present in this area.",1,"3. A question about the application of knowledge, what is the best course of action?

This question falls under option 3: A question about the application of knowledge, what is the best course of action.",C,TRUE,"I chose option 3 because a rolled CC (craniocaudal) view is useful for separating summation shadows in mammography. Summation shadows occur when normal breast tissue overlaps, creating the appearance of a mass or lesion. By performing a rolled CC view, the radiologist can reposition the breast tissue, helping to separate these overlapping structures and determine if the observed abnormality is a true lesion or just a summation artifact. This technique aids in providing a more accurate diagnosis.",A,TRUE,A
10586,201667,A patient with a known history of von Recklinghausen disease (NF1) is being investigated for hypertension. Which of the following is the most likely explanation?,SBA: Cardiothoracic and vascular,Renal artery stenosis,Atherosclerosis,Renal AVMs,Renal glomerular basement membrane pathology,Nephritic syndrome,A,77%,3%,12%,5%,3%,"Explanation:
Renal artery stenosis is known to be associated with Neurofibromatosis type 1, also known as von Recklinghausen disease.
There are three main aetiologies of renal artery stenosis. The most prevalent is atherosclerosis. Fibromuscular dysplasia is the second most common and is classically given as affecting a relatively young woman with beading (string of beads) of the mid and distal renal arteries seen, for which the management is angioplasty. Finally a small number of cases are secondary to a variety of conditions such as Buerger disease, Takayasu disease and neurofibromatosis.
The significance of diagnosis of atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis is in avoiding the use of ACE inhibitors. The ASTRAL trial showed that there was no long term benefit of stenting the stenoses over best medical management, although there was still a reduction in the number of episodes of flash pulmonary oedema experienced by the patients.",FALSE,"Renal arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) are a known complication of von Recklinghausen disease (NF1). They are caused by an abnormal connection between the arteries and veins of the kidneys, which can lead to hypertension. This is the most likely explanation for the patient’s hypertension in this case.",2,"This question would fall under the category of clinical judgement, what is the correct diagnosis?",D,TRUE,"I chose option 2, Renal artery stenosis, because von Recklinghausen disease, also known as Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), is a genetic disorder that affects the growth and development of nerve cell tissues. This can lead to the formation of benign tumors called neurofibromas, which can occur anywhere in the body, including the renal arteries.

Renal artery stenosis is a narrowing of the renal arteries, which supply blood to the kidneys. In patients with NF1, neurofibromas or other vascular abnormalities can cause compression or narrowing of the renal arteries, leading to renal artery stenosis. This can result in reduced blood flow to the kidneys, which in turn can cause hypertension (high blood pressure) as the kidneys release hormones to increase blood pressure in response to the decreased blood flow.

The other options are less likely to be associated with NF1 and hypertension:

1. Atherosclerosis: While it can cause hypertension, it is not specifically associated with NF1.
3. Renal AVMs: Arteriovenous malformations are rare in NF1 and not a common cause of hypertension in these patients.
4. Renal glomerular basement membrane pathology: This is more commonly associated with other renal diseases, not specifically with NF1.
5. Nephritic syndrome: This refers to a group of symptoms related to kidney inflammation and damage, which is not specifically associated with NF1.",A,FALSE,B
14381,201667,You are reviewing a trauma CT scan of a 16-year-old boy who was involved in a coach crash. He is intubated and ventilated and nothing is known about his past medical history. As well as multiple thoracic abnormalities you also notice that the pancreas is absent. What is the most likely diagnosis? Select ONE answer only.,SBA: Paediatrics,Cystic fibrosis,Type 1 diabetes,Type 2 diabetes,Traumatic amputation,Diabetes insipidus,A,88%,7%,1%,4%,1%,"Explanation:
Cystic fibrosis
An absent finding such as asplenia can be harder to detect than the presence of an abnormality. In cystic fibrosis the pancreatic parenchyma becomes entirely replaced by fatty infiltration to such an extent that it blends almost imperceptibly with the intra-abdominal fat and appears completely absent. Patients suffer from pancreatic failure and require high dose enzyme replacement.
  Distal Intestinal Obstruction Syndrome (DIOS)
The description of a bubbly area on an abdominal radiograph is more usually linked to meconium ileus. DIOS is also referred to as a meconium ileus equivalent as these two conditions are similar. In patients with cystic fibrosis the thicker-than-normal intestinal mucus, increase in transit time and pancreatic insufficiency all conspire to cause faecal impaction. This often occurs in early adolescence when parental control wears thin and concordance with medical management (in particular pancreatic enzyme replacement) of their cystic fibrosis can become an issue. Patients develop colicky right lower quadrant pain and tenderness when faecal matter obstructs around the terminal ileum. On x-ray this can sometimes be seen as a bubbly area close to where the caecum might be expected to be.",FALSE,"The most likely diagnosis in this case is traumatic amputation. This is because the absence of the pancreas on the CT scan is most likely due to the trauma from the coach crash, which could have caused the pancreas to be completely or partially removed. Type 1 and type 2 diabetes, diabetes insipidus, and cystic fibrosis are all conditions that can affect the pancreas, but in this case, the absence of the pancreas is most likely due to the trauma of the crash.",2,,D,TRUE,"I chose option 2, Cystic fibrosis, because it is a genetic disorder that can cause the pancreas to be underdeveloped or absent. In this case, the absence of the pancreas is not likely due to the trauma from the coach crash, as traumatic amputation would not affect the pancreas. Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes are related to insulin production and resistance, respectively, but do not cause the pancreas to be absent. Diabetes insipidus is related to the regulation of water balance in the body and is not associated with the pancreas. Therefore, Cystic fibrosis is the most likely diagnosis given the information provided.",A,TRUE,A
14407,201667,You are reviewing an MRI scan of a 45-year-old woman who recently underwent a successful uterine artery embolisation for management of menorrhagia. Which of the following is a complication of this procedure? Select ONE answer only.,SBA: Cardiothoracic and vascular,Ovarian dysfunction,Meig syndrome,Dermoid formation,Asherman syndrome,Endometrioma,A,85%,3%,1%,10%,2%,"Explanation:
Asherman syndrome
Historically this condition was the result of infection with tuberculosis but nowadays it is more often the consequence of iatrogenic endometrial damage. The formation of intrauterine synechiae leads to subfertility and these fibrous bands can be seen on HSG as filling defects and surface irregularity. Asherman syndrome should not occur following uterine artery embolisation.
In the world of interventional radiology, uterine fibroid embolisation is gaining momentum. The uterine artery arises from the internal iliac artery whereas the ovarian artery arises directly from the aorta and its branches have a corkscrew appearance on angiography. Anastomoses between the two arteries or the two sides exist in approximately 20% of patients. Patients should be counselled for the risk of ovarian dysfunction subsequent to the procedure and patients over the age of 45 are at particular risk. Pedunculated fibroids are said to be poor candidates for embolisation owing to their propensity to detach however the literature is slightly contradictory on this topic.
Following a successful embolisation the fibroid should undergo infarction and involution. On an MRI scan there will be high T1 signal with low T2 signal and no enhancement of the infarcted tissue post-contrast.
Complications include:
Infections (Endometritis, PID and TOA)
DVT / PE - due to compression of pelvic veins by enlarged uterus (therefore a complication of the underlying pathology as opposed to the procedure itself)
Ovarian dysfunction - increased risk >45years due to greater propensity for uterine-ovarian artery anastomoses. Careful examination of pre-procedure MR angiography images helps reduce this risk
Fibroid passage
Haemorrhage
Uterine necrosis - look for lack of endometrial enhancement
  Meig syndrome
This is a triad of an ovarian fibroma (usually, other ovarian tumours do cause it too), ascites and pleural effusions. A right sided pleural effusion is more common than the left. The underlying mechanism is unclear. Two possible explanations are that either the tumour irritates the peritoneum leading to a build-up of inflammatory fluid, or that histamine release alongside other chemicals and hormones causes vasodilation and fluid exudation that way.",FALSE,"Asherman syndrome is a known complication of uterine artery embolisation, which is a procedure used to treat menorrhagia. This syndrome is caused by the formation of intrauterine adhesions, which can lead to infertility, menstrual irregularities, and pain.",1,"3. A question about a clinical scenario, what is the best treatment?

1. Basic factual recall",D,TRUE,"I chose option 3, ovarian dysfunction, because uterine artery embolization (UAE) is a procedure that involves blocking the blood supply to the uterus, which can potentially affect the blood supply to the ovaries as well. This reduced blood flow to the ovaries can lead to ovarian dysfunction, which may manifest as hormonal imbalances, changes in menstrual cycle, or even early menopause in some cases. While the other options listed are related to gynecological conditions or complications, they are not specifically associated with the uterine artery embolization procedure.",A,FALSE,E

1. Basic factual recall, either of basic science, physics, anatomy or regarding a procedure.",E,TRUE,"I chose option 1, the ascending colon, because it is one of the structures that lies within the retroperitoneal space. The retroperitoneal space is the anatomical space in the abdominal cavity behind (retro) the peritoneum, which is the membrane that lines the abdominal cavity.

14155,201667,You are reviewing the images of a 78-year-old man. 2-years-ago he was diagnosed with bladder cancer but following resection and intravesical BCG therapy his recent scans have been clear. Of late he has been experiencing nocturia and wishes to undergo a TURP procedure. His pre-op MRI scan shows an enlarged prostate gland with diffusely low T2 signal affecting the whole gland. What is the most likely diagnosis? Select ONE answer only.,"SBA: Genito urinary, Adrenal, Obstetrics & Gynaecology and Breast",PI-RADS 5/5 prostate adenocarcinoma,Pi-RADS 5/5 prostate squamous cell carcinoma,Granulomatous prostatitis,Prostate abscess,Sarcoidosis,A,16%,2%,79%,1%,2%,"Explanation:
Even with a history of intravesical BCG therapy, prostate adenocarcinoma is more likely than granulomatous prostatitis. Biopsy confirmation is essential.
  Prostate cancer
The vast majority of cancers of the prostate are adenocarcinomas and the risk of developing prostate cancer increases with age to such an extent that by the age of 80 approximately 80% of men will have some neoplastic foci within the prostate although these may be completely occult and never manifest clinically.  Where the disease does advance it becomes one of the top three most common causes of death from cancer in men alongside lung cancer and colorectal cancer. Serum Prostatic Specific Antigen (PSA) levels have been used in prostate cancer screening since the 1990s.
  Gleason score - This is formed by identifying the most common cell morphology and second most common cell morphology. The different morphologies are compared to a five-point graded system and the two grades added together to give the final score (i.e. 4+2, 5+3 etc.). If there is only one cell morphology the score can be e.g. 3+3. Prostate cancer is defined by a minimum total grading of 6 (usually 3+3).
            MRI is crucial to provide accurate staging but is also gaining in momentum on its way to becoming a screening tool in its own right.
  The majority of prostate cancers arise from the peripheral zone and causes the normally high T2 signal to become low signal. Additionally the cancer should show restriction in diffusion (ie high signal on DWI, correspondingly low on ADC). It is important to view the T1 images as well in order to exclude the possibility of haemorrhage which can sometimes look like a prostate cancer on the T2 weighted images.
  Granulomatous prostatitis
This is an unusual condition which is said to develop following intravesical BCG therapy for bladder cancer. Other possible causes are sarcoidosis or tuberculous prostatitis. Aside from these, more recently purely idiopathic cases have also been noted. In these cases a recent UTI or urethral instrumentation have been implicated. The imaging appearances are reminiscent of a PI-RADS 5/5 prostate cancer and the diagnosis should always be made histologically. Whatever the aetiology, the patient followed up to resolution of imaging abnormalities to ensure a prostate cancer has not been masked.
Squamous cell carcinoma of the prostate accounts for very few prostate cancers. The majority are adenocarcinoma or transitional cell carcinoma.",FALSE,"The most likely diagnosis based on the pre-op MRI scan is granulomatous prostatitis. This is because the MRI scan shows an enlarged prostate gland with diffusely low T2 signal, which is a sign of inflammation. Granulomatous prostatitis is an inflammatory condition of the prostate gland that is often associated with nocturia, which the patient is experiencing. Furthermore, the patient has already undergone resection and intravesical BCG therapy for bladder cancer, which could have caused the inflammation in the prostate gland.",2,,C,FALSE,"I chose granulomatous prostatitis as the most likely diagnosis for the following reasons:

1. The patient has a history of bladder cancer and has undergone intravesical BCG therapy. BCG is a live, attenuated strain of Mycobacterium bovis that is used as an immunotherapy for bladder cancer. A known complication of this therapy is granulomatous prostatitis, which is an inflammatory condition of the prostate.

2. The MRI findings of an enlarged prostate gland with diffusely low T2 signal affecting the whole gland are consistent with granulomatous prostatitis. Inflammatory conditions, such as granulomatous prostatitis, can cause low T2 signal intensity due to increased cellularity and fibrosis.

3. While prostate adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma can also present with low T2 signal intensity, the patient's history of intravesical BCG therapy and the diffuse involvement of the entire prostate gland make granulomatous prostatitis a more likely diagnosis.

4. Prostate abscess and sarcoidosis are less likely given the patient's history and MRI findings. Prostate abscesses typically present with focal areas of low T2 signal intensity and peripheral enhancement, while sarcoidosis is a systemic disease that would likely have other manifestations beyond the prostate.

In summary, the patient's history of intravesical BCG therapy, the MRI findings of an enlarged prostate with diffusely low T2 signal intensity, and the clinical presentation make granulomatous prostatitis the most likely diagnosis.",C,TRUE,A
14294,201667,You are reviewing the MRI scan of a 37-year-old lady who has a constellation of symptoms for which she is under review by neurology. Recently she has noticed a deterioration in her vision. Which of the following is NOT a cause of optic atrophy? Select ONE answer only.,SBA: Central Nervous and Head & Neck,Myasthenia gravis,Neuromyeltitis optica,Neuritis,Multiple sclerosis,Chronic glaucoma,A,74%,3%,6%,6%,12%,"Explanation:
Optic atrophy is difficult to pick up on an MRI scan unless you are specifically looking for it. On a T2 weighted coronal sequence (particularly a CISS, heavily T2 weighted sequence) scrolling through the optic nerves you may be able to appreciate that there is too much CSF surrounding the optic nerve, particularly if it is a unilateral finding.
Myasthenia Gravis is a muscular condition where there is increased fatiguability of all muscles. The effect can be seen with the ocular muscles particularly well. The optic nerves are unaffected.
Glaucoma occurs when the pressures within the eye are greater than normal. This increased pressure damages the optic nerve and, without treatment, can lead to irreversible optic neuropathy and thereafter optic atrophy.
Optic neuritis is inflammation of the optic nerve and can occur in the context of multiple sclerosis, or in isolation. Like glaucoma, it can progress to neuropathy and atrophy.
Neuromyelitis optica is a specific condition, with similarities to multiple sclerosis, where there is optic neuritis. Usually patients have enlarged optic nerves, but chronic damage leads to optic atrophy.",TRUE,"Myasthenia gravis is a neuromuscular disorder that causes muscle weakness, but it does not cause optic atrophy. Optic atrophy is a condition that occurs when the optic nerve is damaged, and it can be caused by Neuromyelitis optica, Neuritis, Multiple Sclerosis, and Chronic Glaucoma.",1,This question falls under basic factual recall.,E,TRUE,"I chose Myasthenia gravis as the answer because it is not a cause of optic atrophy. Myasthenia gravis is an autoimmune disorder that affects the neuromuscular junction, leading to muscle weakness and fatigue. It primarily affects the voluntary muscles, including those that control eye movement and eyelid function. However, it does not cause optic atrophy, which is the damage and degeneration of the optic nerve.

The other options listed, such as Neuromyelitis optica, Neuritis, Multiple sclerosis, and Chronic glaucoma, are all conditions that can cause optic atrophy due to their direct or indirect impact on the optic nerve.",A,FALSE,E

Select ONE answer only.",SBA: Musculoskeletal and Trauma,Posterior vertebral scalloping,Rheumatoid arthritis,Hook-like osteophytes on the second and third metacarpal heads,Subperiosteal bone resoprtion,Rugger jersey spine,A,84%,1%,6%,5%,4%,"Explanation:
Acromegaly
Excess circulating growth hormone can be caused either by a pituitary adenoma (>90%) or hyperplasia of the anterior pituitary. If this occurs prior to skeletal maturation it leads to gigantism in children. Thereafter there are a number of skeletal manifestations. Some of the most widely known are prognathism and spade-like hands.
Famously, the actor Richard Kiel who played Jaws in the James Bond films ‘Moonraker’ and ‘The Spy Who Loved Me’ had acromegaly.
Other important characteristics to look for are as follows:
Enlargement of the paranasal sinuses – 75%
Posterior vertebral scalloping – 30%
Widening of the terminal tufts
Heel pad thickness >25mm
Premature osteoarthritis
Enlargement and erosion of the sella
Hyperostosis of the inner table of the skull",FALSE,"I chose this answer because hook-like osteophytes are a common symptom of acromegaly, which is characterized by an enlargement of the sella and paranasal sinuses. Hook-like osteophytes are bony projections that form on the second and third metacarpal heads, which are located on the hands. This symptom is often seen in people with acromegaly and is a result of the excess growth hormone production.",2,,C,TRUE,"I chose option 2, ""Posterior vertebral scalloping,"" because it is a radiographic finding associated with acromegaly. Acromegaly is a hormonal disorder that occurs when the pituitary gland produces excess growth hormone, leading to an increase in bone and soft tissue growth. This can result in various skeletal abnormalities, including posterior vertebral scalloping, which refers to the concave appearance of the posterior aspect of the vertebral bodies. This scalloping is caused by the pressure from the enlarged soft tissues and ligaments on the vertebrae, leading to bone remodeling and the characteristic appearance on x-ray. The other options listed are not typically associated with acromegaly.",A,FALSE,B
12576,201667,A 45-year-old man from Mexico is brought in by his wife who says he is not himself. He is found to have focal neurology and undergoes imaging. There are tiny calcified structures in the soft tissues surrounding his hip and on MRI scanning of his head oedema surrounding a focal lesion can be seen. What is the most likely diagnosis?,SBA: Central Nervous and Head & Neck,Neurocysticercosis,Metastatic osteosarcoma,Metastatic chondroblastoma,Cryptococcus,Cytomegalovirus,A,86%,7%,4%,2%,1%,"Explanation:
Neurocysticercosis
Cysticercosis is caused by a tapeworm native to low income countries and carried by pigs. Cysts calcify over time. In the skeletal muscle these can be seen on plain radiographs as ‘rice grain’ calcifications. CNS infection with cysticercosis is termed neurocysticercosis and is well described in the literature.
  Cytomegalovirus – this is a neonatal infection or one of the immunocompromised. Periventricular cysts and calcifications develop.
  Cryptococcus
This is an opportunistic yeast-like fungus which therefore requires a degree of immunocompromise, typically AIDS. The cryptococcomas are non-enhancing low density lesions in the basal ganglia. A granulomatous meningitis can also occur. They can be differentiated from VR spaces on FLAIR where VR spaces will suppress (being CSF in content) whereas the mucoid cryptococcomas will not.
  Metastatic chondrosarcoma or osteosarcoma – Metastases from osteosarcomas can show calcification (this can present as a pneumothorax secondary to lung metastases). Chondrosarcomas are cartilaginous forming tumours although rings and arcs of calcification are a feature.",TRUE,Neurocysticercosis is the most likely diagnosis because it is the most common cause of focal neurologic deficits in patients from Mexico. The calcified structures in the soft tissues surrounding the hip and the oedema surrounding the focal lesion on MRI are both signs of neurocysticercosis.,2,,A,TRUE,"I chose option 1, Neurocysticercosis, because the patient's presentation and imaging findings are consistent with this diagnosis. Neurocysticercosis is a parasitic infection of the central nervous system caused by the larval stage of the pork tapeworm, Taenia solium. It is more common in areas with poor sanitation and in people who have traveled to or are from endemic regions, such as Mexico.

The patient's focal neurology and the presence of edema surrounding a focal lesion on MRI scanning of his head suggest an intracranial process. The tiny calcified structures in the soft tissues surrounding his hip also point towards a systemic parasitic infection. These calcifications are often seen in cysticercosis, as the larvae form cysts in various tissues, which can later calcify.

The other options are less likely based on the provided information:
2. Metastatic osteosarcoma: This is a type of bone cancer that typically affects younger individuals and would not typically present with focal neurology and calcified structures in soft tissues.
3. Metastatic chondroblastoma: This is a rare benign bone tumor, and the presentation does not match the patient's symptoms and findings.
4. Cryptococcus: This is a fungal infection that can affect the central nervous system, but it does not typically cause calcified structures in soft tissues.
5. Cytomegalovirus: This is a viral infection that can cause various symptoms, but the imaging findings and presentation do not align with a CMV infection.",A,TRUE,A

Two weeks later he receives an MRI scan through his team’s medical care plan as he still has ongoing pain. The radiologist reports high signal on STIR sequences at the anterolateral femoral condyle as well as the medial facet of the patella. The medial patella retinaculum is also torn. What is the most likely diagnosis?",SBA: Musculoskeletal and Trauma,Transient patella dislocation,Pivot shift injury,Hyperextension injury,Clip injury,O’Donoghue triad,A,91%,3%,2%,2%,2%,"Explanation:
Bony contusions
Bruising to the bone can be detected around 2 days following an injury but may not resolve for many months thereafter. With regards knee injuries, it is often possible to discern the mechanism of injury from the pattern of bruising seen. The contusions follow fluid on MRI scans i.e. low in signal on T1 and high on T2 (and STIR). STIR is used to suppress the fat of the bone marrow thereby making the fluid stand out more.
  Transient lateral patella dislocation injury
When the patella dislocates laterally, its medial facet can impact onto the anterolateral corner of the lateral femoral condyle. Both areas become damaged and contusions can be seen on MRI. Often though, the patella reduces spontaneously and thus the exact mechanism of injury must be inferred from the imaging findings.
Joint effusion
Osteochondral injuries to the anterolateral femoral condyle and medial patella facet
Sprain or disruption to the medial retinaculum
  Hyperextension injury
These occur often following excessively forceful kicking. There will be bony contusions at the anterior aspect of the tibial plateau and femoral condyles. Either of the anterior or posterior cruciate ligaments may also be involved.
  Clip injury and pivot shift injury
These two injuries are very similar. Both involve valgus stress on a flexed knee (such as a tackle to the knee during sports). A pivot shift injury also requires external rotation of the tibia. The three main structures most at risk during these injuries are:
Anterior cruciate ligament (especially in a pivot shift injury)
Medial collateral ligament (especially in a clip injury)
Medial meniscus (remember that the medial meniscus is attached to the medial collateral ligament)
If all three are present together it is referred to as the O’Donoghue triad. Since O’Donoghue defined this triad however, it has been discovered that lateral meniscal tears are actually more common with this type of injury than medial meniscus ones.
Bony contusions occur at the side of impact because the proximal tibia and distal femur impact on one another thus:

On examination your A+E colleague notes mucocutaneous pigmentation in addition to generalised abdominal tenderness. He undergoes a small bowel follow through on which an ileo-ileal intussusception is diagnosed. There are multiple filling defects in the small bowel. What is the unifying diagnosis?,SBA: Gastrointestinal,Peutz-Jegher syndrome,Turcot syndrome,Cowden syndrome,Gardner syndrome,Familial Adenomatous Polyposis,A,92%,1%,2%,2%,3%,"Explanation:
Polyposis syndromes – intussusception is a significant risk
  Peutz-Jegher syndrome
Around half of cases are inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion but the rest are sporadic mutations to a tumour-suppressing gene on chromosome 11.  Innumerable hamartomatous polyps develop throughout the gastrointestinal tract. For a firm diagnosis there should be at least 100 polyps but usually there are far more. In the large bowel the polyps can be larger and more pedunculated, putting the patient at risk of intussusceptions. Patients are also at greater risk of many different cancers (upper GI, ovary, thyroid, testis, pancreas, breast). Mucocutaneous pigmentation is classic.
  Turcot syndrome
This is a subtype of Familial Adenomatous Polyposis (FAP) and inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion. The polyps are adenomatous and largely colonic. They are subject to the adenoma-carcinoma sequence and thus most patients develop cancer before the reach 40 years of age. Brain tumours are also part of this disease; supratentorial glioblastomas or medulloblastomas. A patient with diarrhoea and seizures would be a typical scenario in which Turcot syndrome is diagnosed.
  Cowden syndrome
This is a rare hamartomatous syndrome which is inherited as an autosomal dominant defect on chromosome 10. The polyps are predominantly (but not exclusively) in the rectosigmoid colon. There is an association with fibrocystic disease and fibroadenomas of the breast; around half of patients have breast pathology. There is a specific association with dysplastic cerebellar gangliocytoma also known as Lhermitte-Duclos disease. Patients with Cowden syndrome also develop skin lesions on the head and face called trichilemmomas which resemble tiny basal cell carcinomas.
  Gardner syndrome
This is a subtype of Familial Adenomatous Polyposis (FAP) and is a triad of colonic polyps, osteomas of the membranous skeleton (skull, maxilla, mandible) and soft tissue tumours such as desmoid tumours of the mesentery, lipomas, fibromas, keloid scarring. Many patients have supernummary teeth and dental caries requiring significant dental work at an early age.
  Familial Adenomatous Polyposis (FAP)
The polyps in FAP are said to resemble a carpet since they are so numerous. There are invariably colonic adenomatous polyps and around half of patients have stomach hamartomas too and a quarter of patients have duodenal adenomas. Patients usually undergo a prophylactic total colectomy and thereafter the greatest risk is of a periampullary carcinoma.

 ",FALSE,"Familial Adenomatous Polyposis (FAP) is a genetic disorder characterized by the formation of numerous polyps in the large intestine. It is the most common cause of ileo-ileal intussusception, which is a condition in which one part of the intestine slides into another.

Therefore, the unifying diagnosis is Familial Adenomatous Polyposis.",2,,E,TRUE,"I chose Peutz-Jegher syndrome as the unifying diagnosis because the presented symptoms and findings align with the classic features of this condition. Peutz-Jegher syndrome is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder characterized by the development of noncancerous growths called hamartomatous polyps in the gastrointestinal tract, particularly in the small intestine, which can lead to intussusception, as mentioned in the case.

  Vascular malformations
There have, historically, been a few different classification systems used to organise vascular anomalies. The most straightforward of these is detailed below.
  Image © Medical Exam Prep
  Orbital cavernous haemangiomas
These are slow growing, solid vascular masses, similar in nature to other cavernous haemangiomata around the rest of the body. They enhance with contrast and dynamic contrast sequences, if performed, can show the usual gradual 'filling in' phenomenon. Orbital haemangiomas will displace surrounding structures, rather than invading them and pressure effects on adjacent bone can lead to remodelling. On T1 weighted images a dark pseudocapsule may be seen but otherwise the lesion will be isointense to muscle. On T2 weighted images haemangiomas are high in signal.",FALSE,"I chose number 5, Filling-in phenomenon, because an orbital haemangioma does not cause a filling-in phenomenon.

11901,201667,An adolescent boy suffers a seizure midway through a test at school. He undergoes an MRI scan which shows a mass in the periphery of his right temporal lobe. There are a number of cysts but the lesion causes no oedema and displays no enhancement. What is the diagnosis?,SBA: Paediatrics,DNET,Schizencephaly,Ganglioglioma,PNET,Astrocytoma,A,65%,2%,13%,14%,5%,"Explanation:
A DNET (Dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumour) should be relatively simple diagnosis to make on paper. The patient will be youngish, with a temporal lobe lesion (in fact approximately a third are frontal lobe lesions), a history of epilepsy (often refractory) and the lesion is described as bubbly – here given as multiple cysts. The lack of oedema or enhancement is also typical.
Gangliogliomas are known to cause refractory temporal seizures, temporal lobe epilepsy in particular.  The usually enhance and also have a cystic component but these tumours can also show no enhancement post contrast. (Lack of enhancement is a feature much more classical to DNET though.) Furthermore although gangliogliomas can be cystic, the description of multiple cysts given in the question plays into the ‘bubbly’ texture of DNETs which is the usual description proffered.
Schizencephaly is a congenital abnormality consisting of a cleft extending from the ventricles to the subarachnoid space.
A PNET (primitive neuroectoderm tumour) shares little with a DNET besides the similarity in their acronyms. The age range for PNET is quoted as <5 years. They can show cystic features but the other features described are far more classical for DNET.
The term PNET is historical as these tumours are now described as Embryonal Tumours with Multilayered Rosettes (ETMR). 
Astrocytomas are the most common brain tumour in children. Although they also do not show significant oedema or enhancement they are usually located in the posterior fossa.",TRUE,"DNET stands for Dysembryoplastic Neuroepithelial Tumor, which is a type of tumor that is commonly found in the temporal lobe. It is characterized by cysts and lesions that typically do not cause oedema or display enhancement on an MRI scan.

Disseminated pneumocystis causes cortical necrosis and calcification, similar to disseminated MAI. The other conditions are associated with medullary nephrocalcinosis. Incidentally, medullary nephrocalcinosis is 20 times more common than cortical nephrocalcinosis.
The most common cause of nephrocalcinosis is hyperparathyroidism (followed closely by renal tubular acidosis).

On examination he has pitting oedema to his feet, a heart murmur on auscultation and distension of his neck veins. A CXR shows bilateral pleural effusions. The A&E doctor is worried he might have an aortic dissection, so he undergoes a CT scan. This shows, among other things, flattening of the right ventricle with curvature of the interventricular septum to the left. What is the diagnosis?",SBA: Cardiothoracic and vascular,Pericarditis,Aortic dissection type A,Aortic dissection type B,Lobar pulmonary emboli,Aortic coarctation,A,62%,7%,1%,27%,4%,"Explanation:
Pericarditis
Inflammation of the pericardium is termed pericarditis and leads to fibrous thickening. Most commonly this occurs either post-operatively in patients undergoing cardiac surgery or as an idiopathic entity although historically it was tuberculosis which was the most common cause of pericarditis. The diagnosis is predominantly clinical with symptoms such as malaise or dyspnoea and signs such as neck vein distension or paradoxical movement of the JVP. On cross sectional imaging thickening of the pericardium to greater than 2mm can be seen and the fibrosis causes a restriction in distensibility. The right ventricle, being more compliant than the left, becomes flattened and furthermore there can be curvature of the septum towards the left. Elsewhere, if the field of view permits, accessory signs such as pleural effusions and even ascites may be seen.
  Pulmonary Emboli
There is some cross-over of the signs and symptoms of pericarditis and a large lobar embolus. On CT, if the embolus is large enough to cause right ventricular strain the septum can sometimes appear bowed with reflux of IV contrast into the hepatic veins.
  Aortic dissection
Dissections are classified according to their involvement of the aortic root and their distal extent. There are two different classification systems. The Stanford classification is more useful clinically since the primary decision post-diagnosis is whether the dissection will be managed surgically or medically. Those involving the proximal aorta and arch are managed surgically. If the arch is not involved, the patient can be managed medically. Thus Stanford A dissections involve the aorta proximal to the origin of the left subclavian artery with or without concurrent distal involvement. Stanford B dissections do not involve the proximal aorta. Where a dissection extends proximally and causes pericardial tamponade the clinical signs and symptoms may well occur, however the presence of effusions and pitting oedema do not fit with the correct answer being aortic dissection.
  Coarctation
A congenital narrowing of the aorta at the level of the ductus arteriosus is known as coarctation. This can present neonatally when the point of stenosis is preductal. This means the body and lower limbs are supplied primarily via a patent ductus arteriosus. When coarctation presents later, even in adulthood, the point of stenosis is usually post-ductal with established collateralization via the subclavian and intercostals arteries. It is this collateral pathway which gives rise to the rib notching seen on a CXR.
Rib notching is due to chronic bony remodeling and it takes until around the age of 20 for it to become radiologically evident. Of note the intercostals arteries to the first and second ribs arise from the costocervical trunk and therefore the first and second ribs do not show rib notching. Furthermore should the patient have an aberrant right subclavian artery (ARSCA) as well as coarctation they will only demonstrate rib notching on the left side since the ARSCA originates distal to the stenotic point.
The other specific CXR sign associated with coarctation is the ‘figure of 3’ sign which refers to the contour of the descending aorta.
Coarctation of the aorta, like most of the other congenital cardiovascular abnormalities, has the usual sprinkling of associations. At least half of patients have a bicuspid aortic valve. As well as PDAs, VSDs are also common. There is a particular association with Turner syndrome (45, XO) (which often features in medical school finals questions.)",FALSE,"I chose this option because the symptoms and findings described in the question are consistent with aortic dissection type A. The patient has pitting oedema in his feet, a heart murmur on auscultation, distension of neck veins, and a CT scan that shows flattening of the right ventricle with curvature of the interventricular septum to the left. These findings are all consistent with aortic dissection type A.",2,,B,FALSE,"I chose option 3, Lobar pulmonary emboli, because the patient's symptoms and CT scan findings are consistent with this diagnosis. 

Dyspnea, general malaise, pitting edema, and bilateral pleural effusions are all indicative of a possible pulmonary embolism, as it can cause increased pressure in the pulmonary circulation, leading to fluid accumulation and edema. Additionally, the CT scan finding of flattening of the right ventricle with curvature of the interventricular septum to the left is a sign of right ventricular strain, which is commonly seen in cases of significant pulmonary embolism. This is due to the increased pressure in the pulmonary arteries causing the right side of the heart to work harder to pump blood through the lungs.

The other options are less likely based on the given information:

1. Aortic dissection type A: This would typically present with severe chest pain and may have a widened mediastinum on CXR. The CT scan findings mentioned do not support this diagnosis.

2. Aortic dissection type B: Similar to type A, this would present with chest or back pain and may have a widened mediastinum on CXR. The CT scan findings mentioned do not support this diagnosis.

4. Pericarditis: This condition would typically present with chest pain that is relieved by sitting up and leaning forward, and there may be a pericardial friction rub on auscultation. The CT scan findings mentioned do not support this diagnosis.

5. Aortic coarctation: This is a congenital condition and would have likely presented earlier in life with symptoms related to hypertension or decreased blood flow to the lower extremities. The CT scan findings mentioned do not support this diagnosis.",D,FALSE,D

What is the most likely diagnosis?","SBA: Genito urinary, Adrenal, Obstetrics & Gynaecology and Breast",Remnant cyst,Seminal vesicle cyst,Cystic prostate cancer,Mullerian duct cyst,Prostatic utricle cyst,A,95%,0%,0%,3%,1%,"Explanation:
Anatomy plays a strong role in the correct diagnosis of male genitourinary tract cysts. It is first necessary to differentiate between intraprostatic cysts and extraprostatic cysts.
  Urachal cyst (extraprostatic)
The urachus is a fibrous remnant of a thin canal connecting the bladder to the umbilicus. Ordinarily it is almost imperceptible however there are four distinct anomalies which can persist into adulthood and cause symptoms.
Patency – a fistula between the bladder and the umbilicus. There is leakage of urine from the umbilicus present from birth.
Sinus – blind dilatation of the urachus at the umbilical end.
Diverticulum – communication with the dome of the bladder
Cyst – dilatation in the lower third which does not communicate with either end. These are asymptomatic unless or until the cyst becomes infected or ruptures.
Malignancy arising from the urachas, unlike most bladder cancer, tends to be adenocarcinoma. In young patients sarcomas are also seen.
  Mullerian duct cyst (intraprostatic)
These are usually found in young adult men and are also caused by incomplete regression of the Mullerian duct. They have numerous similarities with prostatic utricle cysts, although the latter is associated with other congenital anomalies whereas Mullerian duct cysts are, classically, not. Anatomically they are also posterior to the bladder however unlike prostatic utricle cysts they extend superiorly to the prostate and do not communicate with the urethra. On MRI they appear straightforwardly cystic unless complicated by infection. The shape of the cyst is said to be teardrop shaped rather than the pear shaped prostatic utricle cysts.

  Prostatic utricle cyst (intraprostatic)
These are found in teenagers or adolescents and represent incomplete regression of the Mullerian duct system during embryological development. They are found posterior to the bladder, within the prostate, and do not extend any more superiorly than the superior most aspect of the prostate. This anatomical detail and the fact that the cyst does communicate with the prostatic urethra sets it apart from a Mullerian duct cyst on imaging. They can cause all manner of lower urinary tract symptoms and boast an association with ipsilateral renal agenesis as well as intersex disorders. On MRI they are said to have a pear shaped appearance.
  Seminal vesicle cyst (extraprostatic)
Seminal vesicle cysts form due to stenosis or atresia of the ejaculatory ducts and can be post-infective in nature or congenital. They tend to present in adolescence due to the increase in secretions around this time. Acquired cysts are seen later on in life. The signal characteristics on MRI are variable depending on the presence or absence of haemorrhage. Anatomically it should be easy to pinpoint their location as relating to the seminal vesicles, namely posterior to the bladder and superior to the prostate. Congenital seminal vesicle cysts are associated with renal anomalies and adult polycystic kidney disease.
  Cystic prostate cancer
Carcinoma of the prostate does not usually present as a cystic mass but the presence of haemorrhage within a cystic mass should raise the possibility of malignancy. Most prostate cancer arises from the peripheral zone and is seen as low T2 signal with restriction of diffusion. Cystic prostate cancer will return high signal on T2. The main differential diagnosis is a prostatic abscess.",TRUE,"I chose this answer because a remnant cyst is the most common type of cyst found in the anterior abdominal wall, and it is often associated with umbilical piercings. It is typically filled with a thin watery fluid, which matches the patient's symptoms. In addition, it is a benign cyst, so it does not pose a risk of cancer.",2,,D,TRUE,"I chose option 5, a remnant cyst, because the patient's presentation and ultrasound findings are consistent with this diagnosis. The patient has a thin watery discharge coming from his umbilicus, which suggests a connection between the umbilicus and the fluid-filled structure seen on ultrasound. This points to a remnant of the embryonic development, such as an urachal cyst or sinus, rather than an issue with the reproductive system (options 1-4).

Urachal remnants are relatively rare but can occur when a portion of the embryonic urachus fails to close completely during development. This can result in a fluid-filled structure, such as a cyst or sinus, that may be connected to the umbilicus. In this case, the patient's recent naval piercing could have potentially irritated or introduced an infection to the area, leading to his current symptoms.",A,FALSE,B

Vertebral haemangioma
These lesions are extremely common and should be very familiar to all candidates. They can occur anywhere but commonly arise in the vertebrae. They have a typical appearance of vertical trabeculae which give a ‘corduroy’ appearance when viewed in sagittal or coronal planes but a honeycomb or polka-dot appearance when viewed in the axial plane. On MRI they return high signal on both T1 and T2 sequences.
  Metastatic malignant melanoma
This is the exception that proves the rule. Apart from metastatic malignant melanoma, all other skeletal lesions which return high signal on T1 are benign. The melanin pigment has paramagnetic effects and leads to high T1 signal. On top of this melanoma metastases have a high propensity to haemorrhage which can also produce high T1 signals.

13793,201667,A 73-year-old lady with a presentation of progressive memory loss undergoes an 18F-FDG PET study. It demonstrates decreased uptake in the lateral occipital cortex with preservation of the mid-posterior cingulate gyrus. Which is the most likely diagnosis?,SBA: Central Nervous and Head & Neck,Lewy Body Dementia,Alzheimer's disease,Parkinson's disease,Pick's disease,Huntington's disease,A,76%,11%,4%,6%,3%,"Explanation:
These findings are classical for Lewy Body dementia, with the Cingulate Island Sign being described. Alzheimer's disease causes low posterior temporoparietal cortical activity, which is similar to Parkinson’s disease. Pick's disease affects the frontotemporal region. Hungtington’s causes low activity in the caudate nucleus head and putamen.
  Lewy body dementia
A core clinical feature to this dementia is the fluctuant nature of the symptoms. Parkinsonian features can also develop although these are usually subsequent to the memory decline. Visual hallucinations are also a feature. Radiologically there is a generalised decrease in cerebral volume (sparing the hippocampi). Temporo-parietal hypoperfusion on HMPAO Tc99m SPECT scanning is indicative of Lewy body dementia. Involvement of the occipital cortex, which is typically spared in Alzheimers disease, sets the two apart from one another on PET studies.",FALSE,"Answer: 2. Alzheimer's disease. The decreased uptake in the lateral occipital cortex with preservation of the mid-posterior cingulate gyrus is a common imaging finding associated with Alzheimer's disease. This pattern of decreased uptake is thought to be due to the presence of amyloid plaques in the brain, which are a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease.",2,,B,TRUE,"I chose option 1, Lewy Body Dementia, because the 18F-FDG PET study findings described in the question are consistent with this condition. The decreased uptake in the lateral occipital cortex with preservation of the mid-posterior cingulate gyrus is a characteristic pattern seen in Lewy Body Dementia. In contrast, the other conditions listed typically have different patterns of uptake on PET scans. For example, Alzheimer's disease usually shows decreased uptake in the temporal and parietal lobes, while Parkinson's disease and Huntington's disease primarily affect other brain regions. Pick's disease, also known as frontotemporal dementia, typically presents with decreased uptake in the frontal and/or temporal lobes.",A,TRUE,A
14224,201667,You are reviewing the chest radiograph of a 3-year-old girl. There is increased intrathoracic volume in the left chest with flattening of the hemidiaphragm. No foreign body is seen. What is the most likely diagnosis? Select ONE answer only.,SBA: Paediatrics,Inhaled foreign body,CPAM,Congenital lobar emphysema,Swyer-James syndrome,Extralobar sequestration,A,65%,3%,25%,6%,1%,"Explanation:
Inhaled foreign body
This is an important differential diagnosis to consider in paediatrics, particularly in younger mobile children in whom an accurate history may not be forthcoming. Not all foreign bodies are radio-opaque. Inhaled foreign bodies are slightly more likely to enter the right main bronchus than the left owing to its straighter course but left sided foreign bodies are by no means unheard of. Usually an inhaled foreign body will cause a ball-valve mechanism on the affected side leading to air-trapping and over-inflation. This gives rise to the CXR features described in the vignette. It is worth noting that the chest x-ray can also be normal in around a third of cases.
  Congenital Pulmonary Airway Malformation (CPAM) – also known as Congenital cystic adenomatoid malformation (CCAM)
Although often an antenatal diagnosis, CPAM should be considered in the investigation of a neonatal respiratory distress. Milder cases can present later when the child develops a LRTI and decompensates. On investigation a cystic mass is discovered. The malformation can exert a mass effect, causing both hypoplasia of the remainder of the ipsilateral lung as well as contralateral mediastinal shift.
  Congenital lobar over-inflation (previously congenital lobar emphysema)
It is usually the left upper lobe which is affected but approximately 40% of cases involve the left upper lobe; the right middle or the right upper lobes are affected in a further 55% of cases. There is a reasonable male preponderance of approximately 3:1.
On a CXR there is hyperlucency of the affected lobe and often mass effect on the mediastinum leading to contralateral mediastinal shift and thereby respiratory distress.
  Swyer-James syndrome
In this condition, normal development of the infant lung is impeded by bronchiolitis (viral or mycoplasma) at an early age, with superadded acute airspace destruction. Consequently, the affected lobe is small and lucent on the CXR due to air trapping. In an exam situation Swyer-James syndrome is usually given as a teenage or young adult patient with a history of recurrent LRTIs. Air trapping, and bronchiectasis can also be described.
  Pulmonary sequestration
Intralobar sequestration– This is more common (75%) but less severe. The affected segment does not have its own pleura and drains, like normal, via the pulmonary veins. Presents as recurrent pneumonias and is seen on a CXR as cysts with fluid levels. Some are associated with other congenital abnormalities but a larger proportion develop in isolation.
Extralobar sequestration– This is less common (25%) and more severe with around half of patients suffering from other additional congenital anomalies. Venous drainage is via the systemic circulation and patients present in childhood either with respiratory distress due to shunting of blood or with symptoms attributed to the associated congenital anomalies (e.g. diaphragmatic hernia). The segment has its own pleura and therefore collateral air drift via the pores of Kohn cannot occur. The lack of aeration helps differentiate it from intralobar sequestration. Seen on a CXR as an opacity adjacent to the heart, abutting the diaphragm.",FALSE,"Congenital lobar emphysema is the most likely diagnosis because it is the most common cause of increased intrathoracic volume in the left chest with flattening of the hemidiaphragm in a 3-year-old girl. This condition is caused by a blockage of the bronchus that leads to the affected lobe, causing the air to become trapped and the lobe to become enlarged. Other causes, such as CPAM, inhaled foreign body, and extralobar sequestration, are less likely in this case. Swyer-James syndrome is caused by recurrent episodes of bronchiolitis and is more common in older children.",2,,C,FALSE,"I chose option 2, congenital lobar emphysema, because the clinical presentation described in the question is consistent with this condition. Congenital lobar emphysema is a rare lung abnormality characterized by overinflation of one or more lobes of the lung. This overinflation can lead to increased intrathoracic volume and flattening of the hemidiaphragm, as mentioned in the question. Additionally, the absence of a foreign body and the patient's young age (3 years old) further support this diagnosis. The other options are less likely given the information provided.",C,TRUE,A
14570,201667,A 52-year-old man complains of a painful lump in his left foot. He undergoes an MRI scan which shows a 32mm lesion which you suspect to be a Morton neuroma. What are most likely signal characteristics of this lesion? Select ONE answer only.,SBA: Musculoskeletal and Trauma,"Low signal on T1, T2 and STIR","Low signal on T1 and T2, high signal on STIR","High signal on T1, low signal on T2 and STIR","Low signal on T1, high signal on T2 and STIR","High signal on T1, T2 and STIR",A,69%,11%,4%,14%,2%,"Explanation:
Morton neuroma
Fibrosis surrounding a plantar digital nerve leads to a hard lump developing in the sole of the foot. Patients complain of a painful lump which feels a bit like walking on a hot lump of gravel. On an MRI scan they are often slightly disguised by their low or isointensity to muscle on T1 weighted sequences and hypointensity on T2 weighted sequences. Curiously for a fibrotic process, they do usually enhance with gadolinium. On ultrasound the classic appearance of a hypoechoic mass situated between but slightly proximal to the metatarsal heads should be sufficient to make the diagnosis. Most are found in the third metatarsal space. The Mulder sign can be performed clinically or with ultrasound and involves eliciting pain and a clicking sound when the metatarsal heads are squeezed together while applying pressure on the dorsum of the foot over the neuroma, or scanning the sole of the foot.
It is said that Morton neuromas are larger and easier to visualise with MRI when the patient is prone, i.e. the foot is slightly plantar-flexed. On ultrasound this translates to a straightforward prone position or one where the patient is sitting on the side of the couch with their feet slightly plantar flexed. One theory is that any physical tension through the metatarsal joints (more likely on supine positioning) causes the neuroma to be pulled up in-between the metatarsal heads.",FALSE,"I chose this answer because Morton neuromas are typically characterized by low signal on T1 and high signal on T2 and STIR. This is because they are typically composed of fibrous tissue and tend to have a higher water content, which results in a higher signal on T2 and STIR.",1,"3. A question about the application of knowledge, how to interpret the results?

3. A question about the application of knowledge, how to interpret the results?",D,FALSE,"I chose option 2 (Low signal on T1 and T2, high signal on STIR) because Morton neuroma typically presents with these signal characteristics on MRI. 

Morton neuroma is a benign, fibrous tissue thickening around a nerve, usually between the third and fourth metatarsal heads in the foot. On MRI, it commonly exhibits the following signal characteristics:

- Low signal intensity on T1-weighted images: This is because the lesion primarily consists of fibrous tissue, which appears hypointense (dark) on T1-weighted images.
- Low signal intensity on T2-weighted images: Although fluid and edema typically show high signal intensity on T2-weighted images, the fibrous nature of Morton neuroma causes it to appear hypointense (dark) on T2-weighted images as well.
- High signal intensity on STIR (Short Tau Inversion Recovery) images: STIR is a fat-suppression sequence that highlights fluid and edema. Despite the fibrous nature of Morton neuroma, there may be some surrounding edema or inflammation, which would appear hyperintense (bright) on STIR images.

These signal characteristics help differentiate Morton neuroma from other potential causes of foot pain and masses.",B,TRUE,A
11196,201667,A 50-year-old woman with a history of previous breast reduction surgery presents for a screening mammogram under the NHS breast screening programme. This shows a lesion in the RUO quadrant which has a stellate appearance and shows central lucency. What is the most likely diagnosis?,"SBA: Genito urinary, Adrenal, Obstetrics & Gynaecology and Breast",Radial scar,Carcinoma,Phyllodes tumour,Fibroadenoma,Galactocoele,A,83%,8%,4%,2%,3%,"Explanation:
Radial scar
This used to be the classic description of a radial scar in a patient with prior breast surgery. Actually there is no association with prior surgery. Around half are associated with a carcinoma and hence management is usually surgical excision.
A carcinoma would typically be described as an area of architectural distortion, or a stellate mass.
  Fibroadenoma
Popcorn calcification is pathognomonic of a fibroadenoma. They tend to be nodular or lobulated in contour but with smooth margins. They often show a ‘halo’ sign of low attenuation where tissue surrounding the lesion has been compressed.
  A phyllodes tumour
These would typically be described as having a similar appearance to a fibroadenoma. Occasionally they can demonstrate a ‘halo’ sign.
  Galactocoele
A galactocoele appears during lactation as an enlarging painless mass. A fat-fluid level is a specific finding on a lateral view. These lesions would be far more likely to be ultrasound diagnoses than mammographic.
  Carcinoma
On ultrasound malignant lesions usually appear as an indistinct hypoechoic firm mass. On mammography they can have a variety of appearances including spiculation and association with microcalcification but central lucency is not a feature of malignancy.",TRUE,"Radial scar is the most likely diagnosis because it is a benign breast lesion that typically presents as a stellate shaped lesion with central lucency on mammography. Radial scars can occur in any age group, but are most commonly seen in women over the age of 40.",2,,C,TRUE,"I chose option 3, Radial scar, because the description of the lesion in the question matches the typical appearance of a radial scar.

  IPF (Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis) can only be diagnosed in the absence of a precipitating condition such as asbestosis, rheumatoid arthritis, or drug toxicity. Where such exists, the condition is termed UIP (Usual interstitial pneumonia). CFA (Crytpogenic fibrosing alveolitis) is a historic term for the same thing.
There is much overlap in the features of the various different fibrotic lung diseases.
Therefore, look for specific features which are most strongly associated with the different conditions. The table below (despite appearances) simplifies the overall situation significantly and is inadequate for real life radiology but does provide a framework on which to build further understanding of these conditions.

Which of the following is most susceptible to avascular necrosis?,SBA: Musculoskeletal and Trauma,Navicular,Calcaneum,Talus,Lumbar vertebra,Thoracic vertebra,A,62%,14%,22%,1%,1%,"Explanation:
Arguably the other bones listed may all be at greater risk of fracture during this kind of injury however it is the navicular which is most susceptible to avascular necrosis thereafter. Of note, the navicular is the last bone in the foot to ossify.
The navicular is particularly at risk of injury since it experiences stress at three different points, anteriorly by the first and second metatarsals (via the cuneiforms) and, at a point between them but posteriorly, from the talus. This fulcrum effect leaves it very susceptible to fracturing through its middle portion. In an unhappy coincidence the navicular receives its blood supply from two different sources and these anastomose in the same middle portion leaving it vulnerable to avascular necrosis in the case of a fracture.
Idiopathic avascular necrosis of the navicular in young children (4-6 years) is termed Kohler disease. The equivalent process in adults is called Mueller Weiss syndrome.",FALSE,The calcaneum is the most susceptible to avascular necrosis because it is the most commonly affected bone in the foot due to its limited blood supply. This limited blood supply makes it more vulnerable to fracture and subsequent avascular necrosis.,1,"This question falls under category 2: A question about clinical judgement, what is the correct diagnosis?",B,FALSE,"I chose option 3, the talus, because it is the most susceptible to avascular necrosis among the given options. Avascular necrosis, also known as osteonecrosis, is a condition where the bone tissue dies due to a lack of blood supply. The talus is particularly vulnerable to this condition because it has a limited blood supply compared to other bones, and any disruption to its blood supply can lead to avascular necrosis. In the case of the patient who landed directly on his feet during a parachute jump, the impact could have potentially damaged the blood vessels supplying the talus, increasing the risk of avascular necrosis.",C,FALSE,C

8881,201667,A 62-year-old lady complains to her GP of tenesmus. On examination there is a palpable mass but subsequent proctoscopy is normal. She undergoes an MRI which shows a 6cm mass posterior to the rectum which is of low signal on T1 and returns high signal on T2. On closer inspection it is contained within the mesorectum. Which of the following would best fit with these findings?,SBA: Gastrointestinal,Tailgut cyst,Rectal cancer,Tarlov cyst,Diverticular disease,Cystocoele,A,87%,3%,5%,1%,4%,"Explanation:
A tailgut duplication cyst (also known as retrorectal cystic hamartoma)
Curiously these occur almost exclusively in women. Anatomically they sit within the presacral or retrorectal fat. They tend to be an incidental diagnosis and can be associated with bony defects within the sacrum. An uncomplicated cyst will return low signal on T1 and high signal on T2 but often they contain mucein whereupon they appear characteristically high in signal on T1 weighted MRI sequences. They can be surprisingly large and are often multiloculated.
  A Tarlov cyst
A tarlov cyst is the name given to dilatation of the posterior nerve root sheath. They follow CSF on all sequences and can cause significant bony scalloping.
  Rectal cancer MRI
The muscularis propria is the outer wall of the rectum and shows up as low signal on T2 weighted sequences. 
Since the rectum (like the oesophagus) does not have a serosa, once spread beyond the muscularis propria into the mesorectal fat has occurred (ie a T3 tumour), nodal involvement is also feasible. The mesorectal fascia is a thin plane of connective tissue which contains fat, the rectum, local lymph nodes as a distinct anatomical entity and is of paramount importance in rectal cancer management. Spread beyond the mesorectal fascia denotes a T4 tumour. MRI is excellent for local staging of rectal cancer because the mesorectal fascia is seen clearly as a thin black line on T2 weighted sequences and its involvement or lack thereof can be readily discerned. In contrast, the tumour appears as intermediate signal on T2, distorting the normal anatomy. The fascia is also referred to as the ‘CRM’ which stands for circumferential resection margin and relates to the surgical operation performed for rectal tumours, namely a total mesorectal excision (TME). The proximity of the tumour extent to the CRM is prognostically important; tumours with a >1mm margin before they reach the CRM are far less likely to recur. A <1mm margin is taken as involvement of the CRM.
  Cystocoele
A cystocoele is bulging of the bladder into the vagina. Also termed an anterior prolapse, the condition is common in elderly women and those who have undergone traumatic deliveries.
On imaging the bulge will obviously match the bladder on all sequences.
  Diverticular disease
Diverticulosis is the presence of multiple tiny outpouchings, within the colon. Technically these are false diverticuli since they do not involve all of the layers of the colonic wall. Diverticulitis occurs when one or more of these diverticuli becomes acutely inflamed and/or infected. Diverticular disease is the term used to collect together the sequela of multiple episodes of diverticulitis which may have resulted in abscess formation, stricturing and fistula formation.",FALSE,"I chose rectal cancer because it is the most likely diagnosis based on the described symptoms and findings. The presence of a palpable mass, a 6cm mass on MRI, and its location posterior to the rectum and within the mesorectum are all suggestive of rectal cancer.

The arterial supply to the colon is provided by the superior and inferior mesenteric arteries. The superior mesenteric artery arises from the abdominal aorta at the lower border of L1, 1 cm below the origin of the coeliac trunk. The inferior mesenteric artery arises from the abdominal aorta at the L3 vertebral level.
Generally speaking, structures embryologically derived from the midgut are supplied by the superior mesenteric artery (SMA) and structures embryologically derived from the hindgut are supplied by the inferior mesenteric artery (IMA).
The ascending colon is derived from the midgut and receives its arterial supply from two branches of the superior mesenteric artery:
Ileocolic artery
Right colic artery
  The transverse colon is derived from both the midgut and hindgut and receives its arterial supply from branches of both the superior and inferior mesenteric arteries:
Right colic artery (from the SMA)
Middle colic artery (from the SMA)
Left colic artery (from the IMA)
  The descending colon is derived from the hindgut and receives its arterial supply from a single branch of the inferior mesenteric artery:
Left colic artery

10736,201667,A 40-year-old athlete complains of left sided calf claudication. On Doppler ultrasound there is popliteal stenosis. He undergoes an MRA which shows low T1 signal and high T2 signal in the wall of the popliteal artery. What is the most likely diagnosis?,SBA: Cardiothoracic and vascular,Cystic adventitial degeneration,Popliteal artery entrapment syndrome,Buerger disease,Spinal cord stenosis,Popliteal artery chronic thrombosis,A,75%,16%,5%,0%,4%,"Explanation:
Popliteal artery entrapment syndrome (PAES)
This arises due to an anomalous insertion of the medial head of gastrocnemius which compresses the popliteal artery leading to symptoms of claudication, particularly on exertion, in an otherwise fit individual. Of note, management is surgical; surgical release has far better outcomes than endovascular stenting.
  Cystic adventitial degeneration
On MRI scanning, mucous cysts can be seen in the wall of the popliteal artery. These, like most cysts, show high T2 signal and the T1 signal can be variable depending on the quantity of mucin present. This disease has a strong male preponderance and particularly affects the popliteal artery. On MRI the signal can be variable on T1 depending on the protein content of the cyst but returns a high signal on T2.
  Spinal cord stenosis
The inclusion of this answer pertains to symptoms of neurogenic claudication which can arise in the context of spinal cord stenosis or disc pathology, typically of the lumbar spine. Sensory and/or motor deficit at the appropriate level is found on neurological examination.
  Buerger disease
This disease is strongly linked to smoking and manifests as a vasculitis of the smaller arteries. Arterial occlusion with the formation of corkscrew-shaped collaterals occurs initially in the small arteries of the hands and feet but becoming more proximal as the disease progresses.

 ",TRUE,"Cystic Adventitial Degeneration is a condition characterized by cystic dilatation of the adventitia of the popliteal artery, which is often associated with claudication and other symptoms of vascular insufficiency. On MRA, this condition is typically seen as a low T1 signal and high T2 signal in the wall of the popliteal artery, which is what the athlete in the question is experiencing.",2,,E,TRUE,"I chose option 1, Cystic adventitial degeneration, because the given information in the question supports this diagnosis. The patient is a 40-year-old athlete with left-sided calf claudication and popliteal stenosis found on Doppler ultrasound. The MRA findings of low T1 signal and high T2 signal in the wall of the popliteal artery are consistent with cystic adventitial degeneration.

Cystic adventitial degeneration is a rare vascular disorder that can cause intermittent claudication, particularly in young to middle-aged male patients who are physically active. It is characterized by the development of mucinous cysts within the adventitial layer of the arterial wall, leading to compression and stenosis of the affected artery. In this case, the popliteal artery is affected, which is the most common site for this condition.

The other options are less likely given the patient's presentation and imaging findings:

2. Popliteal artery entrapment syndrome typically presents with similar symptoms, but the MRA findings would likely show compression or displacement of the popliteal artery by surrounding muscles or tendons rather than changes within the arterial wall itself.

3. Buerger disease (Thromboangiitis obliterans) is a rare inflammatory condition affecting small and medium-sized arteries and veins, typically in young male smokers. The MRA findings would likely show segmental occlusions and ""corkscrew"" collateral vessels, which are not mentioned in the question.

4. Spinal cord stenosis is not related to the popliteal artery or calf claudication and would not explain the MRA findings in this case.

5. Popliteal artery chronic thrombosis would likely show filling defects within the arterial lumen on MRA, rather than changes in the arterial wall signal intensities.",A,TRUE,A

Select ONE answer only.,SBA: Musculoskeletal and Trauma,Sprengel shoulder,Klippel-Feil syndrome,Ankylosing spondylitis,Rheumatoid arthritis,Post-operative,A,53%,5%,8%,27%,7%,"Explanation:
There is a differential diagnosis for block vertebra and although Sprengel shoulder features as a predominant part of Klippel-Feil syndrome, an isolated sprengel shoulder is not a cause of block vertebra.
Differential diagnosis for block vertebra:
Congenital
Klippel-Feil syndrome
Isolated
Arthritides
Rheumatoid arthritis
Ankylosing spondylitis
Miscellaneous
Post-operative
Post-traumatic fusion
Post-Tuberculosis infection
  Sprengel shoulder
This condition can occur in isolation as well as part of Klippel-Feil syndrome. It is (like Klippel-Feil syndrome) also often associated with renal anomalies. Sprengel shoulder is a congenital abnormality where the scapula (usually, but not exclusively, unilateral) is attached to the cervical vertebra either by a fibrous or osseous connection, and therefore fails to descend into the normal position. The result is elevation and medial rotation of the scapula, which is usually hypoplastic. The condition can be readily appreciated on a plain film although cross-sectional imaging is useful to plan surgical correction if required. If present, the osseous connection between the scapula and the spine is termed an omovertebral bar.
  Klippel-Feil syndrome (different from Klippel-Trenaunay-Weber syndrome: port-wine stains, localised hypertrophy and venous malformations)
Klippel-Feil syndrome is predominantly a segmentation anomaly which arises during foetal development and leads to cervical fusion of two or more vertebral bodies. C2-3 are most commonly involved, accounting for around half of cases. Thereafter C5-6 accounts for a further third and the remainder are made up from fusions at other levels. There are a multitude of associated features, the predominant ones of which include:
Renal abnormalities (of which a third have unilateral renal agenesis) - ⅔
Scoliosis >20o - ½
Sprengel shoulder - ⅓
Deafness (sensorineural) - ⅓
Cervical ribs - ⅕
  The renal anomalies seen include agenesis or dysgenesis, ectopic location, and duplication.
Yet further features of this condition, all present in under 20% of cases include:
Odontoid dysplasia
Hemivertebrae / butterfly vertebrae
Syringomyelia / diastomatomyelia

This question falls under category 1: Basic factual recall, either of basic science, physics, anatomy or regarding a procedure.",A,FALSE,"I chose Rheumatoid Arthritis as the answer because it is not a typical cause of block vertebrae. 

A block vertebra is a congenital condition where two or more adjacent vertebrae are fused together, resulting in reduced mobility and potential neurological symptoms. Here's a brief explanation of the other options:

1. Klippel-Feil Syndrome: This is a congenital disorder characterized by the fusion of two or more cervical vertebrae, making it a direct cause of block vertebrae.
2. Ankylosing Spondylitis: This is a chronic inflammatory disease that primarily affects the spine and sacroiliac joints, leading to progressive fusion of the vertebrae (ankylosis) and potentially causing block vertebrae.
4. Post-operative: Block vertebrae can be a result of surgical fusion of the spine, either intentionally (e.g., to treat instability) or as a complication.
5. Sprengel Shoulder: This is a congenital disorder where the scapula (shoulder blade) is abnormally high, often associated with Klippel-Feil Syndrome and block vertebrae.

Rheumatoid arthritis, on the other hand, is an autoimmune inflammatory disease that primarily affects the synovial joints. While it can cause joint destruction and deformity, it does not typically lead to the congenital fusion of vertebrae seen in block vertebrae.",D,FALSE,D
9391,201667,"A 32-year-old lady attends A+E having recently arrived back from a holiday in Jamaica. She complains that her ankles and calves are very swollen, she has abdominal pain and her liver function tests are deranged. An ultrasound scan shows ascites and hepatomegaly. The portal veins appear normal on B-mode but a Doppler study shows increased pulsatility. What is the diagnosis?",SBA: Gastrointestinal,Hepatic veno-occlusive disease,Acute Budd-Chiari syndrome,Primary biliary cirrhosis,Passive hepatic congestion,Viral hepatitis,A,47%,20%,1%,23%,10%,"Explanation:
Terminology
Budd-Chiari syndrome is hepatic venous occlusion by any cause. It can be subdivided into primary and secondary causes as follows:
Primary - endoluminal cause such as thrombosis, web or endophlebitis
Secondary - the obstructon is caused by something unrelated to the venous system such as tumour cells, abscess formation, cysts. Obstruction can be caused either by invasion or extrinsic compression.
  Hepatic venous outflow obstruction
There are three separate aetiologies which all overlap both in terms of their clinical and radiological features. They are, however, separate entities, caused by subtly different processes.
Passive hepatic congestion – this arises due to a cardiac problem such as right sided heart failure of any cause or constrictive pericarditis. Tender hepatomegaly is common and on imaging the hepatic veins and IVC are notably enlarged.
Hepatic vein obstruction – the pathology here is within the hepatic veins with thrombosis or other non-thrombotic obstruction (e.g. extrinsic compression). Acutely there is abdominal pain, ascites and hepatomegaly. The presence or absence of caudate lobe hypertrophy can help distinguish between a chronic process or an acute one where this has not had sufficient time to develop.
Hepatic veno-occlusive disease – fibrosis of the tiny venules can develop following a stem-cell transplant, and by pyrrolizidine alkaloids found in Jamaican bush teas. Clinically patients present with weight gain due to fluid retention, hepatomegaly and jaundice.
  Passive hepatic congestion
Hepatic vein obstruction
Hepatic veno-occlusive disease
Hepatomegaly, ascites and nutmeg liver
Yes

USS: Dilated IVC/hepatic veins

Increased pulsatility or reversed flow
CT: hepatic veins

Normal
MRI
-
Comma-shaped collateral vessels – spiders web (chronic feature, also visible on doppler)
-
  All three cause hepatomegaly and ascites, although fluid overload in general is a particular feature of hepatic veno-occlusive disease. On CT all three can give a ‘nutmeg’ appearance to the liver when, on early phase imaging, contrast has yet to homogenise throughout the liver and consequently there is a mottled appearance which rather resembles the cut surface of a nutmeg. On delayed phase imaging the liver becomes more homogeneous. The flip-flop sign is particularly associated with Budd-Chiari syndrome with strong central and limited peripheral enhancement on early phases followed by early central washout with retained peripheral enhancement on delayed images.
  Hepatic vein obstruction
The haemodynamics of the liver, as being different from any other organ, can give rise to some interesting pathology. Hepatic venous obstruction causes flow reversal in the portal venous system to drain the liver. Acutely this presents as a triad of abdominal pain, ascites and hepatomegaly. In many acute cases the liver function tests have not had sufficient time to become deranged. The caudate lobe usually drains directly into the IVC so may not be affected by the underlying cause of obstruction to the other hepatic veins. Consequently it is able to shoulder more of the usual burden of the liver and becomes hypertrophied. In the acute setting this has not had time to manifest and the caudate lobe will be of a normal size.
Some of the many causes of hepatic vein obstruction 
Thrombosis of the hepatic veins
Platelets (thrombocytosis)
Pill (OCP)
Pregnancy (hypercoagulable state)
Polycythaemia rubra vera
Non-thrombotic causes
Mechanical compression by a tumour
Right atrial myxoma
Constrictive pericarditis
  On CT the enhancement pattern is described as being ‘flip-flop’, with strong central and limited peripheral enhancement on early phases followed by early central washout with retained peripheral enhancement on delayed images. Alternatively the whole liver may appear mottled with a ‘nutmeg’ type pattern due to the venous congestion. On Doppler ultrasound or MRI the hepatic veins will show a reduction in calibre or not be seen at all and on Doppler insonation the hepatic veins may show little or no flow. Flow in the portal venous system, on the other hand, may be reversed. In chronic cases a veritable spiders-web of small collateral vessels can be seen on angiography; they can also be seen on MRI and are described as having a comma-shape.
  Passive hepatic congestion
This is similar to chronic hepatic vein obstruction, but whereas that arises due to hepatic outflow obstruction, in heart failure leading to hepatic congestion there is no mechanical obstruction. In contrast to acute thrombotic Budd-Chiari syndrome there is distension of the hepatic veins and IVC, a feature which distinguishes it from hepatic veno-occlusive disease as well. Other signs of heart failure, such as pleural effusions and ascites may be present concurrently.
  Hepatic veno-occlusive disease
The outcome of hepatic veno-occlusive disease is similar to that of hepatic venous obstruction but the mechanism is different. Hepatic congestion develops as a consequence of fibrosis to the venules within the liver. This can occur secondary to chemotherapy or bone marrow transplantation and also bizarrely due to pyrrolizidine alkaloids which are found in Jamaican bush teas. On imaging there is overlap with the features of hepatic venous obstruction but crucially the hepatic veins should appear normal; it is the smaller venules which cause the problem and these are not seen on ultrasound or CT.
  Primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC)
This can be difficult to distinguish from PSC however whereas PSC can involve both intra and extrahepatic ducts, PBC only involves the intrahepatic ducts. It is an autoimmune condition and, like many other autoimmune conditions, patients are typically women in their middle ages. Antimitochondrial antibodies (AMA) are present in the vast majority of patients. On imaging, the secondary cirrhotic effects are most pertinent with caudate lobe hypertrophy and left lobar atrophy. The periportal halo sign as seen on MRI is reasonably specific and relates to fluid accumulation around the portal triad.
  Viral hepatitis
The imaging findings of hepatitis are non-specific and include hepatomegaly, decreased echogenicity, periportal oedema, and gallbladder wall thickening. The ‘starry sky’ appearance is used to describe a liver which has a number of bright echogenic dots on a background of diffuse low reflectivity and this has traditionally been associated with hepatitis however both the sensitivity and specificity of this sign are low.",FALSE,"I chose number 2 because Acute Budd-Chiari Syndrome is a condition that is caused by an obstruction of the hepatic veins, which is what the Doppler study showed. This obstruction can cause ascites, hepatomegaly, and liver function tests to be deranged. It is also seen more commonly in individuals who have recently returned from a tropical holiday, such as Jamaica, which is what the patient in this case has done.",2,,B,TRUE,"I chose option 1, Hepatic veno-occlusive disease, because the patient's symptoms and ultrasound findings align with this diagnosis. Hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD) is a condition in which the small veins within the liver become blocked, leading to congestion and liver dysfunction. This can result in symptoms such as abdominal pain, ascites (fluid accumulation in the abdomen), and hepatomegaly (enlarged liver), as well as deranged liver function tests, as seen in this patient.

The increased pulsatility observed in the Doppler study also supports this diagnosis, as it indicates altered blood flow within the liver due to the obstruction of the small veins. The other options do not fit the clinical presentation and ultrasound findings as well as hepatic veno-occlusive disease does:

2. Acute Budd-Chiari syndrome typically presents with hepatomegaly, ascites, and abdominal pain, but the Doppler ultrasound would likely show abnormalities in the hepatic veins, not just increased pulsatility in the portal veins.
 
3. Primary biliary cirrhosis is a chronic liver disease that leads to progressive destruction of the bile ducts within the liver. It typically presents with fatigue, pruritus (itching), and jaundice, rather than the symptoms described in this case.

4. Passive hepatic congestion is a result of right-sided heart failure, which would likely present with additional signs of heart failure, such as jugular venous distention and peripheral edema.

5. Viral hepatitis could cause hepatomegaly and deranged liver function tests, but it would not typically present with ascites or the Doppler findings described in this case.",A,FALSE,D

Image © Medical Exam Prep
    Pelvic lipomatosis
This is a curious condition which arises in young-middle aged adults. There is significant overgrowth of fat cells within the pelvis which can lead to compression of all or any of the pelvic structures. The bladder becomes pear shaped as the main volume is pulled superiorly. Similarly, the sigmoid is elevated out of the pelvis and the rectum straightened to its shortest path. On CT there is a striking amount of low attenuation fat within the pelvis and similarly this will be seen as high T1 signal on MRI.
  A tailgut duplication cyst (retrorectal cystic hamartoma)
Curiously these occur almost exclusively in women. Anatomically they sit within the presacral or retrorectal fat. They tend to be an incidental diagnosis and can be associated with bony defects within the sacrum. Since they usually contain mucein they appear characteristically high in signal on T1 weighted MRI sequences. They can be surprisingly large and are often multiloculated.
  A Tarlov cyst
A Tarlov cyst is the name given to dilatation of the posterior nerve root sheath. They follow CSF on all sequences and can cause significant bony scalloping.
  Liposarcoma
It would not be possible to diagnose this on the basis of a barium enema. It would be a differential diagnosis for pelvic lipomatosis as seen on CT but usually contain a variable degree of soft tissue attenuation whereas the only soft tissue attenuation seen with pelvic lipomatosis results from anatomical distortion of normal structures.
  Ulcerative colitis
On a barium enema the colon and rectum can appear featureless – the so-called lead pipe appearance. Otherwise the mucosal surface is said to have a granular appearance.",FALSE,"Tarlov cysts are sacs of cerebrospinal fluid that form near the nerve roots of the sacrum. These cysts can cause a widening of the presacral space as they expand and press on adjacent structures. This can lead to a straightening of the rectum and elevation of the recto-sigmoid junction, which is what was observed in the patient's barium enema.",2,"3. A question about clinical decision making, what is the best course of action?

This question falls under category 3: A question about clinical decision making, what is the best course of action?",B,FALSE,"I chose Tarlov cyst (option 1) as the cause of widening of the presacral space because it is the most relevant option among the given choices. A Tarlov cyst, also known as a perineural or sacral nerve root cyst, is a fluid-filled sac that can develop near the sacral region of the spine, specifically in the presacral space. These cysts can cause the presacral space to widen as they grow in size.

The other options are less likely to be the cause of widening of the presacral space:

2. Chemotherapy: This is a treatment for cancer and does not directly cause widening of the presacral space.
3. Vertebral haemangioma: This is a benign vascular tumor that occurs within the vertebral body, not in the presacral space.
4. Paget's disease: This is a chronic bone disorder characterized by excessive bone breakdown and abnormal bone regrowth, typically affecting the pelvis, spine, skull, and extremities, but not specifically the presacral space.
5. Meningocoele: This is a type of spina bifida where the meninges protrude through an opening in the spine, typically occurring in the lumbar or sacral region, but not directly causing widening of the presacral space.",B,TRUE,A

Select ONE answer only.,SBA: Gastrointestinal,Liver lesion seen on CT in the superior aspect of segment VII,Hypoechoic liver lesion in the left lobe,Target lesion seen in the inferior aspect of segment V,Hypoechoic lesion in segment VI,Hyperenhancing lesion seen on CT in segment VI,A,63%,6%,11%,5%,15%,"Explanation:
Please note that the question asks which answer is NOT an indication for CEUS.
A lesion high up in segment VII is unlikely to be well visualised with ultrasound.
  Contrast enhanced ultrasound (CEUS)
CEUS is cheaper than MRI and confers less risk to the patient. The patient is injected with a contrast agent consisting of tiny microbubbles measuring micrometers in diameter. These circulate within the patient and when insonated cause strong reflections which show up as hyperechogenicity in real time as the bubbles wash in and out of the field of view. The microbubbles burst in time and the process can be repeated within a few minutes if required. There is no renal toxicity and adverse reactions are very rare meaning this is a safe procedure for almost all patients. The most significant limitation is the location of the lesion; if the lesion cannot be seen with B-mode ultrasound then it cannot be interrogated with CEUS.
It is a useful technique particularly for differentiating between malignant lesions (which tend to washout rapidly owing to their high vascularity), and benign lesions but is also useful for characterising benign lesions such as haemangiomata or focal nodular hyperplasia by demonstrating the same enhancement patterns which would otherwise be expected on an MRI.
The technique, having been developed with liver lesions in mind, is now being expanded to renal lesions, testicular masses and vascular work too, among others.",FALSE,"I chose number 3 because contrast enhanced ultrasound is used to evaluate lesions that cannot be clearly seen on ultrasound alone, such as lesions that are hypoechoic or hyperenhancing.

14474,201667,"A 40-year-old lady is brought into the Emergency Department following a fall caused by her first ever seizure. She has otherwise been fit and well. She undergoes a CT scan of her head which shows calcified lesions, each having a thin rim of low attenuation around them. A pelvis x-ray shows soft tissue calcification around the hip. What is the most likely diagnosis?",SBA: Central Nervous and Head & Neck,Neurocysticercosis,Neurofibromatosis,Cavernoma,Osteosarcoma metastases,Dermatomyositis,A,79%,3%,3%,11%,4%,"Explanation:
The information provided in this vignette is confusing since once calcified, the lesions usually do not demonstrate perilesional oedema (low attenuation). However, the presence of soft tissue calcification around the pelvis region suggests that this is the diagnosis being alluded to.
  Neurocysticercosis
Cysticercosis is caused by a tapeworm native to low income countries and carried by pigs. It is the most common parasitic infection involving the central nervous system and the central nervous system is itself commonly affected during the disease process; around 90% of cases show CNS involvement. The larva disseminate via the suparachnoid and intraventricular system and consequentially the meninges are most frequently affected, being involved in around 40% of cases, with particular involvement of the basal cisterns. Parenchymal involvement occurs in around a fifth of cases. The larval cells (termed cysticerci) also migrate to large skeletal muscle and, following destruction, become calcified and visible on plain radiographs as 'rice-grain' calcification. The long axis of the foci of calcification is usually orientated along the muscle fibres in which they are situated.
    Parasitic stage Features
Larval Small foci of oedema
Vesicular Small CSF cysts without surrounding oedema but containing a 2-3mm mural nodule (cyst with a dot)
Colloidal vesicular
Ring enhancing cyst with proteinaceous content
Focal seizures
Nodular granular stage Cyst shrinks and becomes isointense to brain on T1, hypointense on T2
Calcified stage
Small focal calcifications appearing 1-10 years following acute infection
Rice-like muscle calcification
Seizures or asymptomatic
  Cavernoma
The classical feature of a cavernoma (aka cavernous haemangioma) on MRI is the ‘popcorn’ appearance caused by a bright lobulated centre surrounded by a rim of hypointensity. Haemosiderin deposition causes the blooming artefact on susceptibility weighted sequences. It is perhaps slightly counterintuitive that there can be no enhancement on post-contrast CT scans, given the vascular nature of these lesions, however when we consider that flow within the lesion may be very slow then this makes a little more sense. Another important distinguishing feature from other lesions is the fact that, unlike metastases, there is no mass effect or oedema from these lesions, despite the fact that they can often present with seizures. Associated cutaneous manifestations of multiple cavernomas include cafe au lait spots and cherry angiomas, neither of which calcify.
  Neurofibromatosis
Type 2 neurofibromatosis (MISME) is characterised by multiple meningiomas, schwannomas and ependymomas. In theory multiple calcified meningiomas each with a rim of surrounding oedema could be present. Neurofibromatosis is also in the differential diagnosis for soft tissue calcification though this relates to curvilinear calcifications related to plexiform neurofibromas (ie type 1 neurofibromatosis).
  Osteosarcoma metastases
Osteosarcoma can cause soft tissue calcification, and within the lungs is a classic cause for calcified lung metastases however brain metastases (from all causes) rarely calcify. In the few cases reported in the literature the calcification is more globular than peripheral/rim calcification.
  Dermatomyositis
This is a classic cause of soft tissue calcification with striking 'sheets' of calcification occurring in severe cases. Intracranial calcification is not a feature however.",FALSE,Neurofibromatosis is a genetic disorder that causes tumors to grow along the nerves in the body. The calcified lesions on the CT scan and the soft tissue calcification around the hip are both symptoms of this disorder.,2,,A,TRUE,"I chose option 1, Neurocysticercosis, because the clinical scenario and imaging findings are consistent with this diagnosis. Neurocysticercosis is a parasitic infection caused by the larval stage of the tapeworm Taenia solium. It is the most common parasitic infection of the central nervous system, and can present with seizures, which is the case in this patient.

The CT scan findings of calcified lesions with a thin rim of low attenuation around them are characteristic of neurocysticercosis. These calcified lesions represent dead cysticerci, while the low attenuation rim suggests inflammation or edema around the lesions.

The soft tissue calcification around the hip seen on the pelvis x-ray can also be seen in systemic cysticercosis, as the larvae can migrate to various tissues in the body, including muscles.

The other options are less likely given the clinical and imaging findings:
2. Neurofibromatosis typically presents with multiple neurofibromas and café-au-lait spots, not calcified lesions in the brain.
3. Cavernomas are vascular malformations in the brain, which would not explain the soft tissue calcification in the pelvis.
4. Osteosarcoma metastases would be expected to involve the bones, not present as calcified lesions in the brain and soft tissue calcification in the pelvis.

Please note that the question asks which of the answers is NOT correct.
MLO and CC are the standard views performed at screening.
If further view are required these are usually decided on a case-by-case basis.
  A true lateral view can help demonstrate suspected teacup calcifications are teacup calcifications. Compression views are used to interrogate suspicious calcifications seen on mammograms further.
A rolled CC view can help separate out structures to prove that the 'mass' seen on the original mammogram was a summation shadow, or to confirm the presence of a mass.
  Teacup calcifications
Teacup calcifications are caused by liquid milk of calcium within fibrocystic change. On mammography they appear as small curvilinear thin calcifications resembling the fluid level in a teacup on lateral views and rounded on a craniocaudal view, like a teacup viewed from above. Although teacup calcifications are typically benign in nature and suggestive of only fibrocystic changes they must be distinguished from suspicious calcifications. Thus, the best views for confirming the presence of teacup calcifications would be a true lateral, as opposed to an oblique lateral, and a CC view.",FALSE,"A true lateral view is not used in mammography. This view is not useful for investigating teacup calcifications because it does not provide enough magnification. Instead, a magnified CC view is used to investigate teacup calcifications.

Please note that the question asks which answer is INCORRECT.
  Benign intracranial hypertension - (idiopathic intracranial hypertension)
This condition can easily be overlooked but causes significant morbidity for patients if undiagnosed. Increased intracranial pressure of the CSF on the surrounding brain causes:
Flattening of the posterior aspect of the globe
Tortuosity of the optic nerves
Empty sella syndrome (or partially so)
Small, 'pinched' lateral ventricles (slit-like appearance is a relatively rare, poor sign to rely on).
  Sagittal sinus thrombosis
In sagittal sinus thrombosis the development of cerebral oedema secondary to infarction can compress the lateral ventricles, a finding in approximately a third of cases.
In contrast to this, prominent temporal horns, suggestive of developing hydrocephalus can be seen in sagittal sinus thrombosis due to decreased CSF absorption.
Ventricular bleeds might be seen in sagittal sinus thrombosis in the neonatal age group.
Bilateral haemorrhages in the context of sagittal sinus thrombosis are caused by venous infarction.
Papilloedema can be seen with both sagittal sinus thrombosis and idiopathic intracranial hypertension but is not an imaging feature.",FALSE,"Ventricular bleeds are not commonly seen in benign intracranial hypertension.

In patients with heart rates below around 70 beats per minute, end-diastole is the optimal time for imaging. In these patients, diastole is the longest period the heart is still for, and therefore ideal for imaging.
Diastole is also the part of the cardiac cycle which decreases in duration when the heart rate increases. This reduces the duration of the imaging window during cardiac CT. The period of time the heart remains still for in systole stays constant when the heart rate increases. Therefore in patients with increased heart rates, imaging at end-systole is the optimal target.",FALSE,"End-diastole is the optimal phase of the cardiac cycle for image acquisition in this patient because it is the period of the cardiac cycle when the heart is most relaxed and the ventricles are filled with the most blood. This allows for the best visualization of the heart's chambers and vessels. Additionally, the patient's resting heart rate decreases to 85 beats per minute with a breath hold, which is indicative of a lower heart rate and thus a longer diastolic phase. Therefore, end-diastole is the best phase of the cardiac cycle to image in this patient.",1,"3. A question about the application of clinical knowledge, what is the best course of action?",C,FALSE,"I chose end-diastole as the optimal phase for image acquisition in this patient because it is the phase of the cardiac cycle when the heart is most relaxed and filled with blood. During this phase, the heart's motion is minimal, which allows for better image quality and reduced motion artifacts in the CT scan.

In a cardiac CT, it is crucial to minimize motion artifacts to obtain high-quality images for accurate diagnosis. In patients with a high heart rate, like this patient, image acquisition during end-diastole is preferred because it provides a longer period of minimal motion compared to other phases of the cardiac cycle. Additionally, since beta-blockers are contraindicated for this patient due to her severe brittle asthma, it is even more important to choose the phase with the least motion to optimize image quality.",C,TRUE,A

She is worried as she has a strong family history of heart problems. She undergoes a 24-hour ECG which is normal, but an exercise ECG shows some lateral T-wave inversion. An Adenosine stress MRI is planned for further evaluation. Which of the following is NOT a contra-indication to Adenosine stress MRI? Select ONE answer only.",SBA: Cardiothoracic and vascular,Hypotension 100/60mmHg,Severe aortic stenosis,Gastric pacemaker,Uncontrolled atrial fibrillation,Bronchospasm,A,47%,3%,36%,5%,8%,"Explanation:
Please note that the question asks which is NOT a contraindication.
  Adenosine stress MRI has overtaken dobutamine stress MRI in terms of sensitivity and specificity for investigating the presence of ischaemia or infarction. Adenosine causes coronary vasodilation. If there is a haemodynamically significant stenosis to a coronary vessel, the vessels distal to the stenosis are already maximally dilated to maximise flow and thus the application of adenosine makes no difference to the vessel calibre or the resultant perfusion. Furthermore, the vasodilatation to the remaining unoccluded vessels can 'steal' blood from the stenosed territory and this is seen as hypoperfusion to the affected territory. Dipyridamole (antiplatelet), blocks uptake of adenosine and so patients taking this are also poor candidates for this test, however dipyridimole itself can also induce vasodilatation so may be used as an agent in its own right instead of adenosine.
Contraindications to adenosine include:
Second or third degree heart block
Bronchospasm
Hypotension <90mmHg systolic
Myocardial infarction within 48hrs
Uncontrolled arrhythmia
Severe/critical aortic stenosis
  The half-life of adenosine is exceptionally short, around 10 seconds, thus any side effects experienced during the scan resolve very quickly. It also means that during the scan, in order to maintain the effect, the adenosine must be given as an infusion.
Dobutamine stress MRI has been shown to be more sensitive and specific for cardiac disease than a dobutamine stress echocardiogram. It is a sympathomimetic so works by inducing the heart to beat both faster and stronger. By increasing the stress on the whole heart, hitherto compensated areas are unmasked. The drug is given at increasing doses ever 3 minutes until any of:
  The heart rate has increased to around 85% of its resting maximum
New wall motion abnormality is seen
Blood pressure rises above 240/220mmHg
Systolic blood pressure falls by 40mmHg
The patient develops persistent arrhythmias
The patient becomes too symptomatic to continue the scan
  Aside from the usual contra-indications to performing the MRI in the first place, specific contra-indications to performing a dobutamine stress MRI include:
Hypertension >220/120mmHg
Unstable angina
Aortic stenosis (severe)
Uncontrolled atrial fibrillation
Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy
Congestive heart failure",FALSE,"I chose 3. Gastric pacemaker as the correct answer because Adenosine stress MRI is contraindicated in patients with pacemakers and implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs). Adenosine stress MRI can cause interference with the pacemaker or ICD, leading to potentially dangerous results.",1,"3. A question about clinical judgement, what is the correct management?",D,TRUE,"I chose option 5 (Hypotension 100/60mmHg) as it is NOT a contra-indication to Adenosine stress MRI. Adenosine stress MRI is a diagnostic test used to evaluate the blood flow to the heart muscle during stress and rest conditions. Contra-indications are factors that make this test potentially unsafe or less accurate for a patient.

In this case, the other options are contra-indications for the following reasons:
1. Severe aortic stenosis: Adenosine stress MRI can cause increased stress on the heart, which may be dangerous for patients with severe aortic stenosis.
2. Gastric pacemaker: The magnetic field of the MRI can interfere with the functioning of the pacemaker, causing it to malfunction.
3. Uncontrolled atrial fibrillation: Adenosine stress MRI can exacerbate the atrial fibrillation, leading to more severe symptoms and potential complications.
4. Bronchospasm: Adenosine stress MRI can cause bronchospasm, which may worsen respiratory symptoms in patients with asthma or other respiratory conditions.

Option 5 (Hypotension 100/60mmHg) is not a contra-indication because a blood pressure of 100/60mmHg is still within the normal range for many individuals. While adenosine can cause some vasodilation and a temporary drop in blood pressure, this value is not low enough to pose a significant risk during the test.",A,TRUE,A

Leigh disease is a rare, inherited neurometabolic disorder characterized by rapidly progressive ataxia, ophthalmoplegia, dystonia, and respiratory rhythm disturbance. The elevated lactate to pyruvate ratio in blood serum is also a common finding in Leigh disease, as it indicates a possible defect in mitochondrial energy production.

The MRI findings mentioned, such as high T2 signal in the putamen and periaqueductal grey matter, are characteristic of Leigh disease. These areas are often affected due to their high energy demands and vulnerability to mitochondrial dysfunction.

It has an anechoic centre and demonstrates peripheral vascularity on colour Doppler flow. A βHCG urine test performed the same day was negative. What is the most likely diagnosis?,"SBA: Genito urinary, Adrenal, Obstetrics & Gynaecology and Breast",Corpus luteum cyst,Mature teratoma,Yolk sac tumour,Endometrioma,Leydig-Sertoli tumour,A,83%,2%,2%,8%,4%,"Explanation:
Corpus luteal cyst
The corpus luteum comprises the remnant of an ovarian follicle post ovulation. Without fertilisation the normal corpus luteum will involute spontaneously within 2 weeks but occasionally they can persist even in the absence of fertilisation and be seen as a corpus luteum cyst. Ultrasound characteristics depend slightly on the age of the cyst and the presence or absence of haemorrhage within it but a small (<3 cm) thick walled, rounded, cystic structure with peripheral vascularity (the so-called ‘ring of fire’) would be classical. A repeat ultrasound scan after 6 weeks (to ensure a different part of the menstrual cycle) is usually recommended.
  Mature teratoma
Teratomas and dermoid cysts have very similar imaging characteristics despite their histological differences. Teratomas are the most common ovarian neoplasm but are slow growing and usually benign. By contrast immature teratomas are malignant. The presence of fat is a strong indicator for a mature teratoma with the combination of fat, fluid and calcification being highly specific. On MRI the fat will show the usual signal drop-out on gradient echo sequences. Calcification will show as low signal on T2. Although benign, mature teratomas can be complicated by torsion or rupture. Malignant degeneration if it does occur, is to squamous cell carcinoma most commonly.
  Endometrioma 
These occur as part of the spectrum of endometriosis. Although often ovarian in location they can be found in the peritoneal cavity as well as elsewhere. The ectopic endometrial tissue undergoes cyclical haemorrhage leading to a build-up of blood products and debris which gives rise to a variety of imaging characteristics. Most commonly they appear as a single cyst with posterior acoustic enhancement and homogeneous internal low-level echoes on ultrasound. On MRI the signal characteristics will vary depending on the blood content. High T1 signal suggests old blood products but must be differentiated from the fat of a potential teratoma by checking to see that the signal persists (or is not suppressed) on the fat saturated sequences. The presence of the Shading sign is very suggestive of an endometrioma and occurs when there is low signal on T2 as blood products are usually low on T2. The shading sign is useful to make the distinction from haemorrhagic corpus luteal cysts since the fresh blood in those will not have degraded sufficient to cause the T2 darkening of endometriomas.
  Yolk sac tumour
These unpleasant germ cell tumours affect adolescents and can be quite large at presentation. A raised serum AFP is common. They are usually solid with or without cystic areas. Since they can arise from an ovarian dermoid, sometimes fat signal can also be seen in association with these tumours.
  Leydig-Sertoli tumour
It would be unusual to find a Leydig-Sertoli tumour in a patient older than 30 and most patients are in their early teens. Normal Leydig and Sertoli cells are found in the testes and produce testosterone and oestrogen respectively, among other hormones. Leydig-Sertoli tumours often produce one or both hormones in excess leading to virilisation and amenorrhoea, although some patients may experience no hormonal manifestations. AFP is often elevated. They are solid, fibrous tumours which can show cystic elements where haemorrhage or necrosis has taken place. Owing to their fibrous nature they usually return low signal on MRI, with/without high signal foci related to the cystic areas.",FALSE,"Mature teratomas are the most common type of ovarian cyst seen in women of reproductive age. They are typically characterized by an anechoic centre and peripheral vascularity on color Doppler flow. The presence of a negative βHCG urine test also supports the diagnosis of a mature teratoma, as these cysts are not associated with hormonal production.",2,,B,TRUE,"I chose option 1, corpus luteum cyst, as the most likely diagnosis based on the information provided. The patient is a 33-year-old lady being investigated for primary infertility, which means she is likely to be ovulating. A corpus luteum cyst is a common, benign ovarian lesion that forms after ovulation.

The ultrasound findings also support this diagnosis. The lesion has an anechoic (fluid-filled) center and peripheral vascularity on color Doppler flow, which are characteristic features of a corpus luteum cyst. 

Additionally, the negative βHCG urine test rules out a pregnancy-related condition, such as an ectopic pregnancy, which could also present with a similar ultrasound appearance.

11661,201667,A 17-year-old girl is being investigated for primary amenorrhoea. On examination she has normal secondary sexual characteristics. An HSG shows there to be a blind ended vagina and she goes on to have an MRI scan. This shows complete aplasia of the uterus but the fallopian tubes and ovaries are well demonstrated. What is the most likely diagnosis?,SBA: Paediatrics,Mayer-Rokitansky-Kuster-Hauser (MRKH) syndrome,Uterus didelphys,Arcuate uterus,Septate uterus,"Bicornuate, bicervix uterus",A,97%,1%,1%,0%,0%,"Explanation:
Mullerian duct anomalies (MDA)
The two Mullerian ducts form separately then fuse in the first trimester to form all the structures between the upper vagina and the fallopian tubes. The final part of the amalgamation of the two sides is resorption of the central uterine septum.  There are various classification systems the scope of which is subspecialist. The following is provided for a gross overview only. Different anomalies occur depending on when during development the disruption to normality occurred.
       Aplasia/hypoplasia anomalies
Class I – Agenesis or hypoplasia:
Mayer-Rokitansky-Kuster-Hauser (MRKH) syndrome is an extreme subtype where there is complete aplasia of the upper third of the vagina and uterus. The fallopian tubes and ovaries will be seen normally. Primary amenorrhoea is the usual presentation.
Class II – Unicornuate: Banana like configuration of the remaining horn
Fusion anomalies
Class III - Didelphys: Non-fusion, two separate uterine horns, two separate cervices. All of the walls contain all of the layers of the normal uterus. The uterine cavities do not communicate with one another owing to the presence of a vaginal septum.
Class IV – Bicornuate: partial fusion, the septum separating the two horns consists of myometrium. There can be either one or two cervices depending on the degree of fusion but crucially the two uterine cavities do communicate with one another. Sometimes the appearance of a bicornuate uterus is referred to as ‘heart-shaped’.
Reabsorption (of uterine septum) anomalies
Class V – Septate: partial fusion, a fibrous remnant septum remains. This is the most common anomaly presenting as infertility.
Class VI – Arcuate: a mild form of septate uterus but which is not associated with subfertility.
The crucial diagnosis to make is that of a septate uterus. Patients with a septate uterus can present with recurrent mid-term miscarriages due to implantation on the suboptimally vascularised septum. Surgical resection of this septum can significantly improve fertility chances. Distinguishing between didelphys and bicollis bicornuate uteri can be very challenging and is beyond the scope of this text.
There is no association with abnormalities of the external genitalia or ovaries since these derive from different embryological components but renal anomalies (agenesis, ectopia, fusion) can be found in around a third of patients and should be actively sought. Infertility is the primary clinical consequence of an MDA.
  Hysterosalpingogram (HSG)
HSGs are performed in the setting of infertility to confirm or refute tubal patency. It is not the ideal modality to diagnose MDAs since it provides information only on the internal contours of any patent cavities. Historically the intercornual angle was used to differentiate between a septate uterus (<75o) and a bicornuate or didelphys uterus (>105o) but this is no longer considered reliable. In addition an HSG will overlook obstructed hemisystems or functional remnants which do not communicate with the vagina.
  Ultrasound
Differentiating between fusion anomalies (bicornuate and didelphys) and reabsorption anomalies (septate and arcuate) depends on the fundal contour. Usually this can be well seen on ultrasound. Where there has been a failure of complete fusion a fundal cleft remains. This should be at least 1cm deep.  If the patient has a septate or arcuate uterus then fusion is complete so the fundus will be domed as is normal. A normal dome is greater than 5mm high.
  MRI
MRI is considered the gold standard for evaluating cases of MDA. The presence of menstrual blood products within an obstructed hemi uterus is, where present, readily seen as high signal on T1. Where a patient has two cervices these can be seen appearing like two ‘owl eyes’ when imaged axially to the vagina.
  Diethylstilbestrol (DES) exposure
DES was an artificial oestrogen used to treat women suffering from recurrent miscarriages. Owing to an association with clear cell carcinoma of the vagina and cervix its use was halted in the 1970s. It also caused shortening of the upper segment of the uterus which gave rise to a very characteristic T-shaped uterine cavity as seen on HSG. This was classed as a Class VII type of MDA.
Pertinent points:
Renal agenesis, ectopia and fusion present in 33% of patients
Aplastic uterus + normal fallopian tubes and ovaries = MRKH syndrome
Widely divergent horns + fundal cleft = fusion anomaly (didelphys or bicornuate)
Two cervices also known as owl eyes on MRI = either didelphys or bicollis bicornuate (difficult to tell them apart)
No communication between two uterine horns = didelphys
Domed fundus = reabsorption anomaly (Septate or arcuate)
Recurrent midterm miscarriages can be due to septate uterus and can be surgically resected to improve fertility.",TRUE,"I chose number 5 because the MRI scan showed complete aplasia of the uterus, which is a characteristic of Mayer-Rokitansky-Kuster-Hauser (MRKH) syndrome. The other options are all congenital abnormalities of the uterus that can cause primary amenorrhoea, but none of them involve complete aplasia of the uterus.",2,,A,TRUE,"I chose Mayer-Rokitansky-Kuster-Hauser (MRKH) syndrome as the most likely diagnosis because the clinical findings and imaging results align with the typical features of this condition. MRKH syndrome is characterized by congenital aplasia of the uterus and the upper part of the vagina, while the fallopian tubes and ovaries are usually unaffected. This matches the description given, where the patient has primary amenorrhoea, a blind-ended vagina, and an MRI scan showing complete aplasia of the uterus but normal fallopian tubes and ovaries.

The other options are less likely due to the following reasons:

1. Uterus didelphys: This condition involves the presence of two separate uteri and often two cervices, which is not consistent with the MRI findings of complete uterine aplasia.

2. Arcuate uterus: This is a mild uterine anomaly characterized by a small, inward indentation on the uterine fundus. It does not involve complete uterine aplasia, as seen in the MRI scan.

3. Septate uterus: This condition involves a septum that divides the uterine cavity into two parts. It does not involve complete uterine aplasia, as seen in the MRI scan.

5. Bicornuate, bicervix uterus: This condition involves a uterus that is divided into two separate cavities, each with its own cervix. It does not involve complete uterine aplasia, as seen in the MRI scan.",A,TRUE,A
11671,201667,"An 8-year-old boy complains of pain following a sports injury where he received a kick to the scrotum. On ultrasound the scrotal skin appears thickened, the epididymis swollen and on colour Doppler imaging the flow within the left testicle is markedly increased. What is the most likely diagnosis?",SBA: Paediatrics,Reversed torsion,Acute torsion,Epididymo-orchitis,Non seminomatous germ cell tumour,Bell-clapper effect,A,40%,8%,40%,1%,11%,"Explanation:
Reversed torsion also known as torsion-detorsion sequence
Increased blood flow within the testicle is either caused by infection or reversed torsion (a testicular tumour can also show increased blood flow).
  Testicular torsion
Acute testicular torsion is a surgical emergency and in the prepubertal age bracket torsion is more common than infection as a cause of testicular pain. Even 180o of torsion can result in reduced blood flow, however complete ischemia is usually only seen in cases of >720o of torsion. Time is of essence; as early as three hours there will be some irreversibility within the testicle. Ideally the diagnosis should be made clinically and the patient taken straight to theatre without need for an ultrasound diagnosis. When an ultrasound is performed, either in the emergent setting or in cases of a misdiagnosis of epidiymo-orchitis the testicle can appear normal in echotexture, especially within the first 6 hours, thus a normal scrotal ultrasound does not rule torsion out. Diffuse hypoechogenicity is seen beyond this and heterogeneity suggests necrosis. Scrotal skin oedema occurs and is usually readily visible on ultrasound. With the advent of colour Doppler further information can be gleaned. Reduced signal in the spermatic cord and reduced testicular flow are both signs of torsion. Since venous occlusion occurs prior to arterial occlusion, apparently normal blood flow on colour Doppler does not exclude torsion.
  Bell-clapper deformity
This is the most common cause of testicular torsion. When the tunica vaginalis inserts high onto the spermatic cord, the testis is left hanging in a lateral position and takes on an appearance mimicking the central part of a bell, known as the clapper. In this position the testicle is more vulnerable to twisting on its axis with compromise to the blood flow leading to ischaemia.
  Epididymo-orchitis
Infection of the epididymis with concomitant infection of the testis is called epididymo-orchitis; it is seen most commonly in young adolescents with Chlamydia and Gonorrhoea accounting for most cases in this age range. In older patients E-coli and proteus are more likely to be responsible. Ultrasound is useful only in excluding testicular torsion as a cause of the pain (although a normal scrotal ultrasound does not exclude torsion), and investigating the possibility of abscess formation in cases refractory to antibiotic therapy. On ultrasound a reactive hydrocoele is often present and epididymal enlargement occurs. Colour Doppler flow can be used to demonstrate hyperaemia within the testicle and epididymis as would be expected for an infective process.
  Non-seminomatous germ cell tumours
Germ cell tumours are divided into seminomas and non-seminomatous varieties each of which accounts for approximately half of cases. They can often be found incidentally or subsequent to any trauma which might cause the patient to self-examine and discover a testicular lump. Alternatively they can present as a vague dull scrotal aching sensation with no lump.
They typically are found in relatively young patients. Testicular tumours can be diagnosed with a strong pre-test probability based solely on age as detailed in the table below. Ultrasound features vary slightly according to the exact tumour type.

 ",FALSE,"Acute torsion is the most likely diagnosis in this case because the symptoms are consistent with it. The pain following a sports injury, the thickened scrotal skin, the swollen epididymis, and the increased flow within the left testicle are all indicative of acute torsion. Acute torsion is a medical emergency and requires immediate surgical intervention.",2,,B,FALSE,"I chose option 3, Epididymo-orchitis, as the most likely diagnosis because the given symptoms and ultrasound findings align with this condition. The thickened scrotal skin and swollen epididymis are common signs of inflammation, which is characteristic of epididymo-orchitis. Additionally, the markedly increased blood flow within the left testicle on color Doppler imaging further supports the presence of inflammation and infection, rather than the other options listed. 

Torsion (options 1 and 2) would typically present with decreased or absent blood flow on Doppler imaging, while a germ cell tumor (option 4) would not typically cause these acute inflammatory changes.

The key differentiator between dorsal pancreatic agenesis and lipomatosis is the absence of the pancreatic duct. If no duct is visualised, this suggests agenesis over lipomatosis. Furthermore lipomatosis usually affects the whole gland and does not spare the pancreatic head. Dorsal agenesis is much more common than total pancreatic agenesis.
The most common cause of pancreatic lipomatosis in children is cystic fibrosis, the second most common cause is Shwachman-Diamond syndrome. Additional features of this condition include short stature with metaphyseal chondroplasia and eczema. Steroid use and Cushing syndrome are also associated with lipomatosis.",TRUE,"Dorsal pancreatic agenesis is the most likely underlying diagnosis in this case. This is because the MRCP scan demonstrates a rounded pancreatic head with the absence of the neck, body, and tail of the pancreas.

8896,201667,A 35-year-old man visits his GP after noticing that his stools have become very light in colour and difficult to flush away. On direct questioning he confirms he has also been losing weight recently. Blood tests show an iron-deficiency anaemia and he undergoes a small bowel follow through which is reported as showing flocculation and segmentation although the fold thickness is reported to be normal. Which of the following would best fit with these findings?,SBA: Gastrointestinal,Coeliac disease,Scleroderma,Mastocytosis,Lymphoma,Eosinophilic enteropathy,A,83%,7%,4%,1%,5%,"Explanation:
Fold thickness
Much is made on barium examinations, of the thickness of the folds and whether there is any nodularity. Such features can be helpful in teasing apart the possible diagnoses in similar cases.
Coeliac disease – dilatation without increase in fold thickness
Scleroderma – dilatation without loss of valvulae conniventes, prolonged transit time
Zollinger-Ellison syndrome – dilatation of the proximal small bowel due to hypersecretion
Small bowel lymphoma – fold thickening and lymph node enlargement
Mastocytosis – nodular fold thickening with sclerotic bone lesions
Crohn disease – nodular fold thickening
Whipple disease – thickened folds (+/- microndularity) without dilatation, with normal transit time
  Coeliac disease
Luminal sensitivity to gluten leads to autoimmune mediated atrophy of villi within the small bowel. Iron-deficiency anaemia, malabsorption and deficiency of the fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E and K) result. Classically on imaging there is jejunisation of the ileum (ie an increased number of ileal folds and a decreased number of jejunal folds) which is a reasonably specific sign to coeliac disease. Importantly however the fold thickness is not increased, in contrast to many of the possible differential diagnoses. On historic fluoroscopic examinations flocculation, segmentation are supposed to be typical and result from hypersecretion of fluid however modern barium preparations are less susceptible to these effects. The moulage sign (complete loss of jejunal folds such that the bowel wall appears smooth) is also quoted. A rare complication is cavitating mesenteric lymph node syndrome where lymph nodes within the small bowel mesentry show low attenuation on CT and characteristically have fat-fluid levels. In such cases the spleen may also be atrophic.
  Mastocytosis
Mast cells store histamine (among other things). Where they exist in excess the resultant symptoms fit with excess histamine release. Patients complain of nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, hypotension, flushing and abdominal pain. Asthma-type symptoms can also occur. On imaging hepatosplenomegaly and lymph node enlargement are common. The walls of the small bowel become thickened and malabsorption occurs too. Mastocytosis is also a cause of bony sclerosis.

  Eosinophilic enteropathy
This is a rare condition caused by infiltration of eosinophils into the wall of the small bowel. Patients often suffer from food allergies and experience multiple attacks of abdominal pain, diarrhoea and vomiting in a relapsing/remitting pattern. Blood eosinophil levels are usually raised. On imaging the folds of the small bowel can appear thickened.
  Scleroderma
Scleroderma is a multi-system connective tissue disease leading to fibrosis and loss of smooth muscle. In the gastrointestinal system this leads to the hidebound sign (similar but different to stacked coin sign which is seen in intramural haematoma where the folds are thickened) where, despite being dilated in calibre, the small bowel still retains the valvulae conniventes which would otherwise be effaced. This is thought to result from fibrosis of the longitudinal layer causing foreshortening along the long axis. In the small bowel there can also be the formation of square-shaped broad-based sacculations (true-diverticulae because they involve all layers of the bowel wall) on the mesenteric border of the bowel is seen owing to uneven atrophy of the smooth muscle there. A prolonged transit time would be ususal. Pseudosacculations (wide-mouthed diverticulae) are found in the colon but this time on the antimesenteric border. (The *only* anti-mesenteric diverticulum of the small bowel is a Meckel's diverticulum.)
    Small bowel lymphoma
Malignancies of the small bowel are rare but lymphoma is the most common of these. Coeliac disease, infection with H. Pylori and AIDs both predispose patients to developing small bowel lymphoma. Perhaps surprisingly patients do not present with obstruction even when the tumour burden is large, similarly neoplastic perforation is not common. Instead patients present with insidious symptoms or haemorrhage. On imaging there is (sometimes extensive) thickening of the bowel wall, often with associated lymph node enlargement.",TRUE,"Coeliac disease is an autoimmune disorder in which the body's immune system mistakenly attacks the cells of the small intestine. This can lead to the symptoms described in the question, including light-colored stools, difficulty flushing them away, and weight loss. The small bowel follow through would likely show flocculation and segmentation, which are both common findings in cases of coeliac disease.",1,"3. A question about clinical reasoning, what is the appropriate management for the patient?",A,TRUE,"I chose Coeliac disease because the symptoms and findings described in the question best fit with this condition. 

Coeliac disease is an autoimmune disorder that primarily affects the small intestine. It is triggered by the ingestion of gluten, a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. The symptoms mentioned, such as light-colored stools that are difficult to flush away, weight loss, and iron-deficiency anemia, are all common manifestations of Coeliac disease. These symptoms occur due to malabsorption of nutrients as a result of damage to the small intestine.

The small bowel follow-through findings of flocculation and segmentation are also suggestive of Coeliac disease. Flocculation refers to the clumping together of barium in the small bowel, and segmentation refers to the separation of barium into small segments along the bowel. These findings can be indicative of changes in the mucosal pattern due to Coeliac disease. Although the fold thickness is reported to be normal, this does not rule out the possibility of Coeliac disease, as the condition can present with varying degrees of severity.

The other options provided (Scleroderma, Mastocytosis, Lymphoma, and Eosinophilic enteropathy) can also affect the gastrointestinal system, but the combination of symptoms, blood test results, and small bowel follow-through findings make Coeliac disease the most likely diagnosis in this case.",A,FALSE,B

Her inflammatory markers are raised but she is initially thought to have a ureteric calculus and undergoes a CT KUB. No radio-opaque calculus is seen but the radiologist reports that the gynaecological organs do not appear normal. She subsequently undergoes a transvaginal ultrasound scan which shows an enlarged uterus containing an IUCD with an apparent soft tissue mass sitting anterior to the uterus and invading the bladder. The adnexae are poorly demonstrated. Of the following, which is the most likely diagnosis?","SBA: Genito urinary, Adrenal, Obstetrics & Gynaecology and Breast",Actinomycosis,Tuberculosis,Pseudomyxoma peritonei,Gonorrhoeal pelvic inflammatory disease,Indinavir phosphate calculus,A,65%,2%,3%,27%,2%,"Explanation:
Actinomycosis
Various species of actinomyces reside within the gastrointestinal and genitourinary tracts without causing any problems however opportunistic infections can occur when there is a breach to the mucosa. Thus pelvic actinomycosis tends to be consequent from events such as IUCD placement, surgery or trauma. Broadly speaking the imaging features will be those of pelvic inflammatory disease with pelvic fat stranding on CT, intraperitoneal free fluid and possible tubo-ovarian abscess formation, though more specifically this is an organism which crosses tissue planes readily and may appear to be behaving in an invasive manner. Free fluid of an increased density above 0-10HU suggests either an infective cause, haemorrhage or a high protein content.
  Pseudomyxoma peritonei
When a mucocoele of the appendix ruptures, mucein begins to accumulate within the peritoneal cavity within defined locules, eventually filling the entire space. On CT this appears as low attenuation ascites and scalloping of the liver by loculated collections allow the distinction from ascites proper. 
The condition can arise from intraperitoneal rupture of any mucein producing tumour including stomach, pancreas, colon or ovary, but those of the appendix account for the majority.
  Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID)
This is a coverall term applied to ascending infection of the genital tract. It encompasses endometritis, salpingitis, hydrosalpinx, pyosalpinx, and tubo-ovarian abscesses. Chlamydia and gonorrhoea account of most of the cases and the disease is most prevalent in sexually active young people. Imaging features are those secondary to inflammation with increased vascularity to the endometrium and small volume ascites. Inflammation is also seen on MRI as avid enhancement post contrast. Pelvic Inflammatory Disease can be complicated by a condition called Fitz-Hugh-Curtis syndrome where there is perihepatitis secondary to PID. 
  Tuberculous pelvic inflammatory disease
TB tends to affect the Fallopian tubes, causing many separate strictured points which causes a beaded appearance on HSG. On CT the presence of calcified pelvic lymph nodes may point at the diagnosis.
  Urinary tract calculi
Ureteric colic is common and urinary tract calculi are even more so. There are many metabolic disorders which increase the risk of developing urinary tract calculi but many patients do develop calculi without any underlying cause. Stones can obstruct at any point along the urinary tract however the three narrowest points which are most liable to obstruction are the pelviureteric junction (PUJ), the vesicoureteric junction (VUJ) and at the point where the ureters cross the pelvic brim. As the ureter peristalses a characteristic extremely severe ‘loin-to-groin’ pain is experienced. A CT KUB study is a low dose, non-contrast, exam designed specifically to investigate for urinary tract calculi. A standard CT abdo/pelvis confers three times as much radiation dose at the very least. Although A CT KUB has a very high sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of opaque urinary tract calculi it is distinctly suboptimal for the evaluation of other causes of abdominal pain. Unfortunately since its introduction it has become a popular request for many a supposed loin-to-groin pain presentation.

 ",FALSE,"Pseudomyxoma peritonei is the most likely diagnosis because it is characterized by the presence of an IUCD and a soft tissue mass that is invading the bladder. This is consistent with the findings from the transvaginal ultrasound scan. Additionally, pseudomyxoma peritonei is a rare but serious condition that is caused by the spread of mucinous material from a tumor in the appendix. This could explain the raised inflammatory markers that the patient presented with.",2,,C,TRUE,"I chose Actinomycosis (option 1) as the most likely diagnosis because the clinical presentation and imaging findings are consistent with this condition. Actinomycosis is a rare, chronic bacterial infection caused by Actinomyces species, which can lead to the formation of abscesses and sinus tracts. In the case of pelvic actinomycosis, the infection is often associated with the presence of an intrauterine contraceptive device (IUCD), as mentioned in the scenario.

The patient presents with fevers, acute pelvic pain, and raised inflammatory markers, which are all suggestive of an ongoing infection. The transvaginal ultrasound findings of an enlarged uterus with an IUCD, an apparent soft tissue mass invading the bladder, and poorly demonstrated adnexae further support the diagnosis of Actinomycosis.

The other options listed are less likely in this case:

2. Tuberculosis - While tuberculosis can involve the pelvic organs, it is less likely to be associated with the presence of an IUCD and the specific ultrasound findings described.
3. Pseudomyxoma peritonei - This is a rare condition characterized by the presence of mucin-producing tumors in the peritoneal cavity, which is not consistent with the clinical presentation and imaging findings in this case.
4. Gonorrhoeal pelvic inflammatory disease - Although it can cause pelvic pain and inflammation, it is less likely to present with the specific ultrasound findings described and the association with an IUCD.

Multiple large cysts can be seen in communication with one another in the region of the left kidney. The right kidney appears normal. What is the most likely diagnosis?,SBA: Paediatrics,Hydronephrosis,Multicystic dysplastic kidney,Mesoblastic nephroma,Nephroblastoma,Multilocular cystic nephroma,A,63%,20%,4%,1%,12%,"Explanation:
The main differential diagnosis in this case is of multicystic dysplastic kidney but the most common cause of a neonatal renal mass is hydronephrosis. It is distinguishable from a multicystic dysplastic kidney by the fact that the apparent 'cysts' communicate with each other. On a MAG3 scan there should also be a small amount of activity within normal renal tissue; this normal renal tissue is completely absent in cases of multicystic dysplastic kidney.
  Multicystic dysplastic kidney
A Multicystic Dysplastic kidney is the second most common cause of a neonatal abdominal mass. The normal renal architecture is entirely replaced by a non-functioning mass of cysts separated from one another by fibrous tissue. The overall appearance is said to resemble a bunch of grapes. If unilateral, the condition can be asymptomatic or can present as recurrent urinary tract infections.

9341,201667,A 66-year-old man is admitted to ITU following complications during his recent coronary artery bypass grafting. He is intubated and ventilated but his doctors notice abdominal distension and elevation of his inflammatory markers and arterial blood sampling shows elevation of his serum lactate. He undergoes a CT scan which shows mucosal hyperenhancement and thumbprinting of the transverse colon and splenic flexure. Which of the following is the most likely explanation for these findings?,SBA: Gastrointestinal,Hypotension,Superior mesenteric artery thrombus,Inferior mesenteric artery thrombus,Coeliac axis stricture,Internal iliac artery stricture,A,45%,34%,21%,1%,0%,"Explanation:
The term hypotension is a little misleading. It is more accurate to say hypoperfusion or shock in the given scenario.
  Ischaemic colitis
Anything that compromises the vascular supply to the bowl can cause ischaemic colitis. This can be a thrombus, mechanical strangulation or a prolonged period of hypotension (most commonly encountered in the setting of an ITU patient). Mucosal hyperenhancement can be seen on CT as a consequence of increased permeability in the setting of a shocked bowel (other signs of shock include hyperenhancement of the adrenal glands and a slit like configuration to the inferior vena cava). Mucosal necrosis leads to oedema and haemorrhage with sloughing as the dead layer of cells falls away. Necrosis of the submucosal and muscularis layers leads to stricturing. Thumbprinting is a term derived from the appearances of a non-specifically oedematous bowel on a barium study. The same appearance on CT is less suggestive of the classic thumbprint indentations seen on fluoroscopy but the term is still used. Loss of integrity of the mucosa allows gas to enter the mesenteric vessels and thereby the portal venous system. Gas in the periphery of the liver is suggestive of portal venous gas (as opposed to aerobilia) and is a late sign of ischaemic bowel associated with a poor outcome.
The involvement of different areas of the bowel can give a clue as to the affected vessel. The watershed areas are those at the very fringes of supply from the different mesenteric arteries and are the first to be affected in low flow states.

 ",FALSE,"The most likely explanation for the findings of abdominal distension, elevation of inflammatory markers, and elevated serum lactate, as well as the CT scan findings of mucosal hyperenhancement and thumbprinting of the transverse colon and splenic flexure, is a superior mesenteric artery thrombus. This is because a thrombus in the superior mesenteric artery can cause a decrease in blood flow to the intestines, leading to ischemia and inflammation, which can cause the abdominal distension, elevated inflammatory markers, and elevated serum lactate. Additionally, the CT scan findings of mucosal hyperenhancement and thumbprinting of the transverse colon and splenic flexure are consistent with ischemia.",2,,B,FALSE,"I chose option 2, ""Superior mesenteric artery thrombus,"" as the most likely explanation for these findings because the CT scan findings of mucosal hyperenhancement and thumbprinting of the transverse colon and splenic flexure suggest ischemic colitis. Ischemic colitis occurs when blood flow to the colon is reduced, leading to inflammation and injury to the colon wall.

The superior mesenteric artery (SMA) supplies blood to a large portion of the small intestine, the cecum, and the ascending and transverse colon. A thrombus, or blood clot, in the SMA can cause a significant reduction in blood flow to these areas, leading to ischemic colitis.

The other options are less likely to be the cause of these findings:

1. Hypotension: While hypotension can cause decreased blood flow to the colon, it would not typically cause the specific CT findings mentioned.
3. Inferior mesenteric artery thrombus: A thrombus in the inferior mesenteric artery (IMA) would primarily affect the descending and sigmoid colon, not the transverse colon and splenic flexure.
4. Coeliac axis stricture: A stricture in the coeliac axis would primarily affect the stomach, liver, and spleen, not the colon.

8941,201667,You are reporting a CT scan for a 49-year-old woman. There is a cystic mass in the tail of the pancreas measuring 4HU. The cysts themselves measure around 22mm in diameter and the overall mass diameter is 120mm. The patient has a raised CEA level and results from a fine needle aspiration performed later on in the interventional suite show low amylase levels of the aspirate. What is the most likely diagnosis?,SBA: Gastrointestinal,Mucinous cystadenoma,Intraductal papillary mucinous tumour,Adenocarcinoma,Serous cystadenoma,Caroli disease,A,77%,9%,3%,10%,1%,"Explanation:
Mucinous cystadenoma
Mucinous cystadenomas of the pancreas are subject to a similar adenoma-carcinoma sequence to colonic adenomas. Left long enough, all transform into mucinous cystadenocarcinomas which have a reasonably poor prognosis. Classcially patients are middle-aged women (mean age 47years). They are also cystic tumours but whose cysts are larger than for serous cystadenomas i.e. >20mm. The overall size of the mass can be quite large, averaging at around 10cm. They have a predilection for the pancreatic tail.
  Serous cystadenoma
These are largely benign tumours which classically occur in elderly ladies in their 70s. They have a sponge like appearance where innumerable small (<20mm) cysts sit around a characteristic central scar. The tumours can be very large, and may even present as a palpable mass, but usually are around 5cm in total diameter. Although they can be found in any part of the pancreas, there is a slight predisposition for the head of the pancreas. There is usually a central scar and calcifications can sometimes be seen within the scar.

  Intraductal Papillary Mucinous Tumour (IPMT) also known as Intraductal Papillary Mucinous Neoplasm (IPMN)
IPMNs can be either branch-duct type, main-duct type or mixed. The distinction between the types is highly prognistically significant since the vast majority of branch-duct type tumours are indolent whereas the majority of main-duct type tumours are malignant. Both types are found typically in patients in their 60s and men are more commonly affected than women. The presence of cystic dilatation of all or any of the main pancreatic duct should raise the suspicion of an IPMT. Branch duct-type lesions appear as multilocular cystic masses most commonly in the head or uncinate process of the pancreas.
  Predictors of malignancy
Branch duct type
Main duct type
>4cm in overall size
Pancreatic duct >9mm in diameter
Thick, irregular septae
Mural nodule
  On ECRP, patients with a main duct type IPMN will have thick mucus bulging out of the ampulla of Vater however MRCP is generally considered the gold standard for investigation (over ERCP) since a branch duct type lesion may be missed at ERCP due to mucous plugging of the relevant duct. Anatomically there must be communication with the pancreatic ductal system even if at the time of diagnosis there is mucous plugging preventing functional drainage.
  Choledochal cyst
Reflux of pancreatic enzymes into the common bile duct leads to weakening of the wall of the common bile duct [CBD] (+/- the common hepatic duct) and thereafter aneurysmal dilatation termed a choledochal cyst. There are five different subtypes. Patients are mostly diagnosed in childhood. If undiagnosed to adulthood patients present with a triad of episodic jaundice, right upper quadrant pain and a right upper quadrant mass.
Type I – This is by far the most common version. The common bile duct is affected either focally or along its entire length.
Type II – A true diverticulum of the CBD
Type III – Focal dilatation of the CBD contained within the wall of the duodenum. This type is also called a choledochocoele. They present slightly later with most patients being in their 30s at the time of diagnosis and can be seen as a duodenal filling defect on barium follow-through studies.
Type IV – The intrahepatic and extrahepatic biliary ducts are affected
Type V – The intraheptic ducts are affected alone. This is termed Caroli disease however there is some discrepancy in the literature as to whether this can be called a type V choledochal cyst or whether it is a separate disease in its own right. Caroli disease (cavernous ectasia of the intrahepatic ducts) can be inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion. When present it is quite striking on imaging with saccular dilatation of most of the larger intrahepatic biliary ducts alongside focal strictures giving a beaded appearance. There is an association with medullary sponge kidney and patients are at significantly increased risk of developing cholangiocarcinoma.
  Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma
Unfortunately pancreatic adenocarcinoma has a poor prognosis and is also reasonably common. At the time of diagnosis only 10% have surgically resectable disease and the 5-year survival rate is pitifully low at 2-3%. The classical specific presentation is with painless jaundice (Courvoisier sign – painless jaundice and a right upper quadrant mass is unlikely to be caused by gallstones) however most patients actually present with vague abdominal or right upper quadrant pains. The tumour markers usually found are CEA and Ca19-9. Smokers, obese patients and those with a relevant oncological family history of hormonal cancers are at increased risk of developing the cancer, as are those suffering from cancer syndrome such as HNPCC (hereditary non polyposis colorectal cancer). On ultrasound the tumour will show low reflectivity compared to any adjacent normal pancreatic tissue. On CT the masses tend to enhance poorly.
The key to management is operability. Involvement of various different local structures excludes or potentially excludes some patients from surgical management as follows:
  Operable
Borderline operable
Palliative
Duodenum
Veins – IVC, SMV and Portal vein
SMA
Spleen
Arteries – aorta, splenic artery if further than 1cm from origin,

 ",TRUE,"Mucinous cystadenoma is the most likely diagnosis in this case because the cysts are large and the CEA level is elevated. Additionally, the fine needle aspiration results showed low amylase levels, which is consistent with a mucinous cystadenoma.",2,,A,TRUE,"I chose option 5, Mucinous cystadenoma, based on the information provided in the question. The cystic mass in the tail of the pancreas with a low attenuation value (4HU) and a large diameter (120mm) is consistent with a cystic lesion. The patient also has a raised CEA (carcinoembryonic antigen) level, which is often associated with mucinous tumors.

The fine needle aspiration results show low amylase levels in the aspirate, which makes it less likely to be a pseudocyst or a serous cystadenoma (option 3). Intraductal papillary mucinous tumors (option 1) typically involve the pancreatic ducts and may have higher amylase levels. Adenocarcinoma (option 2) usually presents as a solid mass rather than a cystic lesion. Caroli disease (option 4) is a rare congenital condition characterized by cystic dilatation of the intrahepatic bile ducts, which is not consistent with the findings in this case.

Therefore, based on the clinical and radiological findings, the most likely diagnosis is a Mucinous cystadenoma.",A,TRUE,A
11856,201667,A 13-year-old boy with recurrent epistaxis has a CT scan which shows a highly vascular mass in the nasopharynx causing widening of the pterygopalatine fossa and sphenopalatine foramen as well as sphenoid sinus invasion. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?,SBA: Paediatrics,Juvenile angiofibroma,Antrochoanal polyp,Inverted papilloma,Mucocoele,Squamous cell carcinoma,A,96%,1%,2%,0%,1%,"Explanation:
This is the classic description of a juvenile angiofibroma, if the demographic hasn’t already given the answer away. They are vascular tumours and interventionalists have a significant role to play in their management. They are supplied by the internal maxillary artery and ascending pharyngeal artery. Care must be taken during embolisation not to affect any branches from the internal maxillary artery which go on to supply the eye in order not to cause blindness. Classically these tumours cause erosion of the medial pterygoid plate and are seen on MRI as flow voids on T2w. Of the other answers an inverted papilloma would cause a degree of bony destruction, an SCC would show aggressive features and would be unlikely given the demographic. A mucocoele would be found within a sinus and classically shows an absence of air in that sinus in contrast to an antrochoanal polyp where the sinus is often incompletely opacified.
 ",TRUE,"I chose Juvenile Angiofibroma as the most likely diagnosis because it is the most common cause of recurrent epistaxis in adolescent males.

Lunotriquetral
Injury to this ligament results in VISI.
Injury to this ligament also causes midcarpal dislocation (similar to lunate dislocation and also associate with triquetral fractures).
  Scapholunate
Injury to the scapholunate ligaments results in SLAC and DISI (which is more common than VISI).
  Dorsal Radiolunate
Lunate dislocation occurs secondary to a dorsal radiolunate injury.
  Capitolunate
Injury to this ligament is associated with perilunate dislocation.",FALSE,"The scapholunate ligament is the most likely ligament to have been injured in this case of volar intercalated segmental instability (VISI). This is because VISI is characterised by widening of the scapholunate angle and narrowing of the capitolunate angle, both of which can be seen on the radiographs.

The Scapholunate ligament connects the scaphoid and lunate bones in the wrist and helps maintain the stability of the carpal bones. When this ligament is injured, it can result in an abnormal alignment of the wrist bones, leading to the characteristic changes seen on radiographs, such as narrowing of the scapholunate angle and an increased capitolunate angle. This altered alignment can cause pain and instability in the wrist, as described in the patient's presentation.",B,TRUE,A
14928,201667,"A 51-year-old lady is screened for breast cancer as part of the NHS breast screening service. A lesion is seen, and the patient is recalled for further magnified views. Which views should be taken?","SBA: Genito urinary, Adrenal, Obstetrics & Gynaecology and Breast",CC and lateral,MLO and CC,MLO and lateral,"Lateral, MLO and CC",Lateral only,A,30%,25%,5%,19%,21%,"Explanation:
MLO and CC are the standard views performed at screening.
If further views are required these are usually decided on a case-by-case basis.
Of the answers provided:
MLO and CC - the screening views, no point in repeating with no change
MLO and lateral - the lateral would be useful, the MLO would not add anything
Lateral, MLO and CC - if the CC was rolled then the lateral and the rolled CC would be useful but the MLO is superfluous
Lateral only - this would be most useful if the mass had suspected teacup calcifications.
  A lateral and a rolled-CC would be most useful to evaluate this patient further. The question unfortunately does not specify either way whether this answer intends the patient to undergo a rolled CC view however the reasons against the other answers are detailed above.
A true lateral view can help demonstrate suspected teacup calcifications are teacup calcifications. Compression views are used to interrogate suspicious calcifications seen on mammograms further.
A rolled CC view can help separate out structures to prove that the 'mass' seen on the original mammogram was a summation shadow, or to confirm the presence of a mass.
  Teacup calcifications
Teacup calcifications are caused by liquid milk of calcium within fibrocystic change. On mammography they appear as small curvilinear thin calcifications resembling the fluid level in a teacup on lateral views and rounded on a craniocaudal view, like a teacup viewed from above. Although teacup calcifications are typically benign in nature and suggestive of only fibrocystic changes they must be distinguished from suspicious calcifications. Thus the best views for confirming the presence of teacup calcifications would be a true lateral, as opposed to an oblique lateral, and a CC view. Granted the CC view should already have been performed during screening but the point of this question is essentially ‘what are the best views with which to see teacup calcification’. In practice if views are being repeated, they would be as magnified views of an area of interest.",FALSE,"The views that should be taken for further magnified views of the lesion are the MLO (mediolateral oblique) and lateral views.

9671,201667,A 15-year-old boy is referred to the paediatric services at his local hospital having complained of a sore knee for the last few months. An x-ray is requested which shows a 3.2cm lytic lesion within the proximal tibial epiphysis. It has a thin sclerotic rim. What is the most likely diagnosis?,SBA: Paediatrics,Chondroblastoma,Brodie abscess,Osteoid osteoma,Osteoblastoma,Enchondroma,A,61%,18%,3%,13%,5%,"Explanation:
Chondroblastoma
Largely speaking these tumours only arise in epiphyses or epiphyseal equivalent bones (such as the patella) and are therefore confined, in-terms of age, to children or adolescents. They can present in a fairly indolent fashion with pain, swelling and tenderness preceding diagnosis by weeks, if not months. They typically occur in the long bones, around two thirds are found in the leg and half are found around the knee. On x-ray they appear as a lucent, lobulated lesion with a thin sclerotic margin. Surrounding oedema, if present, can be surprisingly florid, even leading to an overestimation of the extent of the underlying lesion. Calcification associated with the lesion does occur but is better appreciated with CT.
  Brodie abscess
The best explanation of these abscesses is of a smoldering osteomyelitis. Most commonly they are caused by staphylococcus aureus (or Salmonella in patients with sickle cell disease) and in children they arise in the metaphyses and the presence of the growth plate acts as a physical barrier hindering spread to the epiphyses. In very young children (<18 months) there are blood vessels traversing the growth plate and thus abscesses can form in both the metaphyses and the epiphyses. In patients where the growth plates have fused, vessel cross the site of the old growth plate and the epiphysis can become infected.
Age
Site of infection
<18m
Metaphysis + epiphysis
>18m – before fusion of growth plate
Metaphysis
 After fusion of growth plate
Epiphysis
  On x-ray a lucent lesion with a sclerotic margin should raise the possibility of a Brodie abscess and the presence of a lucent channel extending towards the growth plate is considered pathognomonic. The diagnosis is usually confirmed with MRI where the sclerotic bone returns little signal on T2 weighted sequences but the adjacent inner granulation tissue returns high signal. The combination of the two is referred to as the ‘double-line’ effect. The rim of granulation tissue can enhance with gadolinium but the absence of enhancement does not rule the condition out. Adjacent bone marrow is often oedematous (high on T2, low on T1).
  Osteoid osteoma
These are small benign tumours but which can be quite symptomatic, classically with pain relieved by aspirin. The majority form in the diaphyses of long bones but the posterior elements of the spine is another classic location.
The radiolucent nidus and symptoms of night pain in a young patient point to either an osteoid osteoma or an osteoblastoma. The final diagnosis comes down to size: <1.5 cm is definitely an osteoid osteoma, and >2 cm is definitely an osteoblastoma. There is a nasty grey area somewhere between the two sizes.
On x-ray the radiolucent nidus may not be fully appreciated and the abnormality which is picked up will be the consequential sclerotic solid periosteal reaction. In the spine there may be a painful scoliosis concave towards the lesion as a result of adjacent muscular spasm. CT is used to confirm the diagnosis as the nidus is readily appreciable.
  Osteoblastoma
Osteoblastomas are quite rare, even for bone tumours. To all intent and purposes they can be considered as large osteoid osteomas. They occur in slightly older patients than osteoid osteomas but most patients are still under 30-years-old. Around a third arise in the posterior elements of the spine, sometimes giving a painful scoliosis, a further third can be found in the long bones and roughly the remaining third arise in the small bones of the hands and feet.
  Enchondroma
As the name suggests, this is a cartilage forming tumour showing ground-glass matrix and ring or arc calcifications (as with all cartilage forming tumours). Patients are typically young (10-30 years) and the lesions are typically found in the hands (although they can form anywhere in the body. In the hands they are unusual to be found in the terminal phalanges). They are thought to derive from ongoing growth of small foci of cartilage which have become displaced from the growth plate. They can expand the cortex but, unless presenting as a fracture, should be painless and therefore are often an incidental diagnosis. Although they are benign tumours, malignant degeneration to a chondrosarcoma can occur.",FALSE,"Osteoid osteoma is the most likely diagnosis for this 15-year-old boy based on the description of the x-ray results. Osteoid osteomas are benign bone tumors that typically occur in children and young adults. They are characterized by a lytic lesion with a thin sclerotic rim, which is what was observed in this case.

11756,201667,A baby born suddenly at 28 weeks due to placental abruption develops respiratory distress. He is intubated and ventilated and transferred to a neonatal intensive care unit. A CXR performed later that day shows patchy ground glass opacification in a bilateral symmetrical distribution with air bronchograms present.  What is the most likely diagnosis?,SBA: Paediatrics,Hyaline membrane disease,Transient tachypnoea of the newborn,Meconium aspiration,Pulmonary interstitial emphysema,Bronchopulmonary dysplasia,A,82%,5%,3%,6%,4%,"Explanation:
Of the five main respiratory conditions of the neonate the differential diagnosis can be narrowed based on gestational age.  The presence of hyperinflation can also be useful but may not always be present where feasible so should not be used as an absolute discriminator. If present, it is useful.
Meconium aspiration
Meconium is sticky and causes a chemical pneumonitis in the lungs, seen as patchy consolidation. In addition small globules of meconium entering bronchi and bronchioles of a decreasing calibre act as a ball-valve mechanism and lead to air trapping; thus the lung volumes of a baby with meconium aspiration may be increased. Air bronchograms are notably absent. The typical baby in a meconium aspiration situation is post-term.
  Transient tachypnoea of the newborn (TTN)
The classical patient for TTN would be a term baby born by caesarean section to a diabetic mother. During normal vaginal delivery the compression of the baby as it descends the birth canal acts to squeeze fluid out from its lungs. This mechanism is all but absent during a caesarean section.  Consequently these babies are born with an excess of retained fluid. The CXR of an affected baby will show bilateral symmetrical air space opacification with air bronchograms, fluid in the fissures and pleural effusions. This peaks in severity at 24hrs but resolves by three days.
  Hyaline Membrane Disease (HMD) also known as surfactant deficient disease (SDD)
It is to reduce the likelihood of this disease developing that a woman in pre-term labour will be offered a steroid injection. The steroids help the neonatal lungs to develop faster and increase the likelihood of their being able to produce surfactant once delivered. Where there is surfactant deficiency the alveoli collapse. The CXR will show a granular opacification throughout both lungs which progresses to bilateral ground glass opacification with air bronchograms. If exogenous surfactant is given to the baby there may be asymmetrical improvement in the appearances depending on how much reaches each lung. Of note HMD does not cause pleural effusions. Finally a normal CXR at 6hrs post delivery excludes HMD.
  Pulmonary interstitial emphysema (PIE)
As the name would suggest, this disease is diagnosed when there is air within the interstitial tissues of the lungs. It is caused by alveolar rupture due to the barotrauma of mechanical ventilation or positive airway pressure.  It can be associated with hyaline membrane disease and is prevalent in infants of a low birth weight. Complications such as pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum can be severe and acutely life threatening. Radiographically there is hyperinflation and lucencies in either a cystic pattern or streaks emanating from the hila and following the direction of the bronchi/bronchioles. It is treated with high frequency oscillation ventilation which is less traumatic to the lungs.
  Bronchopulmonary dysplasia
This also occurs due to barotrauma in ventilated neonates but is a more gradual process, occurring later on in the baby’s life. Typically (but not exclusively) the baby is premature (hence requiring ventilation). It only usually occurs after the baby in question has received ventilation of >21% oxygen for longer than 28 days. The lungs are hyperinflated and what starts off as ground glass opacification becomes complete opacification with air bronchograms in a few days. After 30 days it can be seen as coarse linear lucencies, described as radiating from the hila, with focal emphysematous change. Mikity syndrome has similar features but occurs in term infants who have not received mechanical assistance.",TRUE,"I chose Hyaline Membrane Disease because it is a common cause of respiratory distress in premature babies. It is caused by immature lungs, which are unable to produce enough surfactant, leading to poor oxygenation and collapse of the alveoli. The CXR findings of patchy ground glass opacification with air bronchograms are consistent with this diagnosis.",2,"The question falls under category 2: A question about clinical judgement, what is the correct diagnosis?",A,TRUE,"I chose option 3, Hyaline Membrane Disease (HMD), because the clinical scenario and the findings on the chest X-ray are most consistent with this diagnosis. HMD, also known as Respiratory Distress Syndrome (RDS), is a common cause of respiratory distress in premature infants, particularly those born before 32 weeks of gestation. The baby in this case was born prematurely at 28 weeks due to placental abruption, which puts the baby at a higher risk for HMD.

The chest X-ray findings of patchy ground-glass opacification in a bilateral symmetrical distribution with air bronchograms are classic for HMD. This appearance is due to the lack of surfactant in the immature lungs, leading to alveolar collapse and atelectasis. Surfactant deficiency results in poor lung compliance, making it difficult for the baby to breathe, and necessitating intubation and ventilation, as described in the clinical scenario.

The other options are less likely in this case:

1. Transient tachypnea of the newborn (TTN) typically occurs in term or near-term infants and is characterized by rapid breathing due to delayed clearance of fetal lung fluid. The chest X-ray findings in TTN usually show fluid in the fissures and prominent perihilar streakiness, which is different from the findings described in this case.

2. Meconium aspiration usually occurs in term or post-term infants, and the chest X-ray findings include patchy infiltrates and hyperinflation, which are not consistent with the described findings in this case.

4. Pulmonary interstitial emphysema (PIE) is a complication of mechanical ventilation and is characterized by the presence of air in the pulmonary interstitium. The chest X-ray findings in PIE include cystic lucencies, which are not described in this case.

5. Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a chronic lung disease that affects premature infants who have been treated with oxygen and mechanical ventilation. BPD usually develops after several weeks of life, and the chest X-ray findings include hyperinflation and coarse interstitial markings. The clinical scenario and X-ray findings in this case do not match BPD.",A,FALSE,D
14460,201667,The renal arteries arise from the aorta at which vertebral level? Select ONE answer only.,"SBA: Genito urinary, Adrenal, Obstetrics & Gynaecology and Breast",L2,L1,L3,L4,L5,A,62%,29%,8%,1%,0%,"Explanation:
The arterial supply to the kidneys is from the renal arteries, two fast flowing arteries that arise from the abdominal aorta at the L2 vertebral level. As the abdominal aorta is situated slightly to the left of the midline the right renal artery is longer than the left. The kidneys receive approximately 20% of the cardiac output.
After arising from the aorta, the right renal artery passes behind the inferior vena cava, the right renal vein, the head of the pancreas, and the second part of the duodenum as it travels to the kidney. The left renal artery passes behind the left renal vein, the body of the pancreas and the splenic vein as it travels to the kidney. The left renal artery is crossed anteriorly by the inferior mesenteric vein.
The renal arteries then enter the kidney at the hila of the kidneys, which lie approximately in the transpyloric plane at the L1 vertebral level. At the hila the renal arteries divide into four or five segmental branches.
Each segmental branch divides to form the interlobar arteries that are situated on either side of every renal pyramid. These interlobar arteries then undergo further division to form the arcuate arteries.
The interlobular arteries are then given off at right angles from the side of the arcuate arteries, and head into the cortical substance. Once within the cortex a final division takes place with the interlobular arteries dividing to form the efferent arterioles.
In the outer two-thirds of the cortex, the efferent arterioles form the peritubular network. The inner third of the cortex is supplied by long, straight arteries known as the vasa recta.

Which of the following findings would you expect to allow you to make the diagnosis?","SBA: Genito urinary, Adrenal, Obstetrics & Gynaecology and Breast",Reversed diastolic flow,Increased resistive index,Decreased resistive index,Tardus-parvus pulse,Peak systolic velocity >150 cm/s,A,81%,11%,1%,5%,1%,"Explanation:
An increased resistive index is a sensitive finding for the presence of pathology but it is relatively non-specific.
  Renal vein thrombosis
Transplant kidneys are most likely to develop renal vein thrombosis within their first week. Clinically the patient will become anuric with a tender and swollen kidney. Ultrasound is the mainstay of diagnosis and can show thrombus within the renal vein, however the diagnosis is usually made on the basis of the Doppler findings. Since the outflow from the kidney is obstructed the resistive index (the difference in velocity between systole and diastole divided by the systolic velocity) will increase to above 0.7. The resistive index, however, is not specific as it also increases in renal artery stenosis. Furthermore the arterial waveform changes and there may even be reversal of end-diastolic flow in the renal artery. This is seen as inversion of the colour Doppler trace.
  Renal artery stenosis
There are three main aetiologies of renal artery stenosis. The most prevalent is atherosclerosis. Fibromuscular dysplasia is the second most common and is classically given as affecting a relatively young woman with beading (string of beads) of the mid and distal renal arteries seen, for which the management is angioplasty. Finally a small number of cases are secondary to a variety of conditions such as Buerger’s disease, Takayasu’s disease and neurofibromatosis.
The significance of diagnosis of atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis is in avoiding the use of ACE inhibitors. The ASTRAL trial showed that there was no long term benefit of stenting the stenoses over best medical management, although there was still a reduction in the number of episodes of flash pulmonary oedema experienced by the patients.

 ",FALSE,"The peak systolic velocity >150 cm/s is a reliable indicator of renal vein thrombosis in transplanted kidneys. This is because the peak systolic velocity is the highest velocity of blood flow through the renal vein and is usually lower than 150 cm/s in normal kidneys.

This question falls under category 2: a question about clinical judgement, what is the correct diagnosis?",E,TRUE,"I chose option 3, ""Reversed diastolic flow,"" because it is a characteristic finding in renal vein thrombosis on Doppler ultrasound. Renal vein thrombosis occurs when a blood clot forms in the renal vein, which can lead to impaired blood flow and compromised kidney function.

In a normal kidney, the diastolic flow in the renal vein is forward (toward the heart). However, in the case of renal vein thrombosis, the blood flow is obstructed by the clot, causing the diastolic flow to reverse direction. This reversed diastolic flow can be detected using Doppler ultrasound, which measures the velocity and direction of blood flow within the vessels. This finding, along with other clinical and imaging features, can help confirm the diagnosis of renal vein thrombosis.",A,TRUE,A

  Hepatoblastoma
Most hepatoblastomas are found in children under the age of 3 but they can occur at any point in childhood. They are the third most common abdominal tumour in children. Presentation is typically with an abdominal mass and weight loss and the serum AFP is often markedly elevated. Some may produce hormones and thereby precocious puberty but this is rare. Coarse calcification is seen in around a third of cases. On ultrasound the mass will be large and heterogenous. On CT they appear as a predominantly low attenuation mass seeming to consist of multiple confluent nodules. Often the rim of the mass enhances well on CT. On MRI they are, for the most part, high in signal on T2 weighted sequences but can show low intensity fibrous bands running through them.
  Infantile haemangioendothelioma
These are benign lesions which can cause elevation of the serum AFP but the vast majority occur in babies under the age of 6 months. Around half of cases are associated with the presence of a cutaneous haemangioma. They are large vascular tumours and on imaging behave as might be expected of a haemangioma with low echogenicity on ultrasound, peripheral enhancement with gradual filling in on CT and flow voids on MRI. Calcifications can be seen with these lesions but they are finer, more granular calcifications; not coarse. Owing to their size they often cause significant right to left shunting of blood resulting in congestive heart failure. Thrombocytopaenia due to platelet trapping (known as the Kasabach-Merritt sequence). N.B. these lesions should not be confused with epithelioid haemangioendotheliomas which occur in adults.
  Wilms tumour also known as a nephroblastoma
This is the most common abdominal mass in children under the age of 8. There are reasonably strong associations with renal anomalies, genital anomalies, aniridia and Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (although the last of these also has an association with neuroblastoma). Presentation is usually with an abdominal mass and/or pain.
10% tumour – Wilms
Calcification
Vascular invasion
Bilateral
Lung metastases
Poor histology
  On imaging the masses are usually heterogenous. Cystic areas can often be seen secondary to areas of necrosis. The claw sign occurs when there is a rim of normal renal tissue extending part of the way around the mass. A Wilms tumour is often described as enhancing but less so than the adjacent normal renal parenchyma.
  Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) also known as Hepatoma
There is a peak in the incidence of HCCs in the paediatric age range at around age 13. The central scar of an HCC is a specific feature which can help separate it from potential differential diagnoses. Although calcification of this central scar is seen in around a quarter of cases there tends to be less calcification in HCCs than there would be in a hepatoblastoma.
Although metastases are the most common cause of malignant hepatic lesions, hepatocellular carcinoma is the most common primary hepatic malignancy. It usually arises on a background of cirrhosis of any cause. Patients with any of the hepatitis viruses, alcoholic cirrhosis, haemochromatosis, and Wilson disease are all at risk. Carcinogens such as thorotrast and aflatoxin also predispose to HCC formation. Serum alpha fetoprotein levels are often raised, in contrast with cholangiocarcinomas which are one of the main differential diagnoses.
On imaging HCCs can have a variety of appearances. A large irregular mass with satellite nodules is the most common finding but a diffuse infiltrative version can also occur. Since HCCs derive their blood supply from the hepatic artery they show arterial enhancement on CT with washout on later phases. On ultrasound HCCs tend to be hyperechoic when compared to the rest of the liver and on MRI they show variable signal intensity on both T1 and T2 but arterial enhancement with venous washout can again be seen once Gadolinium has been given.
  Hepatic abscess
Liver abscesses can occur in children, for much the same reasons as they arise in adults, although they are far more common in adults. Pyogenic abscesses result from bacteria accessing the liver via the biliary tree, septicaemia, direct spread, trauma or during a liver procedure. Patients are usually in their 60s. Amoebic abscesses occur in slightly younger patients (40s) and tend to result from spread of amoebae from the colon via the portal venous system. On ultrasound they appear as a hypoechoic mass with posterior acoustic enhancement. Internal debris may be apparent. On CT they are usually low in attenuation with rim enhancement. MRI signal characteristics are dependent on the protein content of the pus but usually abscesses return little T1 signal and, owing to their fluid nature, return high signal on T2 weighted sequences. It is said that amoebic abscesses are usually found to be contiguous with the liver capsule.",TRUE,"The most likely diagnosis based on the given information is hepatoblastoma. This is because the elevated serum AFP level, the presence of a mass in the right lobe of the liver, and the high signal on T2 with low intensity bands running through it are all consistent with hepatoblastoma.",2,,A,TRUE,"I chose Hepatoblastoma as the most likely diagnosis for the following reasons:

1. Patient's age: Hepatoblastoma is the most common primary liver tumor in children, typically affecting children under the age of 5. The patient in this case is a 6-year-old girl, which falls within the typical age range for this tumor.

2. Elevated serum AFP level: An increase in serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) is a common finding in patients with hepatoblastoma. This tumor marker is often used to monitor the response to treatment and for detecting recurrence.

3. Imaging findings: The presence of a mass in the right lobe of the liver with coarse calcification on CT scan and high signal intensity on T2-weighted MRI images with some low-intensity bands are consistent with the imaging features of hepatoblastoma.

The other options listed are less likely due to the patient's age, elevated AFP levels, and the specific imaging findings:

- Hepatic abscess: This condition is typically associated with fever, pain, and leukocytosis. The imaging findings would likely show a fluid-filled cavity with peripheral enhancement, which is not described in this case.
- Wilms tumor: This is a kidney tumor and would not present as a liver mass.
- Haemangioendothelioma: This is a rare vascular tumor that can occur in the liver, but it typically presents with multiple nodules and is not associated with elevated AFP levels.

Lymphoma
This is the most common anterior mediastinal mass in children. It may be difficult to differentiate a lymphoma from normal thymus, particularly in a patient younger than 10 years of age. Associated lymphadenopathy (i.e. cervical) can be the key to distinguishing the two pathologies. Calcification is rare prior to any treatment but can be a feature of lymphoma which has been treated.
  Germ Cell Tumour
This often causes a large anterior mediastinal mass. It can be subdivided into Teratoma (usually cystic with fat and calcification), seminoma (bulky and lobulated) and Non-seminomatous Germ Cell Tumour (haemorrhage and necrosis).

These heterogenous tumours are part of the Ewing Sarcoma spectrum. Patients are often in their early teens. Askin tumours displace rather than invade adjacent mediastinal structures although rib destruction is common and is a fact which can help distinguish it from a pleuropulmonary blastoma which is another cause of a large mediastinal mass, albeit usually found in babies under the age of 2, but which does not cause rib destruction.",FALSE,"Germ cell tumours are the most common type of anterior mediastinal mass in children and adolescents. They typically have a lobulated outline, with no invasion of adjacent structures, and enlarged lymph nodes in the included cervical chains. They can also have no calcification, fat, or haemorrhage within the mass. These features are consistent with the description of the mass in this case, making germ cell tumour the most likely diagnosis.",2,,A,TRUE,"I chose option 2, Lymphoma, because the description of the CT findings matches the typical characteristics of a lymphoma. The large, lobulated anterior mediastinal mass with enlarged cervical lymph nodes indicates a possible malignant process, which is consistent with lymphoma. The absence of calcification, fat, or hemorrhage within the mass further supports this diagnosis. 

The other options are less likely based on the given information:
1. Normal thymus: A normal thymus would not present as a large mass with enlarged cervical lymph nodes.
3. Germ cell tumour: While germ cell tumors can occur in the mediastinum, they often have calcification or fat within the mass, which is not mentioned in this case.
4. Duplication cyst: Duplication cysts are typically well-defined cystic lesions, not large lobulated masses with enlarged lymph nodes.
5. Askin Tumour: Askin Tumour, a type of primitive neuroectodermal tumor, is a rare and aggressive malignancy. While it could present as a mediastinal mass, the absence of invasion of adjacent structures makes it less likely in this case.",A,TRUE,A
13910,201667,A 70-year-old man undergoes an MRI scan of the base of his skull. He has previously undergone surgery for a left sided cholesteatoma and the surgeon is concerned there may be a recurrence. Within the surgical cavity on the left there is a mass which does not enhance on the post-contrast sequences but does restrict diffusion. What is the most likely diagnosis? Select ONE answer only.,SBA: Central Nervous and Head & Neck,Recurrent cholesteatoma,Post-operative fluid,Granulation tissue,Otitis media,Cholesterol granuloma,A,75%,2%,11%,4%,8%,"Explanation:
Cholesteatomas are difficult to manage as they have a high recurrence rate. Imaging has a significant role to play in the management of recurrent cholesteatomas; distinguishing recurrence from post-operative granulation tissue or fluid is important.
  Diagnosis Restricts Diffusion Enhances
Recurrent cholesteatoma Yes No
Granulation tissue No Yes
Fluid No No
  Post-contrast sequences for recurrent cholesteatomas require a delay of around 45 minutes from giving the contrast to acquiring images as the granulation tissue is slow to take up contrast. This has obvious down-sides to any modern day busy MRI schedule. However since the management of post-operative granulation tissue and post-operative fluid is largely identical, namely expectant, it is not important to differentiate the one from the other. Thus findings on diffusion weighted sequences are the most important thing in post-operative cholesteatoma imaging.
  Cholesteatoma
Cholesteatomas (Acquired or congenital) are histolologically epidermoid cysts. On imaging the finding of non-dependant soft tissue and bony erosion within the middle ear is typical for a cholesteatoma.
There are two types of acquired cholesteatoma:
Pars flaccida (80%) – classically erodes the scutum and extends superiorly
Pars tensa (20%) – classically erodes the ossicles, extending medially
  These refer to the two parts of the tympanic membrane from which they arise.
  Image © Medical Exam Prep
  In due course, if left unattended, a cholesteatoma will expand to fill the entire middle ear. Prior to this point they can be seen as non-dependant soft tissue within the middle ear. Dependant soft tissue within the middle ear suggests the presence of fluid or pus and the diagnosis of a middle ear infection. Once a cholesteatoma has filled the middle ear completely however no gas remains from which to discern dependency.
There are a number of theories as to how cholesteatomas arise. One theory is that following a perforation of the tympanic membrane entry of desquamated stratified keratinised squamous epithelium from the external auditory canal into the middle ear is permitted. There it adheres to the tympanic membrane and proliferates unrelentingly causing a soft tissue mass to form and eventually leading to bony erosion of the ossicles, scutum and/or other parts of the middle ear.
A congenital cholesteatoma behaves in a similar manner but is present from birth due to an aberrant location of a tiny island of keratinised squamous epithelium.
  Cholesterol granuloma
A cholesterol granuloma occurs as a sequela of recurrent bouts of otitis media. Haemorrhage within the middle ear leads to the formation of granulation tissue. On imaging this is seen as non-specification of the middle ear on CT. Bony changes can occur chronically with bony expansion, or displacement and even destruction of the ossicles. The signals characteristics on MRI are therefore important to distinguish it from a cholesteatoma. Whereas a cholesteatoma on MRI is isointense to brain parenchyma on T1, a cholesterol granuloma will show high signal in the middle ear on T1 due to the paramagnetic effects of methaemoglobin. On clinical examination the ENT surgeon may report a bulging blue tympanic membrane. This is classical. Dehiscence of the jugular bulb is an important differential diagnosis to exclude as this will also give a blue tympanic membrane on examination but the management is radically different!",TRUE,"I chose this answer because a cholesteatoma is a type of benign tumor that is characterized by abnormal skin growth in the middle ear, which can lead to recurrent infections and hearing loss. The MRI scan showed a mass that did not enhance on post-contrast sequences but did restrict diffusion, which is consistent with the characteristics of a cholesteatoma.",2,,A,TRUE,"I chose option 4, ""Recurrent cholesteatoma,"" because the clinical history and MRI findings are consistent with this diagnosis. The patient has a history of surgery for a left-sided cholesteatoma, and the surgeon is concerned about a possible recurrence. Cholesteatoma is a noncancerous growth of skin cells in the middle ear or mastoid, which can cause complications if left untreated.

The MRI findings mentioned in the question, such as a mass within the surgical cavity that does not enhance on post-contrast sequences but does restrict diffusion, are characteristic of cholesteatomas. Restricted diffusion is a key feature of cholesteatomas, as they contain keratin debris and desquamated epithelial cells, which lead to high cellularity and restricted water diffusion. This feature helps differentiate cholesteatomas from other potential diagnoses, such as fluid collections or granulation tissue, which typically do not show restricted diffusion.",A,FALSE,B
9121,201667,A baby boy with Down syndrome born at term develops persistent vomiting within a few hours of his birth. He undergoes an abdominal x-ray which shows a dilated and gas-filled stomach as well as air in the duodenal bulb but a total absence of gas in the small or large bowel. What is the most likely diagnosis?,SBA: Paediatrics,Duodenal atresia,Pyloric stenosis,Gastro-oesophageal reflux,Biliary atresia,Annular pancreas,A,91%,1%,0%,2%,6%,"Explanation:
Duodenal atresia
This should be considered as a diagnosis in any young baby with upper GI symptoms. The x-ray will show no gas in the distal bowel but, counterintuitively, there is often aerobilia if the Sphincter of Oddi is proximal to the atrophic part. When there is air in both the stomach and proximal duodenum on an x-ray it is referred to as the double-bubble sign. There is a reasonably strong association with Down syndrome: around a quarter of cases of duodenal atresia will have Down syndrome.
  Annular pancreas
When the head and uncinate process of the pancreas (ventral pancreas) fail to migrate satisfactorily during embryological development they can fuse with the rest of the pancreas and encircle the duodenum. Around half of patients are diagnosed in childhood although the condition can remain asymptomatic and be picked up incidentally. In the neonatal period symptoms fit with duodenal obstruction and the classic ‘double bubble’ can be seen on fluoroscopy where contrast media can flow through the pylorus into the D1 segment of the duodenum but no further. Most cases are associated with other congenital abnormalities such as trache-oesophageal fistula, malrotation or atresia of the duodenum or oesophagus, and Down syndrome (i.e. single palmar crease, Brushfield spots) is also an associated syndrome. An annular pancreas is likely to present slightly later than duodenal atresia and often there are traces of gas seen distally, unlike for duodenal atresia.
  Pyloric stenosis
This tends to present within a few weeks of birth with projectile non-bilious vomiting. The hypertrophied pylorus can often be felt as an olive-shaped mass on abdominal palpation and its appearance on imaging gives rise to numerous different signs (Caterpillar sign, shoulder sign, beak sign, diamond sign, double track sign, mushroom sign and string sign). Of these, the string sign (a narrow track of barium passing through a long pyloric canal) is said to be the most specific. Importantly, a normal abdominal radiograph does not exclude the diagnosis. Ultrasound is the most useful test to perform and the main differential diagnosis on clinical grounds is of reflux.
Pyloric stenosis (approximate numbers)
Pyloric length
>15mm
Pyloric thickness
3mm (one side)
7mm (both sides + the middle)
Pyloric volume

  Biliary atresia
This presents between two weeks and two months of life as an obstructive jaundice picture (i.e. conjugated hyperbilirubinaemia). The extrahepatic bile ducts have become fibrosed and cause obstruction. Initial investigation is usually with ultrasound and an echogenic ‘triangular cord’ structure in the porta hepatitis is considered pathognomic. The gallbladder may be normal, small or non-visualised and therefore contributes little to the diagnosis. Further investigation is often with a HIDA scan. If there normal activity within the liver (usually after only a few minutes) but there is no visualisation of tracer within the bowel after 24 hours this is considered diagnostic. Phenobarbitol can be given in the days leading up to the scan to increase biliary output.
  Reflux
This is a common problem which should be diagnosed clinically.",FALSE,"Pyloric stenosis is the most likely diagnosis because the abdominal X-ray showed a dilated and gas-filled stomach, air in the duodenal bulb, and a total absence of gas in the small or large bowel. Pyloric stenosis is a condition in which the pylorus, the opening between the stomach and small intestine, is narrowed, which prevents stomach contents from passing into the small intestine. This can cause persistent vomiting and can be confirmed with an abdominal X-ray.",2,,B,TRUE,"I chose option 1, Duodenal atresia, because the clinical presentation and the x-ray findings are consistent with this diagnosis. 

In a baby with Down syndrome, the risk of gastrointestinal malformations such as duodenal atresia is increased. Duodenal atresia is a congenital condition in which there is a complete or partial obstruction of the duodenum due to the absence or incomplete development of a portion of the duodenum. This leads to the inability of stomach contents to pass through the duodenum and into the rest of the small intestine.

The clinical presentation of persistent vomiting within a few hours of birth is also consistent with duodenal atresia, as the obstruction prevents the passage of gastric contents, leading to vomiting.

The abdominal x-ray findings of a dilated and gas-filled stomach, air in the duodenal bulb, but a total absence of gas in the small or large bowel are classic signs of duodenal atresia. This is often described as a ""double bubble"" sign, which is the appearance of two air-filled bubbles representing the stomach and the proximal duodenum. The absence of gas in the distal bowel indicates that there is an obstruction in the proximal gastrointestinal tract, which is consistent with duodenal atresia.",A,TRUE,A
11991,201667,A 15-year-old boy presents with painless bilateral swellings to the parotid glands. USS shows these to be cystic lesions and there are associated lymph nodes bilaterally too.

Differentiating this from sarcoid is difficult. Sjogrens can present as diffuse bilateral painless parotid enlargement but the associated lymph nodes would be more likely to be intraparotid than cervical.
HIV parotitis is what is being described. Interestingly parotid involvement is a good prognostic feature for children with HIV. The lymph nodes are typically in the posterior triangle of the neck with HIV parotitis.
Warthin tumour is indolent and unlikely to be associated with lymph nodes.",FALSE,"I chose Warthin tumour as the best explanation for this because Warthin tumour is the most common benign tumour of the parotid gland and is typically seen in middle-aged and elderly men, although it can occur in younger individuals. It is characterized by bilateral, painless, cystic swellings in the parotid glands and associated lymph nodes.",2,"3. A question regarding ethical considerations.

This question would fall under category 2: A question about clinical judgement, what is the correct diagnosis?",C,TRUE,"I chose option 2, HIV, because the patient's presentation of painless bilateral parotid gland swellings with associated lymph nodes and cystic lesions on ultrasound is consistent with the clinical manifestations of HIV infection. HIV can cause parotid gland enlargement due to benign lymphoepithelial cysts and generalized lymphadenopathy, which is a common feature of HIV infection. The age of the patient and the absence of other symptoms make HIV a more likely cause compared to the other options.",B,FALSE,C
12011,201667,A 67-year-old man is admitted following a stroke. He undergoes an MRI scan which shows high DWI signal and low ADC in the fronto-parietal lobe as well as high DWI and high ADC signal in the medial posterior temporal lobe.  Which of the following combinations best explains these findings?,SBA: Central Nervous and Head & Neck,Acute MCA and old PCA infarct,Acute PCA infarct and old ACA infarct,Acute PCA infarct and old MCA infarct,Acute ACA infarct and old MCA infarct,Acute MCA infarct and old ACA infarct,A,72%,1%,2%,18%,8%,"Explanation:
Acute infarctions are seen as bright areas on DWI with a corresponding low signal area on the ADC map, however in the 7-15 days following a stroke there is first pseudonormalisation and then reversal of the ADC signal. This occurs as cerebral necrosis and the increased water content of the affected tissue gives rise to t2 shine through effect. The medial posterior temporal lobe is a slightly clumsily worded anatomical location. Largely speaking if the brain tissue is adjacent to the falx it is NOT supplied by the MCA.",FALSE,"The MRI scan findings suggest that the patient has suffered an acute PCA infarct (high DWI and low ADC signal in the fronto-parietal lobe) and an old MCA infarct (high DWI and high ADC signal in the medial posterior temporal lobe). The PCA (posterior cerebral artery) is responsible for supplying blood to the occipital and parietal lobes, while the MCA (middle cerebral artery) supplies blood to the temporal lobe. Therefore, the combination of an acute PCA infarct and an old MCA infarct best explains the MRI scan findings.",2,"3. A question about differential diagnoses.

This question would fall under category 2: A question about clinical judgement, what is the correct diagnosis?",E,FALSE,"I chose option 3 (Acute PCA infarct and old MCA infarct) because the MRI findings described in the question are consistent with a combination of an acute infarct and an old infarct in different areas of the brain.

High DWI (Diffusion Weighted Imaging) signal and low ADC (Apparent Diffusion Coefficient) are indicative of an acute infarct, as they represent restricted diffusion due to cytotoxic edema in the affected area. In this case, the acute infarct is located in the fronto-parietal lobe, which is supplied by the posterior cerebral artery (PCA).

On the other hand, high DWI and high ADC signal in the medial posterior temporal lobe suggest an old infarct, as the increased ADC reflects the chronic stage of the infarct where there is less restricted diffusion due to the resolution of cytotoxic edema and the development of gliosis. The medial posterior temporal lobe is supplied by the middle cerebral artery (MCA).

Therefore, the combination of an acute PCA infarct and an old MCA infarct best explains the MRI findings in this patient.",C,TRUE,A
11666,201667,A 17-year-old girl is being investigated for primary amenorrhoea. On examination she has normal secondary sexual characteristics. An HSG shows there to be a blind ended vagina and she goes on to have an MRI scan. This shows complete aplasia of the uterus but the fallopian tubes and ovaries are well demonstrated. What is the most likely diagnosis?,SBA: Paediatrics,Mayer-Rokitansky-Kuster-Hauser (MRKH) syndrome,Diethylstilbestrol exposure in utero,Premature ovarian failure,Turner syndrome,Mullerian duct agenesis,A,80%,3%,0%,2%,15%,"Explanation:
Mullerian duct anomalies (MDA)
The two Mullerian ducts form separately then fuse in the first trimester to form all the structures between the upper vagina and the fallopian tubes. The final part of the amalgamation of the two sides is resorption of the central uterine septum.  There are various classification systems the scope of which is subspecialist. The following is provided for a gross overview only. Different anomalies occur depending on when during development the disruption to normality occurred.
      Aplasia/hypoplasia anomalies
Class I – Agenesis or hypoplasia:
 Agenesis - congenital absence of parts of the mullerian duct; vaginal, cervical, fundal or tubal.
Mayer-Rokitansky-Kuster-Hauser (MRKH) syndrome is an extreme subtype where there is complete aplasia of the upper third of the vagina and uterus. The fallopian tubes and ovaries will be seen normally. Primary amenorrhoea is the usual presentation. 
Class II – Unicornuate: Banana like configuration of the remaining horn
Fusion anomalies
Class III - Didelphys: Non-fusion, two separate uterine horns, two separate cervices. All of the walls contain all of the layers of the normal uterus. The uterine cavities do not communicate with one another owing to the presence of a vaginal septum.
Class IV – Bicornuate: partial fusion, the septum separating the two horns consists of myometrium. There can be either one or two cervices depending on the degree of fusion but crucially the two uterine cavities do communicate with one another. Sometimes the appearance of a bicornuate uterus is referred to as ‘heart-shaped’.
Reabsorption (of uterine septum) anomalies
Class V – Septate: partial fusion, a fibrous remnant septum remains. This is the most common anomaly presenting as infertility.
Class VI – Arcuate: a mild form of septate uterus but which is not associated with subfertility.
The crucial diagnosis to make is that of a septate uterus. Patients with a septate uterus can present with recurrent mid-term miscarriages due to implantation on the suboptimally vascularised septum. Surgical resection of this septum can significantly improve fertility chances. Distinguishing between didelphys and bicollis bicornuate uteri can be very challenging and is beyond the scope of this text.
There is no association with abnormalities of the external genitalia or ovaries since these derive from different embryological components but renal anomalies (agenesis, ectopia, fusion) can be found in around a third of patients and should be actively sought. Infertility is the primary clinical consequence of an MDA.
  Hysterosalpingogram (HSG)
HSGs are performed in the setting of infertility to confirm or refute tubal patency. It is not the ideal modality to diagnose MDAs since it provides information only on the internal contours of any patent cavities. Historically the intercornual angle was used to differentiate between a septate uterus (<75o) and a bicornuate or didelphys uterus (>105o) but this is no longer considered reliable. In addition an HSG will overlook obstructed hemisystems or functional remnants which do not communicate with the vagina.
  Ultrasound
Differentiating between fusion anomalies (bicornuate and didelphys) and reabsorption anomalies (septate and arcuate) depends on the fundal contour. Usually this can be well seen on ultrasound. Where there has been a failure of complete fusion a fundal cleft remains. This should be at least 1cm deep.  If the patient has a septate or arcuate uterus then fusion is complete so the fundus will be domed as is normal. A normal dome is greater than 5mm high.
  MRI
MRI is considered the gold standard for evaluating cases of MDA. The presence of menstrual blood products within an obstructed hemi uterus is, where present, readily seen as high signal on T1. Where a patient has two cervices these can be seen appearing like two ‘owl eyes’ when imaged axially to the vagina.
  Diethylstilbestrol (DES) exposure
DES was an artificial oestrogen used to treat women suffering from recurrent miscarriages. Owing to an association with clear cell carcinoma of the vagina and cervix its use was halted in the 1970s. It also caused shortening of the upper segment of the uterus which gave rise to a very characteristic T-shaped uterine cavity as seen on HSG. This was classed as a Class VII type of MDA.
Pertinent points:
Renal agenesis, ectopia and fusion present in 33% of patients
Aplastic uterus + normal fallopian tubes and ovaries = MRKH syndrome
Widely divergent horns + fundal cleft = fusion anomaly (didelphys or bicornuate)
Two cervices also known as owl eyes on MRI = either didelphys or bicollis bicornuate (difficult to tell them apart)
No communication between two uterine horns = didelphys
Domed fundus = reabsorption anomaly (Septate or arcuate)
Recurrent midterm miscarriages can be due to septate uterus and can be surgically resected to improve fertility.",TRUE,I chose 3. Mayer-Rokitansky-Kuster-Hauser (MRKH) syndrome because it is the most likely diagnosis for a 17-year-old girl with primary amenorrhoea and normal secondary sexual characteristics who has a blind-ended vagina and an MRI scan that shows complete aplasia of the uterus but normal fallopian tubes and ovaries. MRKH Syndrome is a congenital condition that affects the reproductive system and is characterized by the absence of the uterus and the upper part of the vagina. It is usually diagnosed during adolescence and is the most common cause of primary amenorrhoea in young women.,2,,A,TRUE,"I chose Mayer-Rokitansky-Kuster-Hauser (MRKH) syndrome as the most likely diagnosis because the clinical findings and imaging results align with the typical features of this condition. MRKH syndrome is characterized by primary amenorrhoea, normal secondary sexual characteristics, and congenital absence of the uterus and the upper two-thirds of the vagina. The presence of normal fallopian tubes and ovaries, as well as the aplasia of the uterus, further supports this diagnosis. 

The other options are less likely due to the following reasons:

2. Diethylstilbestrol exposure in utero: This can cause various reproductive tract abnormalities, but it typically does not result in complete uterine aplasia.
 
3. Premature ovarian failure: This condition is associated with early menopause and decreased ovarian function, but it does not involve uterine aplasia.

4. Turner syndrome: This genetic disorder affects females and can cause primary amenorrhoea, but it is also associated with other features such as short stature and webbed neck, which were not mentioned in the case.

5. Mullerian duct agenesis: This is actually another term for MRKH syndrome, so it essentially refers to the same condition.",A,FALSE,C
11796,201667,A baby is born by elective caesarean section for known congenital cardiac disease. The aorta and pulmonary trunk both arise from the right ventricle. There is a VSD. The baby has rockerbottom feet and overlapping fingers. What is the nature of the cardiac condition?,SBA: Paediatrics,Double outlet right ventricle,Tetralogy of Fallot,Transposition of the great vessels,Congenitally corrected transposition of the great vessels,Truncus arteriorsus,A,67%,7%,4%,2%,20%,"Explanation:
Double outlet right ventricle
DORV is one of the five Ts of cyanotic and plethoric congenital heart disease (Tingle - i.e. Single - ventricle. The others are Tricuspid atresia, Transposition of the great vessels, TAPVC, truncus arteriosus). As the name suggests, both great vessels (the aorta and pulmonary artery) arise from the right ventricle. Consequently it is logical that 100% of cases have a VSD to facilitate drainage of the left ventricle. If the pulmonary trunk is stenotic, as is usually the case, then the lungs will be oligaemic on a CXR. Conversely in the absence of pulmonary stenosis there will be plethora - this accounts for roughly 25% of cases but yet earns DORV its place in the 5Ts. The crux of the imaging findings, and the phrase to look out for in an exam question setting is that there is no continuity between the mitral valve and the adjacent semilunar valve. This finding is pathognomonic of DORV.
Both Edwards (trisomy 18) and Patau (trisomy 13) syndrome patients can exhibit rockerbottom feet and overlapping fingers although the findings are more closely linked with the former. DORV is associated with both trisomys.
  Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF)
TOF (not to be confused with trache-oesophageal fistula) causes cyanosis but without pulmonary plethora thus is not included in the 5 Ts.
The tetrat consists of:
VSD
Overriding aorta
Right ventricular hypertrophy (RVH)
RV outflow obstruction (hence pulmonary oligaemia)
TOF is the most common cyanotic congenital heart disease presenting after 12 months of age. In ambulant children the classic finding is of squatting whereby the child squats following exertion in order to increase blood flow to the lungs. It usually presents by at least 3-4months of age however, but at birth the condition can be concealed by shunting of blood through a patent ductus arteriosus (PDA). Another facet to the clinical presentation can be polycythaemia which takes place due to chronic low oxygen levels.
Owing to the RVH the cardiac apex is turned upwards contributing to an appearance referred to as ‘boot shaped’ to the cardiac shadow on a CXR.
There is a strong association with right sided aortic arch. Nearly all right sided arches are associated with some form of congenital heart disease and most of these are TOF. Conversely 25% of TOF patients also have a right sided aortic arch.
  Transposition of the Great Vessels (TGA)
TGA is one of the five Ts of cyanotic and plethoric congenital heart disease (The others are Tricuspid atresia, Tingle [ie single] ventricle, TAPVC, truncus arteriosus). Broadly speaking this presents either at birth (it is the most common cyanotic heart disease diagnosed in the first 24 hours of life), or at approximately two weeks of age. Two possible theorised reasons for the later presentation are the closure of the PDA and declining foetal haemoglobin levels leading to decompensation. When the great vessels are transposed there exists two independent circulations. This is therefore only compatible with life if a shunt mechanism also exists, such as an ASD, VSD or PDA. The CXR can be initially normal but develops an ‘egg on side’ appearance to the cardiac shadow. In some cases the transposition is ‘corrected’ where the ventricles are also switched such that the correct ventricle feeds the correct great vessel although the left and right sided circulations remain separate. In corrected transposition the CXR features of note are an apparently absent pulmonary trunk, and an abnormal aortic contour.
  Truncus arteriosus
Embryologically the great vessels begin as one 'conotruncus' which separates during development. When this separation process fails, the baby is left with a single outlet called a truncus arteriosus. On a CXR the baby will be plethoric with cardiomegaly and there are a number of associations which help point towards the answer in an exam question without the aid of an echocardiogram. Forked ribs, DiGeorge syndrome, a right sided arch, or an interrupted arch are all known associations.",FALSE,"Tetralogy of Fallot is the most likely diagnosis in this case, as it is the only cardiac condition that includes all the clinical features mentioned in the question: a VSD, rockerbottom feet, and overlapping fingers. It is also the most common congenital cardiac condition that affects the right ventricle.",2,,B,TRUE,"I chose option 5, Double Outlet Right Ventricle (DORV), because the description of the cardiac condition in the question aligns with the features of DORV. In this congenital heart defect, both the aorta and the pulmonary trunk arise from the right ventricle, instead of the aorta arising from the left ventricle and the pulmonary trunk arising from the right ventricle, as in a normal heart. Additionally, the presence of a Ventricular Septal Defect (VSD) is a common feature in DORV, allowing blood to mix between the two ventricles. The other options do not fully match the given description of the cardiac condition.",A,TRUE,A
14246,201667,You are reviewing the radiographs of a 30-year-old marathon runner who has been experiencing worsening hip pains over the last few months. There is a roundness to the superior aspect of the left femoral neck and you suspect he has cam-type femoroacetabular impingement. Which of the following is most likely to be seen with this abnormality? Select ONE answer only.,SBA: Musculoskeletal and Trauma,Femoral retroversion,Acetabular retrotorsion,Femoral anteversion,Acetabular retroversion,Acetabular anteversion,A,49%,3%,20%,19%,9%,"Explanation:
Femoroacetabular impingement (FAI)
Mixed type - >80% of patients have components of both cam-type and pincer-type FAI.
Cam type - a cam is an engineering term for an oval/egg shaped component with a hole through the middle of the wider end. In cam type FAI the femoral head takes on a 'cam' shaped appearance due to bony overgrowth at the superior aspect of the femoral neck. This abnormal bony contour impinges against the anterosuperior aspect of the acetabulum during movement. The condition occurs more frequently in men and tends to affect men in their 30s. Certain conditions can predispose to cam-type FAI, including SUFE, DDH and Perthes disease. Some patients with cam-type FAI exhibit femoral retroversion.
Pincer type - here bony protuberance of the anterosuperior acetabulum causes over-coverage of the femoral head and impingement against the femoral neck. Protrusio acetabuli predisposes to pincer-type FAI. The relationship of the overgrown anterior acetabular rim to the posterior acetabular rim in pincer-type FAI is called acetabular retroversion since it causes the femoral neck to twist posteriorly. Patients usually stand with their toes pointing outwards as a consequence. The condition is more common in women and a patient is typically aged around 40.",FALSE,"Acetabular anteversion is the most likely abnormality to be seen with cam-type femoroacetabular impingement. This abnormality occurs when the acetabular socket is angled more anteriorly than normal, causing the femoral head to be directed more medially than normal. This can cause the femoral neck to have a rounder superior aspect, which is what is seen in the radiographs of the marathon runner.",2,"3. A question about clinical reasoning, what is the best approach to managing the patient?

This question would fall under option 2: A question about clinical judgement, what is the correct diagnosis?",A,FALSE,"I chose option 3, acetabular retroversion, because it is most commonly associated with cam-type femoroacetabular impingement (FAI). 

Cam-type FAI occurs when there is an abnormal shape of the femoral head-neck junction, which is the roundness you observed in the radiograph. This abnormal shape can cause the femoral head to impinge on the acetabulum (hip socket) during certain hip movements, leading to hip pain and potential damage to the joint.

Acetabular retroversion is a condition where the acetabulum (hip socket) is oriented more posteriorly than normal. This can lead to a reduced range of motion and increased contact between the femoral head and acetabulum, contributing to the development of cam-type FAI. 

The other options (acetabular retrotorsion, femoral anteversion, acetabular anteversion, and femoral retroversion) are not as strongly associated with cam-type FAI as acetabular retroversion is.",D,TRUE,A
9946,201667,A 50- year-old man experiences his first ever seizure and suffers a posterior dislocation of the shoulder. He visits his local A+E department where the joint is imaged. Which of the following is LEAST likely to be found?,SBA: Musculoskeletal and Trauma,Indentation of the posterior humeral head (a Hill-Sachs lesion),Lightbulb sign,Reverse Bankart lesion,Reverse Hill-Sachs lesion,Avulsion of the lesser tuberosity,A,88%,3%,2%,3%,4%,"Explanation:
Anterior dislocation (95%)
The integrity of the shoulder joint is weakest when at extreme abduction and external rotation.
When the humeral head dislocates anteriorly with respect to the glenoid, the posterolateral aspect of the humeral head impacts on the inferior glenoid and both can suffer. The damage to the humeral head is known as a Hill-Sachs lesion and the inferior glenoid fracture is called a Bankart lesion.
  Posterior dislocation (5%)
At extreme abduction with internal rotation the humeral head is forced posteriorly and can dislocate. The usual scenario is in the context of a seizure or alternatively when a patient has been electrocuted. The AP x-ray can seem normal to the untrained eye. If the humerus remains internally rotated, the greater tuberosity rotates to a more anterior position and its characteristic outline is lost leading to the so-called ‘light-bulb’ sign of a posterior dislocation. To establish the relationship between the humeral head and the glenoid, a Y-view, where the glenoid is viewed head-on, is often performed but an axillary view, where the beam travels through the axilla, is said to be even more useful. Avulsion fractures of the lesser tuberosity (where the subscapularis muscle attaches) are commonly seen in association with posterior dislocations.
A bony defect on the anteromedial surface of the humeral head is known as reverse Hill-Sachs lesion. Similarly a tear to the posterior glenoid labrum is called a reverse Bankart lesion.

The patient presents with their arm held over their head. X-rays will show the humeral head displaced downwards and caught underneath the glenoid.",FALSE,I chose 4. Reverse Hill-Sachs lesion because it is the least likely to be found in a 50-year-old man experiencing his first ever seizure and suffering a posterior dislocation of the shoulder.

It is an indentation or compression fracture of the humeral head that occurs when the humeral head impacts against the anterior glenoid rim during an anterior dislocation. Since the patient in the question experienced a posterior dislocation, a Hill-Sachs lesion would be the least likely finding on imaging.",A,TRUE,A
13971,201667,"A 12-year-old boy undergoes a contrast enhanced CT chest for further investigation of a middle mediastinal mass which was found on a chest radiograph. The mass is large with a smooth outline, but with no invasion of adjacent structures. It measures 9 HU and contains no calcification, fat or haemorrhage. What is the most likely diagnosis? Select ONE answer only.",SBA: Paediatrics,Duplication cyst,Normal thymus,Lymphoma,Germ Cell Tumour,Askin Tumour,A,82%,11%,4%,2%,1%,"Explanation:
Duplication cyst
These are very rarely found in the anterior mediastinum, usually being posterior mediastinal (neuroenteric) or middle mediastinal (bronchogenic, enteric).
  Lymphoma
This is the most common anterior mediastinal mass in children. It may be difficult to differentiate a lymphoma from normal thymus, particularly in a patient younger than 10 years of age. Associated lymphadenopathy (i.e. cervical) can be the key to distinguishing the two pathologies. Calcification is rare prior to any treatment but can be a feature of lymphoma which has been treated.
  Germ Cell Tumour
This often causes a large anterior mediastinal mass. It can be subdivided into Teratoma (usually cystic with fat and calcification), seminoma (bulky and lobulated) and Non-seminomatous Germ Cell Tumour (haemorrhage and necrosis).
  Askin Tumour
These heterogenous tumours are part of the Ewing Sarcoma spectrum. Patients are often in their early teens. Askin tumours displace rather than invade adjacent mediastinal structures although rib destruction is common and is a fact which can help distinguish it from a pleuropulmonary blastoma which is another cause of a large mediastinal mass, albeit usually found in babies under the age of 2, but which does not cause rib destruction.",FALSE,"Lymphoma is the most likely diagnosis for a large middle mediastinal mass with a smooth outline, measuring 9 HU and containing no calcification, fat or haemorrhage. Lymphoma is a type of cancer that originates from lymphocytes, which are a type of white blood cell. It is the most common type of cancer in children, with the most common presentation being a large mass in the chest.",2,,B,FALSE,"I chose option 3, Germ Cell Tumour, as the most likely diagnosis based on the given information. The patient is a 12-year-old boy with a large middle mediastinal mass, which is a common location for germ cell tumors. The mass has a smooth outline and no invasion of adjacent structures, which is also consistent with this diagnosis. Additionally, the mass measures 9 HU (Hounsfield units) on the CT scan, which suggests a low-density mass, and this is typical for germ cell tumors, especially those with a cystic component. The absence of calcification, fat, or hemorrhage further supports this diagnosis. 

The other options are less likely based on the provided information:
1. Normal thymus - A large mass in a 12-year-old is less likely to be a normal thymus.
2. Lymphoma - While it can present as a mediastinal mass, lymphomas typically have higher attenuation values (greater than 20 HU) on CT scans.
4. Askin Tumor - These tumors are rare and usually present with an aggressive behavior and invasion of adjacent structures, which is not described in this case.

Umbilical venous lines are used for antibiotic, fluid, TPN and transfusion delivery and obviate the need for multiple cannulation attempts however correct placement is important as the consequences of malplacement can be serious.
Malplaced lines within the heart can cause serious cardiac complications and those within the liver can lead to hepatic complications. Although deliberately not specified well in the question, deviation towards the right (within the appropriate area for the liver on an x-ray) suggests location within the right hepatic or right portal veins.
The UAC courses inferiorly into the pelvis as it traverses the internal iliac artery, before rising through the common iliac artery and thence to the aorta.
The UVC rises up into the abdomen and the tip should run through the ductus venosus to join with the inferior vena cava and be sited within the inferior vena cava at approximately the level of the diaphragm. Misplaced lines usually lie within either the portal vein or hepatic vein.
  Neonatal lines and tubes:

PRECISE (PC Radiological Estimation of Change in Sequential Evaluation)
The PRECISE guidelines have been proposed as a scoring system for evaluating the follow-up scans when patients are on 'active surveillance' management for their prostate cancer (Moore, et al. Eur Urol. 2017;71(4):648-655).
  1 - Resolution of previous features suspicious on MRI
2 - Reduction in volume and/or conspicuity of previous features suspicious on MRI
3 - Stable MRI appearance: no new focal/diffuse lesions
4 - Significant increase in size and/or conspicuity of features suspicious for prostate cancer
5 - Definitive radiologic stage progression
  PI-RADS (Prostate imaging reporting and data system)
This scoring system (now on its second version) has been introduced to streamline prostate cancer reporting and improve inter-operator variability. The scoring system differs slightly between the transitional zone and the peripheral zone but overall, using a combination of the T2, DWI/ADC and dynamic contrast enhancement lesions are graded 1-5 depending on the likelihood of malignancy.
  PERCIST (Positron emission response criteria in solid tumours)
This is a scoring system used for PET/CT imaging to follow up lesions and determine progression. Below is a simplified summary of the different possible outcomes.
Complete metabolic response (CMR) - resolution of target lesions with no new lesions developing
Partial metabolic response (PMR) - 30% reduction in SUV (corrected for lean body mass) in the target lesions
Stable metabolic disease (SMD) - neither CMR, PMR nor PMD
Progressive metabolic disease (PMD) - >30% increase in SUV (corrected for lean body mass) or new lesions
  RECIST (Response evaluation criteria in solid tumours)
To better develop inter-operator agreement in cancer follow-up imaging the RECIST criteria were developed.
Target lesions are identified on the index staging scan and these lesions are evaluated on subsequent scans against size standards to determine whether there has been overall response to treatment or disease progression. Below is a simplified version of the different possible outcomes.
Disease response
Complete - disappearance of all target lesions
Partial - >30% decrease in the sum of the longest axes of all of the target lesions
Stable disease - grey area between partial response and disease progression
Disease progression - >20% increase in the sum of the longest axes of all of the target lesions",FALSE,"I chose PI-RADS2 because it is the Prostate Imaging-Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) version 2 that is used to evaluate prostate cancers on follow-up imaging.

Cardiac CT is susceptible to artefact in multiple forms.
Step artefact is caused by misregistration of anatomical landmarks and is worsened by an irregular heart rhythm or large field of view coupled with a short detector row.
Motion artefact can be caused by breathing, a fast or irregular heart rate. The right coronary artery is usually worst affected by motion artefact. ‘Padding’ around the optimal imaging phase can help to reduce motion artefact.
Streak artefact can be caused by metallic artefacts, severe calcification within the coronary arteries and also a high density of contrast within the SVC or right atrium.",TRUE,"I chose number 5 because irregular heart rhythm is one of the most common causes of motion artefact in cardiac CT.

Which of the following is the next best examination for this patient?",SBA: Central Nervous and Head & Neck,Methionine-PET,FDG-PET,CT,MRI,Sestamibi,A,22%,9%,3%,2%,65%,"Explanation:
The question is asking how is best to locate a suspected ectopic parathyroid adenoma. The traditional answer used to be a Sestamibi scan (Tc99m MIBI). In recent years PET/CT has become more widespread and C-11 Methionine PET/CT is now considered to have a role in parathyroid adenoma localisation. The available evidence currently suggests that PET/CT be used as an adjunct to traditional localisation methods where results from those have proven inconclusive. As such the wording of this particular question is difficult. PET/CT is proven to be more sensitive so if the question asked pertains to sensitivity PET/CT would be the correct answer. Sestamibi is still the first-line investigation in the NHS but how is ‘best’ defined.
In the author’s experience however if PET is given as an option to choose instead of Sestamibi it is probably because the question writers are of a mind that it is better. Of course if PET is not even an option then the correct answer would be sestamibi.",FALSE,"CT is the best examination for this patient because it can provide detailed images of the body, including the parathyroid glands. It can help to diagnose the cause of the elevated calcium and parathyroid hormone levels, and can also help to rule out any other conditions that may be causing the patient's symptoms.",3,"3.

12126,201667,An astute radiologist detects a subdural haematoma in a patient despite the haemorrhage appearing isodense to the brain parenchyma on CT.

This question is to do with the imaging characteristics of blood within the brain. We can think of the intracranial space as a closed box as far as oxygen tensions go which means that blood degrades in a predictable fashion and therefore has predictable appearances on T1 and T2 according to the changes in the haemoglobin molecule. There are a few different methods to help remember the changes in appearance, one of which is the table below:

  The important distinction is around the subacute stages. In that case, by and large, if it is bright on T1 it is subacute and T2 then decides if it is early or late subacute. The timeframes given are also important and can form the basis of 2a exam questions.
  As far as the involvement of CT goes, hyperacute and acute haemorrhage is dense compared to the brain parenchyma but there window of time as the blood breaks down when the haemorrhage becomes isointense to the brain parenchyma and can very easily be missed. This corresponds to the subacute stages. Thereafter the haematoma becomes more serous and therefore darker on CT and once again visible next to the brain parenchyma.",TRUE,"I chose this answer because a subdural haematoma is typically hyperintense on T1-weighted MRI images and hypointense on T2-weighted MRI images. This is due to the presence of methemoglobin in the haemorrhage, which is hyperintense on T1-weighted images and hypointense on T2-weighted images.",1,"3. A question about clinical management, what is the best course of action?

This question falls under category 1: Basic factual recall, either of basic science, physics, anatomy or regarding a procedure.",A,FALSE,"I chose option 3 (T1 = isointense, T2 = hypointense) because it best represents the MRI features of a subdural hematoma that appears isodense to the brain parenchyma on CT. 

An isodense subdural hematoma typically occurs in the subacute stage, which is around 3-7 days after the injury. At this stage, the hematoma has a similar density to the surrounding brain tissue on a CT scan, making it difficult to detect. 

On MRI, the subacute subdural hematoma would appear isointense on T1-weighted images, meaning it has a similar signal intensity to the brain parenchyma. On T2-weighted images, it would appear hypointense, or darker than the surrounding brain tissue. This combination of MRI features (T1 = isointense, T2 = hypointense) helps to differentiate the subdural hematoma from normal brain tissue and other types of hemorrhages, allowing the radiologist to detect the hematoma despite its isodense appearance on CT.",C,TRUE,A
9306,201667,A 28-year-old man undergoing chemotherapy prior to having a bone marrow transplant for his leukaemia presents with abdominal pain and bloody diarrhoea. You are reporting his CT scan which shows oedema and transmural necrosis affecting the caecum. Which of the following is the most likely explanation for these findings?,SBA: Gastrointestinal,Typhlitis,Crohn disease,Tuberculosis,Radiation colitis,Infective colitis,A,88%,1%,1%,6%,3%,"Explanation:
Neutropenic colitis also known as typhlitis
The name typhlitis comes from the greek typhlos meaning blind ending sac and relates to the involvement of the caecum. Although the rest of the bowel can be affected it is the caecum which bears the brunt of this disease. The caecal wall becomes thickened (to >4mm) and markedly oedematous; the appearance may be so extreme that it may seem more like a large fluid density mass than part of the bowel.  Barium studies carry a significant risk of perforation and should be avoided but would show oedema and severe ulceration. On CT transmural oedema with adjacent fat stranding is found. It develops in immunocompromised patients, in particular those undergoing induction chemotherapy prior to bone marrow transplantation.
  Radiation enteritis
Acutely following radiation therapy there is cell death of the rapidly turning over mucosal cells of the bowel wall, and particularly of the terminal ileum. This leads to ulceration and mucosal/submucosal oedema.
Subacutely to chronically the radiation damage leads to endarteritis obliterans and chronic mesenteric ischaemia. The bowel does heal but fibrous changes persist and strictures can form. There is no link in severity between the acute and chronic forms; the presence or absence of the one does not predict the other.
The bowel loops can be seen to be fixed in the same positions on sequential contrast studies by a desmoplastic response within the mesentery. Patients complain of crampy abdominal pain from intermittent obstruction as well as diarrhoea.
  Tuberculosis
Abdominal tuberculosis most commonly affects the ileocaecal junction with thickening of the ileocaecal valve and narrowing of the terminal ileum. This can be seen on fluoroscopic examination as the Fleischner sign or umbrella sign where the gaping ileocaecal valve abuts the thin, strictured terminal ileum. Local lymph node enlargement with or without central low attenuation to the lymph nodes may be seen on CT. Multiple different lesions in multiple sites (i.e. skip lesions) is also a feature and a characteristic feature is of elevation of the margins of an ulcer which follow the orientation of lymphoid follicles. In the colon this means the margins are elevated in the transverse plane but in the terminal ileum they are longitudinal. 
The involvement of the ileocaecal valve and the presence of skip lesions means that a key differential diagnosis is Crohn disease. Over half of cases of abdominal tuberculosis will have concurrent ascites whereas this is a relatively rare feature for Crohn disease and can be used as a discriminator.
Specifically relating to the stomach, tuberculosis can cause pyloric stenosis, multiple deep ulcers on the lesser curve, and linitis plastic type narrowing of the antrum.
  Crohn disease
Crohn disease is characterised by discontinuous (skip lesions) transmural non-caseating granulomatous inflammation. By contrast, ulcerative colitis is characterised by continuous mucosal inflammation. Crohn disease is usually diagnosed in adolescence or young adulthood and patients present with non-specific abdominal pains, diarrhoea, weight loss and anaemia. Crohn disease can affect any part of the entire length of the gastrointestinal tract, in contrast to ulcerative colitis which affects only the colon, but owing to the high concentration of lymphoid tissue in the terminal ileum the vast majority of patients will have terminal ileal involvement, in particular thickening of the iliocaecal valve. Aphthous ulceration is common and on endoscopy a cobblestone appearance to the mucosa can be seen where the thickened and oedematous wall is broken up by deep longitudinal fissures. Deep ‘rosethorn’ ulcers can be seen on fluoroscopic studies.  Strictures and fistulae characterise the chronic sequela of this disease.

14189,201667,You are reporting a CT scan of an adult patient There is a low density mass in the tail of the pancreas measuring around 5cm in diameter. You suspect she has a mucinous cystadenoma. Which of the following is consistent with this diagnosis? Select ONE answer only.,SBA: Gastrointestinal,Patient aged around 45 years,Low CEA level,High amylase level,Location in the head of the pancreas,Innumerable small cysts,A,84%,3%,4%,3%,6%,"Explanation:
Amylase
The presence of any amylase in a pancreatic mass aspirates suggests communication with the pancreatic ductal system. In theory this would help identify an IPMN and a pseudocyst however it has poor sensitivity and specificity for doing so.
CEA levels
Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) is a tumour marker associated with pancreatic adenocarcinomas (as well as colorectal adenocarcinoma and others). Mucinous cystadenomas invariably degenerate to cystadenocarcinomas and as such can often exhibit elevated CEA levels too. It is unusual for a serous cystadenoma to exhibit elevated CEA levels.
Mucinous cystadenoma
Mucinous cystadenomas of the pancreas are subject to a similar adenoma-carcinoma sequence to colonic adenomas. Left long enough, all transform into mucinous cystadenocarcinomas which have a reasonably poor prognosis. Classically patients are middle-aged women (mean age 47years). They are also cystic tumours but whose cysts are larger than for serous cystadenomas i.e. >20mm. They have a predilection for the pancreatic tail.
Serous cystadenoma
These are largely benign tumours which classically occur in elderly ladies in their 70s. They have a sponge like appearance where innumerable small (<20mm) cysts sit around a characteristic central scar. The tumours can be very large, and may even present as a palpable mass, but usually are around 5cm in total diameter. Although they can be found in any part of the pancreas, there is a slight predisposition for the head of the pancreas. There is usually a central scar and calcifications can sometimes be seen within the scar.

1. Low CEA level: While CEA levels can be variable, a mucinous cystadenoma may have elevated CEA levels, so a low level would not be consistent with this diagnosis.
2. High amylase level: Mucinous cystadenomas typically do not have high amylase levels, as they are not associated with pancreatic duct obstruction.
4. Location in the head of the pancreas: Mucinous cystadenomas are more commonly found in the body or tail of the pancreas, not the head.
5. Innumerable small cysts: Mucinous cystadenomas usually present as a single large cyst or a few large cysts, not numerous small cysts.",A,TRUE,A

What is the most likely diagnosis? Select ONE answer only.,SBA: Central Nervous and Head & Neck,Cholesterol granuloma,Glomus tumour,Cholesteatoma,Aberrant internal carotid artery,Haemangioma,A,80%,3%,10%,1%,6%,"Explanation:
Since the lesion is high in T2 signal, high ADC values may be caused by the T2 shine through effect. Certainly, correlation with the DWI appearances would be needed to draw further conclusions and these have not been provided.
A cholesterol granuloma contains both cholesterol crystals and blood products (hence is bright on T1) whereas a cholesteatoma is isointense to brain parenchyma on T1 and can apparently be seen clinically as a whitish mass behind the tympanic membrane. Clinically a cholesterol granuloma may be described as causing a blue tympanic membrane. The absence of pulsatile tinnitus can help distinguish it from a glomus tympanicum.

  An aberrant internal carotid artery can cause a pulsatile mass in the middle ear. The question usually asked on this topic is slightly different and to do with the persistent stapedial artery and consequential aplastic foramen spinosum (anatomically – ‘the heel of the high-heeled shoe’). The stapedial artery in such cases arises from the internal carotid artery and runs through the stapes, becoming the middle meningeal artery (which usually arises from the external carotid artery and courses through the foramen spinosum).",FALSE,"Cholesteatoma is the most likely diagnosis because it is a benign, slow-growing lesion that is composed of keratin and other debris which can return high signal on T1 and T2 weighted sequences, as well as high values on the ADC map.",2,,C,TRUE,"I chose option 5, Cholesterol granuloma, because the MRI findings described in the question are consistent with this diagnosis. The presence of soft tissue in the petrous apex with high signal on both T1 and T2 weighted sequences, as well as high values on the ADC map, suggest a lesion with high lipid content. Cholesterol granulomas are benign lesions that commonly occur in the petrous apex and are characterized by the presence of cholesterol crystals within a granulomatous inflammatory reaction. These lesions typically show high signal intensity on both T1 and T2 weighted images due to the presence of cholesterol and other lipids. The high ADC values indicate that there is no restricted diffusion, which is also consistent with a cholesterol granuloma.",A,TRUE,A

  IPF (Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis) can only be diagnosed in the absence of a precipitating condition such as asbestosis, rheumatoid arthritis, or drug toxicity. Where such exists, the condition is termed UIP (Usual interstitial pneumonia). CFA (Crytpogenic fibrosing alveolitis) is a historic term for the same thing.
There is much overlap in the features of the various different fibrotic lung diseases.
Therefore, look for specific features which are most strongly associated with the different conditions. The table below (despite appearances) simplifies the overall situation significantly and is inadequate for real life radiology but does provide a framework on which to build further understanding of these conditions.
The features in bold are the most prominent in each of the conditions.
  Diagnosis Feature
IPF = UIP = CFA Macrocystic honeycombing, apicobasilar gradient
NSIP Peripheral, associated with CREST/Sjogrens/RA, chemotherapy
COP = BOOP Patchy. Associated with connective tissue diseases, CF, methotrexate, post-transplant
RBILD Smoking, young patients, no bronchiectasis or honeycombing

13827,201667,A 3-day-old baby presents with cyanosis and is diagnosed with truncus arteriosus. Which of the following is LEAST associated with truncus arteriosus?,SBA: Cardiothoracic and vascular,Atrial septal defect,DiGeorge syndrome,Right-sided aortic arch,Ventricular septal defect,Coloboma,A,27%,9%,16%,9%,40%,"Explanation:
Truncus is classically associated with DiGeorge syndrome (Chromosome 22 abnormality characterised by elongated face and cleft palate, also associated with tetralogy of Fallot). Truncus is also associated with the rarer CHARGE syndrome (Coloboma, congenital Heart disease, choanal atresia, retardation, genital hypoplasia, ear abnormalities). It is also strongly associated with a ventricular septal defect, right sided / interrupted arch. Atrial septal defects can occur in association but are far less common than VSDs.",TRUE,"Atrial septal defect is not associated with truncus arteriosus. Truncus arteriosus is a congenital heart defect in which a single vessel, the truncus, arises from the heart and carries both oxygenated and deoxygenated blood to the body. It is often associated with other congenital heart defects, such as ventricular septal defect, right-sided aortic arch, and DiGeorge syndrome. Coloboma is a congenital eye defect that is sometimes associated with truncus arteriosus.",1,This question would fall under category 1: Basic factual recall.,A,FALSE,"I chose option 5, Coloboma, because it is the least associated with truncus arteriosus. Truncus arteriosus is a congenital heart defect where a single blood vessel comes out of the right and left ventricles, instead of the normal two vessels (pulmonary artery and aorta). 

1. DiGeorge syndrome is associated with truncus arteriosus because it is a genetic disorder that affects the development of several body systems, including the heart. Truncus arteriosus is one of the possible heart defects seen in DiGeorge syndrome.
2. Right-sided aortic arch is also associated with truncus arteriosus, as it is a common vascular anomaly that can occur with this congenital heart defect.
3. Atrial septal defect is a defect in the septum between the heart's two upper chambers (atria). It can be associated with truncus arteriosus as a part of the abnormal development of the heart.
4. Ventricular septal defect is a defect in the septum between the heart's two lower chambers (ventricles). It is almost always present in patients with truncus arteriosus, as the single blood vessel arises from both ventricles.

On the other hand, Coloboma (option 5) is a congenital eye abnormality where a part of the eye structure is missing, which is not directly related to truncus arteriosus. It is more commonly associated with CHARGE syndrome, a different genetic disorder.",E,TRUE,A
13813,201667,"A 67-year-old woman undergoes a CT scan of her adrenal glands for an incidental lesion picked up on a CT colonogram. The lesion is situated in the lateral limb of the left adrenal gland and is 2cm in diameter. It measures 38HU on the unenhanced sequence, 115HU on the portal venous phase and 75HU on the delayed sequences. You may use a calculator. What is the relative washout of this lesion?","SBA: Genito urinary, Adrenal, Obstetrics & Gynaecology and Breast",35%,52%,67%,49%,48%,A,69%,15%,8%,3%,5%,"Explanation:
Figures have been rounded to the nearest whole number.
Absolute washout = (115-75)/(115-38) = 52%
Relative washout = (115-75)/115 = 35%
    This lesion is non-adenomatous. Given the avid contrast enhancement on the arterial phase (>110HU) a phaeochromocytoma should be strongly suspected.
  Adrenal washout
Washout characteristics of adrenal nodules help confirm or refute a diagnosis of an adrenal adenoma. The absolute washout takes into account the initial uptake of contrast whereas the relative washout calculation is based only on how well contrast washes out of a nodule.
The underpinning principle is that vasculature within malignant lesions is more permeable than in benign lesions. This allows contrast to diffuse out of the lesion during the portal venous phase and the contrast is then slower to wash out during the delayed phase than it would be for benign lesions. Thus the higher/faster washout characteristics (either absolute or relative) the more suggestive it is that a lesion is benign.
    Phaeochromocytomas also known as adrenal paragangliomas.
Paragangliomas are found all over the body and called different things in different places despite the fact that the histology is the same.
    Phaeochromocytomas are known as the 10% tumours. Purportedly 10% are: bilateral, asymmetrical, familial, are extra-adrenal, contain calcification. The most well known syndromic association is with Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia (MEN) type II (both a and b). They do also occur with phakomatoses (von Hippel Lindau, neurofibromatosis type I, Sturge Weber and Tuberous Sclerosis).
The classic but rare presentation is of uncontrollable hypertension due to catecholamine production and the classic giveaway blood test is elevated levels of urinary VMA.
On CT they can have a range of appearances including post-haemorrhagic or necrotic low attenuation, solid and/or cystic areas. They enhance strongly and are slow to washout. On MRI they tend to return low T1 signal (excepting areas of haemorrhage which may be high) but very bright T2 signal giving rise to the lightbulb sign. The main differential diagnosis would be of adrenal cortical carcinoma. Phaeochromocytomas don't invade the IVC and won't cause atrophy of the contralateral adrenal gland, where adrenal cortical carcinomas can.
  MIBG scanning (I123-Metaiodobenzylguanidine)
This comes under the broader heading of a guanethidine analogue and can be used to pinpoint catecholamine producing tumours such as phaeochromocytomas or other paragangliomas. The scan can be used to locate an extra-adrenal phaeochromocytoma. The tracer is also taken up by neuroblastomas, carcinoid tumours and medullary carcinoma of the thyroid.
If the CT scan shows morphologically normal adrenal glands then an MRI scan is unlikely to be of any further benefit. A dedicated MRI scan of the adrenal glands with in and out of phase sequences might be useful in the setting of an indeterminate mass; if there is signal dropout within the mass it is likely to be an adenoma.
An adrenal biopsy should 'never' be performed for a suspected phaeochromocytoma. The risk is of provoking catecholamine release and triggering extreme hypertension or a cardiac arrhythmia.",FALSE,"The relative washout of this lesion can be calculated by subtracting the HU on the unenhanced sequence from the HU on the delayed sequence, and then dividing by the HU on the portal venous phase. In this case, the calculation would be (75 - 38) / 115 = 0.67, or 67%.",1,"3. A question about problem solving, how to calculate the relative washout?",C,FALSE,"I chose this option because the relative washout percentage calculated using the given Hounsfield Units (HU) from the CT scan is closest to option 1 (52%).

The relative washout is a measure used to differentiate between benign and malignant adrenal lesions. It is calculated using the Hounsfield Units (HU) from the unenhanced, portal venous phase, and delayed sequences of the CT scan.

In this case, I used the provided HU measurements and the formula for relative washout:

Relative washout = ((Enhanced HU - Delayed HU) / (Enhanced HU - Unenhanced HU)) x 100

After plugging in the given values, I calculated the relative washout to be 51.9%. Since this value is closest to option 1 (52%), I chose option 1 as the correct answer.",B,FALSE,D
13737,201667,"You are on duty and called by a cardiothoracic surgeon to discuss a 65-year-old man who presented with intense chest pain.

A bedside echo has shown a thoracic aortic dissection and the surgeon is planning to take the patient to theatre. What should you advise next before the patient is taken to theatre?",SBA: Cardiothoracic and vascular,Nothing,CT thoracic angiogram,CT whole aorta angiogram,MR angiogram,CXR,A,58%,4%,36%,1%,2%,"Explanation:
This patient has a diagnosis already and is haemodynamically unstable. If the patient is suitable for active management he should be taken to theatre without delay.
In a haemodynamically stable patient for whom the diagnosis was in doubt the correct study to perform would be a cardiac-gated CT aortogram:
Unenhanced CT thorax - This phase is important in the diagnosis of an intramural haematoma which can be difficult to pinpoint on subsequent phases.
Arterial phase CT Thorax and Abdomen - It is important to know whether a dissection extends into the abdominal aorta or iliac arteries as well as whether there is any compromise of the mesenteric or renal arteries.
(Portal venous phase CT Thorax and Abdomen - This phase is not always performed but is most useful if previous repairs have been undertaken and a leak is suspected)
  Although not universally available, cardiac-gating of CT scans for acute aortic syndrome is optimal to reduce the rate of false positives which are a well-documented pit-fall to non-gated studies.
Depending on local availability, MR angiography can be a useful adjunct to CT for patients who are allergic to iodinated contrast although clearly the patient must be sufficiently stable to undergo an MRI scan.

10091,201667,A 94-year-old lady who underwent a wide local excision for the management of her breast cancer presents with back pain and undergoes an MRI scan. The T6 vertebra is fractured and collapsed. The rest of the vertebra are of normal height. Which of the following is would make a pathological fracture LESS likely than an osteoporotic one?,SBA: Musculoskeletal and Trauma,Retropulsed fragments,Bowing of the posterior cortex of the vertebral body,Involvement of the posterior elements of the spine,Signal abnormalities at multiple levels,Low T1 and T2 signal in the bone marrow,A,72%,7%,4%,6%,12%,"Explanation:
There are a number of features which can help differentiate between an osteoporotic vertebral collapse and a metastatic one.
  Favours osteoporosis
Favours metastases
Retropulsed bony fragments
Convex posterior cortex
Fluid adjacent to the fractured end plates
Associated soft tissue masses

Abnormal bone (metastases, myeloma, regeneration)
Low but enhances with Gadolinium High (fluid)
Blastic metastases (prostate, breast, TCC) and myelofibrosis
Low Low
  Metastases
Normally metastatic deposits in the spine lead to low T1 signal and high T2 signal. There should be no signal drop out on fat saturated sequences in contrast to marrow reconversion where although red marrow will experience far less signal dropout than yellow marrow, there will still be some loss in signal owing to the fat content of both types of marrow.
Sclerotic or blastic metastases return little signal on either T1 or T2 weighted sequences. These include prostate, breast or TCC metastases among others.
Breast cancer can cause lytic or sclerotic metastases or a mixed picture.
Lytic metastases are more likely than sclerotic metastases to enhance with contrast. Similarly on DWI imaging, whereas lytic metastases will usually appear hyperintense, sclerotic metastases return little signal since they contain little water.
If there is a diffuse abnormality of the bone marrow it can be difficult to identify but normal bone marrow should not be lower in signal intensity than the muscle on T1 weighted sequences.",TRUE,"A retropulsed fragment is a fragment of bone that has been pushed backwards into the spinal canal. This type of fracture is more indicative of a pathological fracture, as it is usually caused by a tumor or infection. Osteoporotic fractures typically do not have retropulsed fragments, as the weakened bone is not strong enough to push fragments into the spinal canal.",1,"3. A question about a clinical scenario, what is the best management?

This question falls under Category 3: A question about a clinical scenario, what is the best management?",A,FALSE,"I chose option 2, ""Bowing of the posterior cortex of the vertebral body,"" because it is a feature more commonly associated with osteoporotic fractures rather than pathological fractures. In osteoporotic fractures, the vertebral body tends to collapse in a wedge shape, causing the posterior cortex to bow. This is due to the loss of bone mass and strength in osteoporosis, making the vertebra more susceptible to compression fractures.

In contrast, pathological fractures are often caused by underlying conditions such as metastatic cancer, which can weaken the bone and make it more prone to fracture. In these cases, the fracture pattern and associated findings may be different, such as retropulsed fragments, involvement of the posterior elements of the spine, or signal abnormalities at multiple levels, which are more suggestive of a pathological fracture.",B,FALSE,B
10731,201667,A 40-year-old athlete complains of calf claudication. On Doppler ultrasound there is popliteal stenosis. He undergoes an MRA which shows a medial slip of the medial head of gastrocnemius. What is the most likely diagnosis?,SBA: Cardiothoracic and vascular,Popliteal artery entrapment syndrome,Cystic adventitial degeneration,Buerger disease,Spinal cord stenosis,Popliteal artery chronic thrombosis,A,96%,2%,1%,0%,1%,"Explanation:
Popliteal artery entrapment syndrome (PAES)
This arises due to an anomalous insertion of the medial head of gastrocnemius which compresses the popliteal artery leading to symptoms of claudication, particularly on exertion, in an otherwise fit individual. Of note, management is surgical; surgical release has far better outcomes than endovascular stenting.
  Cystic adventitial degeneration
On MRI scanning, mucous cysts can be seen in the wall of the popliteal artery. These, like most cysts, show high T2 signal and the T1 signal can be variable depending on the quantity of mucin present. This disease has a strong male preponderance and particularly affects the popliteal artery. On MRI the signal can be variable on T1 depending on the protein content of the cyst but returns a high signal on T2.
  Spinal cord stenosis
The inclusion of this answer pertains to symptoms of neurogenic claudication which can arise in the context of spinal cord stenosis or disc pathology, typically of the lumbar spine. Sensory and/or motor deficit at the appropriate level is found on neurological examination.
  Buerger disease
This disease is strongly linked to smoking and manifests as a vasculitis of the smaller arteries. Arterial occlusion with the formation of corkscrew-shaped collaterals occurs initially in the small arteries of the hands and feet but becoming more proximal as the disease progresses. Of note the larger proximal and central arteries lack the calcification which would otherwise be seen with disease of this extent when caused by atherosclerosis. ",TRUE,"This is the most likely diagnosis because the patient's symptoms are consistent with popliteal artery entrapment syndrome, and the Doppler ultrasound and MRA both show evidence of a stenotic lesion in the popliteal artery. Additionally, the MRA shows a medial slip of the medial head of gastrocnemius, which is a common finding in popliteal artery entrapment syndrome.",2,,A,TRUE,"I chose option 5, Popliteal artery entrapment syndrome, because the given clinical scenario and imaging findings are consistent with this diagnosis. 

A 40-year-old athlete presenting with calf claudication indicates a possible vascular issue in the lower extremity. The Doppler ultrasound finding of popliteal stenosis further supports a vascular problem in the popliteal artery. The MRA finding of a medial slip of the medial head of gastrocnemius is a classic anatomical variation associated with Popliteal artery entrapment syndrome.

Popliteal artery entrapment syndrome occurs when there is an abnormal relationship between the popliteal artery and the surrounding musculotendinous structures, leading to compression of the artery, reduced blood flow, and symptoms such as claudication. In this case, the medial slip of the medial head of gastrocnemius is causing the entrapment and stenosis of the popliteal artery.",A,TRUE,A
14505,201667,"A 75-year-old woman taking warfarin for AF falls and sustains a head injury. She undergoes a CT scan which shows an intraparenchymal haemorrhage. She is managed conservatively and later undergoes an MRI scan for follow up. Regarding the signal intensity of the blood, which of the following is INCORRECTLY matched to the likely findings? Select ONE answer only.",SBA: Central Nervous and Head & Neck,Bright on T1 and isointense on T2 = Late subacute,Isointense on T1 and bright on T2 = Hyperacute,Iso on T1 and dark on T2 = Acute,Dark on T1 and bright on T2 = Chronic,Bright on T1 and dark on T2 = Early subacute,A,36%,6%,8%,45%,5%,"Explanation:
Please note that the question asks which finding is INCORRECTLY matched to the signal characteristics.
Chronic bleeds are dark on T1 and dark-rimmed on T2 (bright centre).
This question is to do with the imaging characteristics of blood within the brain. We can think of the intracranial space as a closed box as far as oxygen tensions go which means that blood degrades in a predictable fashion and therefore has predictable appearances on T1 and T2 according to the changes in the haemoglobin molecule. There are a few different methods to help remember the changes in appearance, one of which is the table below:
  Time-frame Haemoglobin T1 T2 Mnemonic
Hyperacute (hours)   Iso Bright - IBBY
Acute (0-2 days) Intracellular deoxyHb Dark / Iso Dark - IDDY
Early subacute (3-7 days) Intracellular metHb Bright Dark - BIDDY
Late subacute (8-30 days) Extracellular metHb Bright Bright - BABY
Chronic (> 30 days) Intracellular haemosiderin Dark Dark rim - DODO
  In real life and for the 2b exam the important distinction is around the subacute stages.
In that case, by and large, if it is bright on T1 it is subacute and T2 then decides if it is early or late subacute. The timeframes given are also important and can form the basis of 2a exam questions.
  Of the other answers provided therefore:
Bright on T1 and dark on T2 = Early subacute
Dark on T1 and bright on T2 = Chronic (the centre is T2 bright. It is the rim which is T2 dark).
Dark on T1 and dark on T2 = Acute
Isointense on T1 and bright on T2 = Hyperacute
Bright on T1 and bright on T2 = Late subacute",FALSE,"The correct answer is 5. Bright on T1 and dark on T2 does not match any of the stages of bleeding. Isointense on T1 and bright on T2 is typically seen in hyperacute hemorrhages, bright on T1 and isointense on T2 is seen in late subacute hemorrhages, isointense on T1 and dark on T2 is seen in acute hemorrhages, and dark on T1 and bright on T2 is seen in chronic hemorrhages.",1,"3.

3. A question about clinical management, what is the best course of action?",D,FALSE,"I chose option 3 because it is incorrectly matched to the likely findings of the signal intensity of the blood in an MRI scan. In the chronic stage of an intraparenchymal hemorrhage, the blood products are usually dark on both T1 and T2 weighted images, not dark on T1 and bright on T2 as stated in option 3. This is due to the presence of hemosiderin, a breakdown product of hemoglobin, which has a strong T2 shortening effect and appears dark on both sequences.",D,TRUE,A
9491,201667,A 74-year-old man who sustained a severe hospital acquired pneumonia during his recovery from a fractured femoral neck now develops watery diarrhoea and abdominal pain. He undergoes a CT scan on which can be seen marked circumferential bowel wall thickening affecting the entire colon. There is only minimal pericolonic stranding. There is ascites and the small bowel looks normal. Which of the following features would be be more indicative of a diagnosis of pseudomembranous colitis as opposed to inflammatory bowel disease?,SBA: Gastrointestinal,Ascites,Lack of small bowel involvement,Mild pericolonic fat stranding,Involvement of the entire colon,Marked circumferential bowel wall thickening,A,53%,9%,16%,13%,9%,"Explanation:
Ascites is seen in patients with pseudomembranous colitis. The exact prevalence is not robustly demonstrable in literature at present but certainly the presence of ascites can be a useful discriminatory since inflammatory bowel diseases tend NOT to show ascites.
Pseudomembranous colitis
Antibiotic therapy, particularly with broad spectrum penicillins, can deplete the normal colonic flora and permit overgrowth of clostridium difficile. Some patients may be asymptomatic from this overgrowth but others can develop pseudomembranous colitis. There will be a profuse watery diarrhoea with abdominal pains and fever. The condition is defined by the development of a pseudomembrane of exuded fibrin and cellular debris within the colon seen on endoscopy. Both endoscopic and fluoroscopic examinations are contraindicated in severe cases owing to the risk of perforation. On CT around a third of patients have no findings at all but more usually there is diffuse colonic wall thickening affecting the entire colon and to an extent which is not seen in any other disease process (except Crohn disease).The accordion sign occurs when oral contrast medium sits between the closely spaced oedematous folds of the colon. Pericolonic fat stranding is disproportionately mild but ascites is a common co-existent finding. Complicating features which should be ruled out on a CT scan include toxic megacolon, pneumatosis coli and portal venous gas.",FALSE,"The presence of marked circumferential bowel wall thickening is more indicative of a diagnosis of pseudomembranous colitis as opposed to inflammatory bowel disease. Pseudomembranous colitis is caused by the overgrowth of the bacteria Clostridium difficile, which results in inflammation and thickening of the bowel wall. This is typically more pronounced in the colon, and is often accompanied by ascites and minimal pericolonic fat stranding. In contrast, inflammatory bowel disease typically involves the small bowel as well as the colon, and is usually associated with more extensive pericolonic fat stranding.",2,"2. A question about clinical judgement, what is the correct diagnosis?",D,FALSE,"I chose option 1, ""Lack of small bowel involvement,"" because pseudomembranous colitis is typically characterized by inflammation and damage to the colon, while inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) can involve both the small and large intestines. The fact that the small bowel looks normal in this case makes it more likely to be pseudomembranous colitis rather than IBD.",B,TRUE,A
12591,201667,A 31-year-old lady who delivered by vaginal delivery 2 years ago following a pregnancy complicated by pre-eclampsia complains of secondary amenorrhoea. Her GP thinks she might be suffering from pre-eclampsia due to an occult pregnancy but a serum pregnancy test is negative. She is taken for a scan. What are the expected imaging features?,SBA: Central Nervous and Head & Neck,Atrophic pituitary,Haemorrhage into enlarged pituitary lobe and ischaemic changes in both occipital lobes on CT,Low attenuation and loss of grey/white matter differentiation in both occipital lobes,A moderate volume of sub-arachnoid blood,Homogeneous enlargement of the pituitary showing high T1 and low T2 on MRI,A,64%,15%,5%,1%,15%,"Explanation:
Sheehan syndrome is consequent on obstetric hypovolaemia. Pre-eclampsia certainly increases the risk of peri-partum haemorrhage and with little further information provided, Sheehan syndrome is a viable option. Chronically, the pituitary of a patient with Sheehan syndrome becomes atrophic to the point of radiological invisibility (empty sella).
    Pituitary apoplexy
Pathologically, pituitary apoplexy is infarction which can take place with or without haemorrhage. Over half of patients have an underlying macroadenoma; haemorrhage into a pre-existing macroadenoma is the usual presentation. 'All' patients present with a headache and panhypopituitarism. Visual impairment is also common as the pituitary enlarges and impacts on the chiasm. On a CT scan there will be a sellar/suprasellar mass (ie pituitary enlargement). Hyperdensity is caused by the underlying haemorrhage, if present. On an MRI, the pituitary can be seen to be enlarged with T1 hyperintensity (specifically in the subacute phases). In the chronic phase however, the pituitary will be involuted and small, even appearing as an 'empty sella'.
  Sheehan syndrome is pituitary apoplexy due to hypovolaemic shock and can be consequential to delivery. At the time of apoplexy, the predominant issue for the patient is the systemic hypovolaemia for which aggressive management is usually already being pursued. In the early days following the delivery, the first hypopituitary issues to manifest is usually any or all of hyponatraemia, diabetes insipidus or hypothyroidism. At this time the MRI findings can vary from a normal appearing pituitary through to the classic pituitary apoplexy appearances of an enlarged pituitary with high T1 signal. Patients can also present many months or years later with panhypoituitarism at which time an MRI will usually show an empty sella.
  Sheehan syndrome is pituitary apoplexy due to hypovolaemic shock and can be consequential to delivery. The visual field problems can be caused by pressure effects on the optic chiasm. The answer given describes the classical appearance for Sheehan syndrome in the acute setting. The answer ‘haemorrhage into enlarged pituitary lobe’ would be an arguable second best answer however the occipital lobe changes are not related to Sheehan syndrome but again this would be in the acute setting. Of the answers offered, pituitary atrophy is the most likely finding in the chronic setting.",TRUE,"Answer: 5. Atrophic pituitary. Pre-eclampsia is a condition that can cause secondary amenorrhoea due to the high blood pressure and other physiological changes associated with the condition. It can also cause ischaemia to the pituitary gland, leading to atrophic changes in the gland. This can be seen on MRI as homogeneous enlargement of the pituitary gland with high T1 and low T2 signal intensity.",3,"3. A question about clinical problem-solving, what tests or treatments should be used?

This question falls under category 3: A question about clinical problem-solving, what tests or treatments should be used?",D,FALSE,"I chose option 2 because the clinical scenario suggests the possibility of Sheehan's syndrome, which is a condition that occurs due to ischemic necrosis of the pituitary gland following severe postpartum hemorrhage. The pituitary gland is particularly vulnerable to ischemia in the postpartum period due to its enlargement during pregnancy. 

In Sheehan's syndrome, imaging features may include hemorrhage into the enlarged pituitary gland and ischemic changes. On a CT scan, these ischemic changes can be observed in both occipital lobes. The other options do not accurately describe the expected imaging features of Sheehan's syndrome:

1. Atrophic pituitary: This may be seen in the chronic phase of Sheehan's syndrome, but the question is focused on the acute presentation.
3. Low attenuation and loss of grey/white matter differentiation in both occipital lobes: This is a nonspecific finding and not directly related to Sheehan's syndrome.
4. A moderate volume of sub-arachnoid blood: This finding suggests a subarachnoid hemorrhage, which is not related to Sheehan's syndrome.
5. Homogeneous enlargement of the pituitary showing high T1 and low T2 on MRI: This finding is not specific for Sheehan's syndrome and could be seen in other pituitary pathologies.

Therefore, option 2 is the most appropriate choice for the expected imaging features in this clinical scenario.",B,FALSE,D
11131,201667,A 29-year-old man with back pain has an MRI which shows an eccentrically lesion expanding spinal cord centred at T4. It is hyperintense on T2 with some enhancement post contrast. The interpedicular distance at this level is widened. What is the most likely diagnosis?,SBA: Musculoskeletal and Trauma,Astrocytoma,Haemangioblastoma,Epidermoid,PNET,Ganglioglioma,A,62%,12%,15%,3%,8%,"Explanation:
This question pertains to spinal lesions. The characteristics of the lesions listed should all be relatively familiar to the candidate but their features are a little different when considered as spinal lesions. The main other differential diagnosis not given is a spinal ependymoma. By and large for an intramedullary lesion in the cord of a young adult the differential diagnosis is between an Ependymoma and an Astrocytoma. There are a few features which separate them. Ependymomas are far and away the most common intramedullary spinal cord tumour though.
  Astrocytoma
Spinal astrocytomas are the second most common intramedullary spinal tumour in adults.There is overlap of many of the features of astrocytomas and ependymomas. Eccentricity within the axial slice of the cord is a strong pointer to it being an astrocytoma as opposed to an Ependymoma (although the latter hasn’t been given as an alternative).Ependymomas tend to show avid contrast enhancement whereas what has been described here is less severe than that.
  Haemangioblastoma
The classic description for haemangioblastomas is of a cyst with an enhancing nodule. This occurs far less commonly in spinal haemangioblastomas than it does for posterior fossa ones. Cystic components are still extremely common for spinal haemangioblastomas however. On MRI spinal haemangioblastomas are iso or high on T1 and high on T2. Sometimes they can cause polycythaemia due to erythropoietin production.
  Epidermoid
These tumours are usually extramedullary and there is a strong association with vertebral anomalies. The imaging feature usually tested is that they restrict diffusion.
  PNET(primitive neuroectoderm tumour)
The age range for intracranial PNET is quoted as < 5 years. Spinal PNETs have been reported in the literature as case reports but are very rare.
  Ganglioglioma
Spinal gangliomas are a reasonable differential diagnosis for intramedullary cord lesions however are more prevalent in the paediatric cohort and still far less common than ependymomas. They tend to show heterogeneity on T1.",FALSE,"Ganglioglioma is the most likely diagnosis because it is a tumor that typically affects the spine, is hyperintense on T2-weighted MRI scans, and is associated with widening of the interpedicular distance. It is also known to cause back pain, which is a symptom the patient is experiencing.",2,,E,FALSE,"I chose option 2, Haemangioblastoma, as the most likely diagnosis based on the given MRI findings. The description of an eccentrically expanding spinal cord lesion that is hyperintense on T2 and shows some enhancement post contrast is more characteristic of a haemangioblastoma. Additionally, the widened interpedicular distance at the T4 level further supports this diagnosis, as it indicates the presence of a space-occupying lesion.

Haemangioblastomas are vascular tumors that can occur in the spinal cord, and they typically present with these imaging features. While some of the other options, such as astrocytoma or ganglioglioma, may also present as spinal cord lesions, their imaging characteristics and locations differ from those described in the question.",B,TRUE,A
13706,201667,You are performing a trans-vaginal ultrasound lady on a 27-year-old lady. She presented to A+E with severe acute pelvic pain and vomiting. She denies per vaginum bleeding and a beta-hcg test was performed which was elevated. The gynaecology registrar suspects she may have an ectopic pregnancy. Which of the following is most specific for an ectopic pregnancy?,"SBA: Genito urinary, Adrenal, Obstetrics & Gynaecology and Breast",A decidual cast,A yolk sac,A double decidual layer,Endometrial thickening,A corpus luteum cyst,A,35%,22%,30%,10%,3%,"Explanation:
A decidual cast refers to the appeance of echogenic debris within the uterine cavity in the context of an ectopic pregnancy. All the other signs also occur in an intra-uterine pregnancy.
  Ectopic pregnancy 
Vaginal bleeding is very common in early pregnancy but vaginal bleeding with pain or pain without vaginal bleeding definitely call for an ectopic pregnancy to be excluded. Factors which increase the risk of ectopic pregnancy include:
Previous ectopic 
IVF conception
Previous surgery to the Fallopian tubes
PID

Since most present around 7-8 weeks gestation it is usual that the woman will not yet have had the first routine ultrasound scan, or in many cases, may not yet be aware of the pregnancy at all. Serial serum beta HCGs usually fail to double in the usual 48hours for ectopic pregnancies. The exact level of beta HCG helps guide the sonographer as to what they can expect to find. An ectopic pregnancy is most commonly located within one or other Fallopian tube. Ultrasound will fail to show an intrauterine pregnancy and the ectopic pregnancy can often be seen as a cystic mass elsewhere. The classic ‘ring of fire’ sign refers to the peripheral colour Doppler flow seen on an ectopic pregnancy although this can also be seen on a normal corpus luteal cyst. 
Finding Chance of ectopic
Tubal ring sign - echogenic ring around the ectopic 95%
Complex adnexal cystic mass 95%
Free fluid + empty uterus (+B-hcg) 70%
Pseudogestational sac 20%
Simple adnexal cyst 10%
  Ultrasound findings in early pregnancy
A double decidual layer may be identifiable in an early pregnancy at an earlier stage than a yolk sac. Its presence can disprove the diagnosis of an ectopic pregnancy but its absence should not be used to confirm the diagnosis of an ectopic pregnancy. It is seen as two concentric rings around a sac of fluid.
A pseudogestational sac refers to the presence of fluid within the endometrial cavity which could be mistaken for a true gestational sac. The pseudo-finding is usually central to the endometrial cavity whereas a true sac is often eccentrically placed.  Importantly, there will be no yolk sac in a pseudogestational sac; a feature which defines a gestational sac.
  The corpus luteum
The corpus luteum consists of the remnant of a ruptured ovarian follicle following ovulation. It produces oestrogen and progesterone to sustain a pregnancy following fertilisation. On ultrasound it is seen as a thick walled cyst with peripheral vascularity on colour Doppler flow. This 'ring of fire' appearance can be confused with an ectopic pregnancy.",FALSE,"A yolk sac is the most specific indicator of an ectopic pregnancy because it is an early sign of a developing fetus, and it is only present in a normal intrauterine pregnancy. The other options listed can be present in both ectopic and normal pregnancies, making them less specific for an ectopic pregnancy.",2,"3. A question about clinical management, how to best manage a patient?

This question falls under category 2: A question about clinical judgement, what is the correct diagnosis?",C,FALSE,"I apologize for my previous response, as it was incorrect. The correct answer should be:

Choose the correct number: 1. A yolk sac

Explanation: A yolk sac is the most specific for an ectopic pregnancy because it is an early sign of a developing embryo outside of the uterus. In a normal pregnancy, the yolk sac would be found within the uterus, but in an ectopic pregnancy, it is located outside the uterine cavity, usually in the fallopian tube. The presence of a yolk sac in an abnormal location is a strong indication of an ectopic pregnancy.",D,FALSE,C
14461,201667,The renal arteries divide at the hila of the kidneys to form which arteries? Select ONE answer only.,"SBA: Genito urinary, Adrenal, Obstetrics & Gynaecology and Breast",Segmental branches,Interlobar arteries,Arcuate arteries,Interlobular arteries,The vasa recta,A,62%,28%,4%,5%,1%,"Explanation:
The arterial supply to the kidneys is from the renal arteries, two fast flowing arteries that arise from the abdominal aorta at the L2 vertebral level. As the abdominal aorta is situated slightly to the left of the midline the right renal artery is longer than the left. The kidneys receive approximately 20% of the cardiac output.
After arising from the aorta, the right renal artery passes behind the inferior vena cava, the right renal vein, the head of the pancreas, and the second part of the duodenum as it travels to the kidney. The left renal artery passes behind the left renal vein, the body of the pancreas and the splenic vein as it travels to the kidney. The left renal artery is crossed anteriorly by the inferior mesenteric vein.
The renal arteries then enter the kidney at thehila of the kidneys, which lie approximately in the transpyloric plane at the L1 vertebral level. At the hila the renal arteries divide into four or five segmental branches.
Each segmental branch divides to form the interlobar arteries that are situated on either side of every renal pyramid. These interlobar arteries then undergo further division to form the arcuate arteries.
The interlobular arteries are then given off at right angles from the side of the arcuate arteries, and head into the cortical substance. Once within the cortex a final division takes place with the interlobular arteries dividing to form the efferent arterioles.
In the outer two-thirds of the cortex, the efferent arterioles form the peritubular network. The inner third of the cortex is supplied by long, straight arteries known as the vasa recta.

Courtesy of Piotr Michal Jaworski CC BY-SA 3.0",FALSE,I chose this answer because interlobular arteries are the arteries that branch off of the renal arteries at the hila of the kidneys.

10376,201667,A 7mm peripherally located fat density partly calcified lung lesion suspected to be a pulmonary hamartoma is being reviewed in the MDT. The patient is a known smoker.  What follow up should you recommend?,SBA: Cardiothoracic and vascular,None,CT 3/12,CT 6/12,Biopsy,CXR in 3/12,A,85%,7%,5%,1%,1%,"Explanation:
With the presence of fat density the diagnosis of hamartoma can be made and consequently no follow up is required.
Fat within a thoracic mass is diagnostic of a hamartoma but is only seen in approximately half of cases. In contradistinction to carcinoid tumours, hamartomas tend to be peripherally located whereas carcinoid tumours are often more central. Exceptions to both are reasonably frequent however. Calcification, especially popcorn calcification, is also very classical for hamartomas if present. Cavitation is not a feature often associated with them, but it can be found occasionally. Chondromas (very similar to hamartomas radiologically, but distinct entities histologically) form part of the Carney triad (pulmonary chondromas, gastric leiomyosarcomas and extra-adrenal paragangliomas). NB this is different from Carney complex (atrial myxoma, facial/buccal pigmentation, sertoli tumours of the testis and multiple other findings).

 ",TRUE,"I chose number 2 because pulmonary hamartomas are benign lesions that are considered to be asymptomatic and do not require follow up. They are also unlikely to grow or change in size over time. Therefore, no follow up is recommended.",1,"This question falls under 1. Basic factual recall, either of basic science, physics, anatomy or regarding a procedure.",C,FALSE,"I chose option 1, which is a CT scan in 3 months, because the patient is a known smoker, and this increases the risk of lung cancer. Although the lesion is suspected to be a pulmonary hamartoma, which is a benign lung tumor, it is crucial to follow up on this case to ensure that there is no malignant transformation or any other suspicious changes in the lesion. A CT scan provides a more detailed image than a chest X-ray (CXR) and allows for a better assessment of the lesion. A follow-up in 3 months is an appropriate timeframe to detect any significant changes in the lesion while minimizing the patient's exposure to radiation.",B,TRUE,A
10626,201667,A 76-year-old man presents with fresh blood PR.

Which vessel should be targeted first in the search for the source of the bleeding?,SBA: Cardiothoracic and vascular,IMA,SMA,Coeliac axis,Gastroduodenal artery,Marginal artery of Drummond,A,75%,12%,2%,4%,7%,"Explanation:
Fresh PR bleeding is most likely to be colonic. When performing a mesenteric angiogram it is wise to begin with the IMA since once contrast begins to be excreted renally, the filling of the bladder may obscure more inferiorly placed bowel loops.
The gastroduodenal artery arises from the common hepatic artery, a main branch of the celiac axis. The Marginal artery of Drummond completes an anastomotic loop connecting the SMA, via the middle colic artery, and the IMA.",FALSE,"The coeliac axis is the first vessel to be targeted in the search for the source of the bleeding because it is the most proximal vessel in the arterial system. It is the main artery supplying the upper gastrointestinal tract and is the most likely source of bleeding in this case. Additionally, it is easier to access and visualize the coeliac axis compared to the other vessels listed.",1,"3.

3. A question about the application of knowledge, how to apply knowledge to a clinical situation.",D,FALSE,"I chose the Superior Mesenteric Artery (SMA) as the first vessel to be targeted in the search for the source of bleeding because the patient presents with fresh blood per rectum (PR). This suggests that the bleeding is likely to be of lower gastrointestinal (GI) origin. The SMA supplies blood to the midgut, which includes the distal part of the duodenum, jejunum, ileum, ascending colon, and the proximal two-thirds of the transverse colon. These areas are part of the lower GI tract, making the SMA a logical starting point for the investigation.",B,FALSE,B
9261,201667,"You are reviewing the images of a 41-year-old female patient who has previously undergone a wide local excision for T1N0 DCIS to the left breast. She subsequently had an ultrasound scan which made an incidental note of a 5cm liver lesion. She goes on to have an MRI scan and the lesion is reported as returning high signal on T2 weighted images and T1 weighted arterial phases, becoming isointense on portal venous phases and showing delayed enhancement of a central scar. What is the most likely diagnosis?",SBA: Gastrointestinal,Focal nodular hyperplasia,Simple cyst,Fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma,Breast metastasis,Focal steatosis,A,90%,0%,8%,1%,0%,"Explanation:
Focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH)
These lesions typically occur in women in late middle age. They are not caused by oral contraceptive use however they do enlarge in response to hormone stimulation. They are composed of hyperplastic hepatocytes and are thought to arise when a small underlying congenital vascular malformation means that an area of the liver receives a better blood supply and therefore grows better, thus they lack a true capsule but can outgrow their blood supply resulting in the classical central fibrous scar which is present in around half of cases. On imaging they do demonstrate mass effect, displacing adjacent vessels, have marked arterial enhancement which fits in with their supposed aetiology. The central scar enhances only on delayed sequences. On MRI they tend to return high signal on T2 weighted sequences. Their appearance on contrast enhanced ultrasound is interesting; the central scar enhances very early in the arterial phase, branching out in a spoke-wheel type of appearance. During the main arterial phase the lesions enhance strongly before becoming isoechoic in the portal venous phase.
  Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)
Although metastases are the most common cause of malignant hepatic lesions, hepatocellular carcinoma is the most common primary hepatic malignancy. It usually arises on a background of cirrhosis of any cause. Patients with any of the hepatitis viruses, alcoholic cirrhosis, haemochromatosis, and Wilson disease are all at risk. Carcinogens such as thorotrast and aflatoxin also predispose to HCC formation. Serum alpha fetoprotein levels are often raised, in contrast with cholangiocarcinomas which are one of the main differential diagnoses.
Thorotrast is a carcinogenic historic contrast agent used in the 30s and 40s. Its use was abruptly curtailed once it was realised that it is retained indefinitely in the reticuloendothelial system. It causes hepatocellular carcinomas and cholangiocarcinomas but hepatic angiosarcomas are the most frequently quoted related malignancies.
On imaging HCCs can have a variety of appearances. A large irregular mass with satellite nodules is the most common finding but a diffuse infiltrative version can also occur. Since HCCs derive their blood supply from the hepatic artery they show arterial enhancement on CT with washout on later phases. On ultrasound HCCs tend to be hypoechoic when compared to the rest of the liver and on MRI they show variable signal intensity on both T1 and T2 but arterial enhancement with venous washout can again be seen once Gadolinium has been given.
Fibrolamellar carcinoma of the liver is a specific subtype which occurs in slightly younger patients with otherwise normal livers. It is an echogenic lobulated mass on ultrasound with a central fibrous scar which does not enhance on CT. The lack of enhancement with, and sometimes presence of calcification, in the scar separates it from fibrous nodular hyperplasia which is the main differential diagnosis. On MRI the scar returns low signal on T1 and T2 owing to its fibrous nature.
  Breast metastasis
The breast cancer detailed in this question is a red herring. Although secondary hepatic lesions are more common than primary ones, the very low staging of this lady’s breast cancer as well as the imaging characteristics given makes HCC the most likely diagnosis.
  Focal steatosis also known as focal fatty infiltration
The liver plays a small role in fat storage and subtle variation in blood supply and drainage between different areas can lead to variations in the amount of fat in those areas. Focal fatty change is very common and has a geographic appearance on all imaging modalities, with a lack of mass effect (ie preservation of the vascular architecture). It can occur anywhere within the liver but is classically found adjacent to the falciform ligament (i.e. segments II, III and IV). Fat-identifying sequences on MRI can be very useful to clinch the diagnosis with signal dropout on out-of-phase images.
  Simple cyst
Hepatic cysts are very common and usually of no consequence. Multiple cysts do occur in the normal population as well as in patients with von Hippel Lindau syndrome or adult polycystic kidney disease. On ultrasound they are well defined, anechoic with posterior acoustic enhancement and no internal vascularity. On MRI they follow water on all sequences. On CT they have Hounsfield Units of 0-10 and do not enhance.",FALSE,"The MRI findings described in the patient are consistent with a diagnosis of fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma. This type of liver cancer typically presents as a large, solitary, well-defined lesion with high signal on T2-weighted images and T1-weighted arterial phases, becoming isointense on portal venous phases and showing delayed enhancement of a central scar. This is in contrast to other liver lesions such as simple cysts, focal nodular hyperplasia, and focal steatosis, which typically show different imaging characteristics.",2,,C,TRUE,"I chose option 4, Focal Nodular Hyperplasia (FNH), as the most likely diagnosis because the MRI findings described are characteristic of FNH. FNH is a benign liver lesion and the MRI features mentioned, such as high signal on T2 weighted images, T1 weighted arterial phase enhancement, isointensity on portal venous phase, and delayed enhancement of a central scar, are consistent with this diagnosis.

The abdominal lymph nodes can be broadly divided into pre-aortic and para-aortic groups, depending upon their relationship to the aorta.
The pre-aortic nodes lie anterior to the aorta and lie around the origins of the visceral (anterior) arteries. They drain the gastrointestinal tract and its accessory viscera (liver, spleen and pancreas). These nodes can be further divided into three groups, each lying near to the origins of their respective artery:
Coeliac lymph nodes
Superior mesenteric lymph nodes
Inferior mesenteric lymph nodes
  All of the efferent lymphatics from the pre-aortic nodes drain into the intestinal trunk, which in turn drains into the cisterna chlyi.

There is a defined differential for ‘lesions which cross the corpus callosum’ for which there is a defined differential: GBM, lymphoma, infarction, trauma, radiation, metastases, MS. Although not well described here the ‘T2 changes’ could be oedema relating to the mass.
PML (progressive multifocal leucoencephalopathy) is an HIV related condition caused by the JC virus which is classically described as having asymmetrical high T2 signal but there isn’t anything else in the question which points to this.
Gliomatosis cerebri is a horrible tumour seen as generalised high T2 signal involving at least three lobes but is usually found in younger patients than this.
An anaplastic astrocytoma is a main player in the differential diagnosis for ‘lesions which cross the corpus callosum’ but is more prevalent in younger or middle aged patients.
Thus the answer for this question comes down to lymphoma or GBM. Both can be low on T1 and high on T2 but homogeneous contrast enhancement makes the answer more likely to be lymphoma.",FALSE,"Glioblastoma multiforme is the most likely diagnosis because it is the most aggressive type of brain tumor and typically presents with a mass involving the corpus callosum, low T1 signal, high T2 signal, avid homogeneous contrast enhancement, and T2 changes in periventricular regions.",2,,B,TRUE,"I chose option 4, Lymphoma, because the description of the mass and its imaging characteristics are consistent with a primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL).

In which space is the lesion most likely to be?,SBA: Central Nervous and Head & Neck,Carotid,Parotid,Masticator,Retropharayngeal,Pharyngeal mucosal,A,71%,3%,2%,20%,3%,"Explanation:
Head and neck anatomy is all about the parapharyngeal space and its relationships. The parapharyngeal space is a small and unobtrusive space itself containing only fat, some branches of the trigeminal nerve and a few vessels but is sat right in the middle of the soft tissues of the neck on each side and as a result gets pushed about when the surrounding spaces are invaded. It is therefore the head and neck radiologist’s best friend.

Select ONE answer only.",SBA: Gastrointestinal,Cholangiocarcinoma,Colorectal metastasis,Fibrolamellar HCC,Hepatocellular carcinoma,Biliary cystadenocarcinoma,A,73%,9%,9%,6%,3%,"Explanation:
Retraction of the liver capsule signifies the presence of fibrosis.
Differential diagnosis for hepatic capsular retraction:
Cholangiocarcinoma
Fibrolamellar HCC
Metastases (breast, lung, carcinoid, colorectal)
IgG4 related disease

Cirrhosis
  Retraction of the liver capsule, along with delayed enhancement are characteristic features of cholangiocarcinoma. The mass is usually infiltrative rather than having a well defined margin. Metastases to the lung are rare, but seen occasionally, manifesting as nodules. Primary sclerosing cholangitis is a major risk factor.
Colorectal liver metastasis have various appearances, but are usually hypoenhancing on portal venous phase and do not demonstrate delayed enhancement.
HCC would show arterial enhancement with washout compared to background liver.",FALSE,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most likely diagnosis for this patient based on the CT findings. The infiltrative mass is lower in attenuation than the background liver on the portal venous phase and demonstrates greater enhancement than the background liver on the delayed phase.

Select one answer only.,SBA: Central Nervous and Head & Neck,One muscle involved,Sudden onset,Involvement of lacrimal gland,Extraconal,Tendon enlargement,A,50%,11%,10%,10%,19%,"Explanation:
Distinguishing between Graves eye disease and IgG4 related orbital disease (previously termed pseudotumour, which is now considered a separate entity, albeit with overlapping features) should be relatively simple.
Graves eye disease starts with one muscle involved but can progress to involve others too. The mnemonic for remembering the order in which the eye muscles are affected in Graves eye disease is: I’m Slow (Inferior, Medial, Superior, Lateral). Otherwise the following table compares the features of the two conditions.
IgG4 related disease is a relatively newly developed concept with a number of radiological avenues.
  Graves Eye Disease
IgG4 related disease
Involves ONLY muscle, not tendons or other structures
Involves anything within the orbit; lacrimal gland, tendons → any part of the eye
Unilateral or bilateral

Intraorbital fat stranding
Painless
Painful
  Multiple associations including retroperitoneal fibrosis
Does respond to steroids
Responds dramatically to steroids
Slow onset
Sudden onset",FALSE,"The sudden onset of symptoms is a common feature of Graves disease, which is an autoimmune disorder that affects the eyes, whereas IgG4 related orbital disease is a chronic condition with a gradual onset.",2,"2. A question about clinical judgement, what is the correct diagnosis?",C,TRUE,"I chose option 4, ""One muscle involved,"" because Graves' disease, also known as thyroid eye disease, typically presents with the involvement of only one or few extraocular muscles, whereas IgG4-related orbital disease frequently involves multiple extraocular muscles. Additionally, in Graves' disease, the muscle involvement is often asymmetric, and the tendons are usually spared. This feature helps to differentiate Graves' disease from IgG4-related orbital disease, which tends to have more symmetrical involvement and may also affect the tendons.",A,FALSE,E

What is the most common cause of pancreatitis in the paediatric population?,SBA: Paediatrics,Trauma,Annular pancreas,Cystic fibrosis,Medications including steroids,Solid pseudopapillary tumour of the pancreas,A,60%,9%,22%,8%,1%,"Explanation:
Trauma is by far the most common cause of pancreatitis in the paediatric population. Handlebar injury and seatbelt injury are the most common type, but don’t forget the possibility of non-accidental injury too.
Annular pancreas usually presents in children as duodenal obstruction, whereas in adults pancreatitis is a more common presentation of this anatomical variant.
Cystic fibrosis causes complete fatty replacement of the pancreas or lipomatous pseudohypertrophy of the pancreas.
Pseudopapillary tumours of the pancreas are rare, benign tumours of the pancreas which usually present in females 15-30 years of age. Pancreatitis as a result of this tumour is possible, but not recognised as a regular complication.
Steroids are of course a possible cause of pancreatitis, but less common than trauma in children.",FALSE,"Annular pancreas is the most common cause of pancreatitis in the paediatric population. This is due to the abnormal formation of the pancreas during fetal development, which can cause a narrowing of the duodenum and compression of the pancreatic duct. This can lead to obstruction of pancreatic juices, resulting in inflammation and pain.",2,"This question would fall under the category of clinical judgement, what is the correct diagnosis?",B,FALSE,"I chose option 3, cystic fibrosis, because it is one of the most common causes of pancreatitis in the pediatric population. Cystic fibrosis is a genetic disorder that affects multiple organ systems, including the pancreas. It causes thick, sticky mucus to build up in the pancreas, leading to blockage of the pancreatic ducts and subsequent inflammation, resulting in pancreatitis. Other causes, such as trauma, annular pancreas, medications, and solid pseudopapillary tumors, may also lead to pancreatitis, but they are less common in children compared to cystic fibrosis.",C,FALSE,B
10616,201667,Which of the following features if noted on a CT abdominal angiogram would render an abdominal aortic aneurysm unsuitable for endovascular repair? Select one answer only.,SBA: Cardiothoracic and vascular,7mm infrarenal neck,Common iliac artery diameter of 10mm,Common iliac artery length of 20mm,Neck angle 100 deg,Iliac artery angle >90 deg,D,38%,9%,4%,30%,19%,"Explanation:
The angle of the neck should be either below 60deg or above 120deg depending on the system used to measure. 100deg falls outside of both of these systems.
For the most part it will be the vascular surgeons or interventional radiologists themselves who decide on a case-by-case basis whether they themselves are prepared to attempt endovascular repair of a given aneurysm. Broadly speaking however, there are a number of criteria which the surgeon or interventionalist would be wise to abide by:
Distance to the renal arteries – 10mm used to be the absolute minimum landing zone distance required but many of the grafts would required a minimum of 15mm. If the landing zone is less than 10mm a fenestrated graft must be used to preserve the patency of the renal arteries.
Angle of the neck – this is measured one of two ways in the literature. Consequently there are two different values for an acceptable angle. A purely straight aneurysm would have a neck angle of either 180o or 0o in each of the different measuring systems. Thus the acceptable neck cut-off values are 120o or 60o in each case.
Angle of the common iliac artery – fortunately this is easier to remember. Iliac arteries at 90o or worse are significantly harder to stent. Further consideration is usually given to the overall tortuosity of the iliac arteries but this relates to endovascular access as opposed to stent deployment.
Common iliac artery (CIA) length – Ideally the CIA should be longer than 20mm to accommodate the stents used. Shorter lengths may require landing in the external iliac artery with deliberate occlusion of the internal iliac artery and reliance on pelvic collaterals.
Common iliac artery diameter – Stents are difficult (not impossible) to place where the diameter of the CIA is less than 7mm. 
Some of these limitations are more flexible than others. Where limitations make stents 'difficult' or 'harder' to place, this does not entirely contra-indicate the procedure.",FALSE,"I chose number 5 because an iliac artery angle greater than 90 degrees is considered a contraindication for endovascular repair of an abdominal aortic aneurysm. This is because a large angle can make it difficult to access the aneurysm with a stent graft, and can also increase the risk of stent graft migration.",1,"This question falls under category 1: Basic factual recall, either of basic science, physics, anatomy or regarding a procedure.",E,TRUE,"I chose option 4 (Neck angle 100 deg) because it refers to the angle between the aneurysm and the aorta's normal course. In endovascular repair of abdominal aortic aneurysm (EVAR), a suitable neck angle is crucial for the proper placement and sealing of the stent graft. A neck angle of 100 degrees is considered unfavorable for EVAR, as it may lead to complications such as endoleaks, stent graft migration, or even failure of the repair. Generally, a neck angle of less than 60 degrees is preferred for endovascular repair.",D,TRUE,A
14416,201667,A 40-year-old man undergoes a CT scan of his chest. This shows thickening of the pericardium measuring around 5mm. The right ventricle is small and there is straightening of the interventricular septum. Ascites can be seen in the included upper abdomen. What is the SINGLE most likely diagnosis?,SBA: Cardiothoracic and vascular,Aortic dissection type A,Aortic dissection type B,Constrictive pericarditis,Lobar pulmonary emboli,Lymphoma,C,1%,1%,96%,2%,1%,"Explanation:
Constrictive pericarditis
Inflammation of the pericardium is termed pericarditis and leads to fibrous thickening. Most commonly this occurs either post-operatively in patients undergoing cardiac surgery or as an idiopathic entity although historically it was tuberculosis which was the most common cause of pericarditis. The diagnosis is predominantly clinical with symptoms such as malaise or dyspnoea and signs such as neck vein distension or paradoxical movement of the JVP. On cross sectional imaging thickening of the pericardium to greater than 2mm can be seen and the fibrosis causes a restriction in distensibility. The right ventricle, being more compliant than the left, becomes flattened and furthermore there can be straightening or curvature of the septum towards the left. Elsewhere, if the field of view permits, accessory signs such as pleural effusions and even ascites may be seen.
  Infectious pericarditis
Enhancement of the pericardium suggests active inflammation. Locules of gas within a pericardial effusion suggest the presence of gas forming organisms, though these are rarely seen. Fat stranding may be seen within the fat of the adjacent mediastinum.
  Pulmonary Emboli
There is some cross-over of the signs and symptoms of pericarditis and a large lobar embolus. On CT, if the embolus is large enough to cause right ventricular strain the septum can sometimes appear bowed with reflux of IV contrast into the hepatic veins.
  Aortic dissection
Dissections are classified according to their involvement of the aortic root and their distal extent. There are two different classification systems. The Stanford classification is more useful clinically since the primary decision post-diagnosis is whether the dissection will be managed surgically or medically. Those involving the proximal aorta and arch are managed surgically. If the arch is not involved, the patient can be managed medically. Thus, Stanford A dissections involve the aorta proximal to the origin of the left subclavian artery with or without concurrent distal involvement. Stanford B dissections do not involve the proximal aorta. Where a dissection extends proximally and causes pericardial tamponade the clinical signs and symptoms may well occur, however the presence of effusions and pitting oedema do not fit with the correct answer being aortic dissection.",TRUE,"Constrictive pericarditis is the most likely diagnosis because the CT scan shows thickening of the pericardium, which is one of the primary symptoms of this condition. Additionally, the CT scan also shows a small right ventricle and straightening of the interventricular septum, which are both associated with constrictive pericarditis. Ascites in the upper abdomen can also be seen in cases of constrictive pericarditis, making it the most likely diagnosis.",2,,C,TRUE,"I chose option 3, Constrictive pericarditis, because the clinical findings described in the question are consistent with this diagnosis. 

Thickening of the pericardium measuring around 5mm: In constrictive pericarditis, the pericardium becomes thickened and fibrotic, which can be seen on a CT scan. A normal pericardium is usually less than 2mm thick, so a measurement of 5mm is suggestive of thickening.

The right ventricle is small and there is straightening of the interventricular septum: In constrictive pericarditis, the thickened and fibrotic pericardium restricts the diastolic filling of the heart, leading to reduced ventricular sizes, especially the right ventricle. The straightening of the interventricular septum is also a sign of ventricular interdependence, which occurs in constrictive pericarditis.

Ascites can be seen in the included upper abdomen: Constrictive pericarditis can lead to increased central venous pressure, which in turn can cause fluid accumulation in the abdomen, known as ascites.

The other options are less likely based on the given findings:

1. Aortic dissection type A and 2. Aortic dissection type B: These conditions involve a tear in the aortic wall and would typically present with acute chest pain and radiological findings such as an intimal flap or dilated aorta, which are not mentioned in the question.

4. Lobar pulmonary emboli: This condition involves a blood clot in the pulmonary arteries and would present with acute shortness of breath, chest pain, and findings such as filling defects in the pulmonary arteries on imaging, which are not mentioned in the question.

5. Lymphoma: While lymphoma can involve the pericardium, it would not typically cause the specific findings described in the question, such as a small right ventricle and straightening of the interventricular septum. Additionally, lymphadenopathy would be expected in a lymphoma case, which is not mentioned in the question.",C,FALSE,D
10551,201667,A 65-year-old man is one day post-op from a stent graft repair of an infra-renal aneurysm. He undergoes a CT angiogram that shows a clear blush of contrast near the end of the stent graft.What kind of leak is this? What kind of leak is this?,SBA: Cardiothoracic and vascular,Endoleak type I,Endoleak type II,Endoleak type IV,Exoleak type I,Exoleak type II,A,68%,11%,3%,13%,4%,"Explanation:
Type I endoleaks occur at the landing zones of the stent, either proximally or distally.
Type II endoleaks are the most common and occur when there is collateral filling of the aneurysm sac, usually via the lumbar arteries or retrograde via the inferior mesenteric artery via the marginal artery of Drummond. The need for intervention is usually determined by growth in sac size. Where a leak is stable, with no growth in sac size, intervention is not always necessary and the leak should resolve with time. If the sac does continue to expand the culprit lumbar artery could be embolised via an endovascular technique.
Type III endoleaks occur due to a defect in the wall of the graft that can be mechanical or iatrogenic.
Type IV endoleaks occur due to porosity of the graft material
Type V endoleaks are a ‘catch all’ classification often thought to occur due an unidentified type I-IV leak.",TRUE,"Endoleak type I is the type of leak that occurs when there is a breach in the stent graft wall, allowing blood to flow through the defect and out of the stent graft. This is the type of leak seen in the CT angiogram, as the contrast is seen near the end of the stent graft.",2,3. A question about the interpretation of medical images.,B,TRUE,"I chose Endoleak type I because the scenario describes a patient who recently underwent a stent graft repair for an infra-renal aneurysm and has a CT angiogram showing a contrast blush near the end of the stent graft. This suggests that blood is leaking around the attachment site of the stent graft, which is characteristic of an Endoleak type I.

Endoleak type I occurs when there is an incomplete seal at the attachment sites of the stent graft, either proximally (type IA) or distally (type IB). This allows blood to continue to flow into the aneurysm sac, increasing the risk of rupture. It is considered a high-pressure leak and usually requires urgent intervention to prevent complications.",A,TRUE,A

An ultrasound demonstrates an absent spleen. The baby then undergoes echocardiogram which demonstrates a ventricular septal defect. What other finding on the echocardiogram is most likely?,SBA: Cardiothoracic and vascular,Tricuspid atresia,Aortic stenosis,Aortic regurgitation,Mitral stenosis,Mitral regurgitation,A,57%,9%,6%,13%,14%,"Explanation:
Tricuspid atresia
This occurs with right ventricular hypoplasia (and often ASD or PFO) as part of a congenital abnormality. It can also be associated with asplenia.
  Mitral regurgitation
Chronic regurgitation causes left atrial enlargement with splaying of the carina and a double right heart border. It is also the only valvular pathology associated with isolated right upper lobe pulmonary oedema.
  Aortic stenosis
This can be congenital or acquired. Dilation of ascending aorta is seen due to a jet from the stenosis. Concentric left ventricular hypertrophy is occasionally a feature.
  Aortic regurgitation
This is usually secondary to bacterial endocarditis, Marfan’s, bicuspid aortic valve or aortic root dilatation (due to hypertension).
  Mitral stenosis
The most common cause of mitral stenosis is rheumatic heart disease. It can cause left atrial dilatation, but is not associated with right upper lobe pulmonary oedema.",TRUE,"Tricuspid atresia is a congenital heart defect in which the tricuspid valve is absent or not properly formed. This defect is often associated with cardiomegaly, an absent spleen, and a ventricular septal defect. Therefore, it is the most likely finding on the echocardiogram based on the given information.",2,"3. A question about the application of knowledge, what is the best treatment?

This question falls under Category 2: A question about clinical judgement, what is the correct diagnosis?",E,FALSE,"I chose option 1, Aortic stenosis, because the clinical scenario provided suggests the baby may have a congenital heart defect. The combination of cardiomegaly, ventricular septal defect, and the absence of a spleen indicates a possible association with a congenital heart condition called ""Shone's complex"" or ""Shone's syndrome.""

Shone's complex is a rare congenital heart disease characterized by a combination of left-sided heart lesions, which typically include:

1. Aortic stenosis (narrowing of the aortic valve)
2. Coarctation of the aorta (narrowing of the aorta)
3. Ventricular septal defect (a hole between the lower chambers of the heart)
4. Mitral stenosis or parachute mitral valve (narrowing of the mitral valve)

In this case, the presence of a ventricular septal defect and the other clinical findings make aortic stenosis the most likely additional finding on the echocardiogram.",B,FALSE,B

Lipoma arborescens
This condition can affect children or adults and is thought to be a reaction to chronic inflammation of the synovium leading to extensive fatty infiltration of the synovium. It is almost always the knee which is affected. Plain radiographs will show only an effusion, which may be large, but on MRI there is frond-like or nodular synovial proliferation which returns fat-signal according to the different sequences used. The signal should be high on T1 and T2 but suppress on fat-saturated sequences. Post-contrast the synovium itself will enhance. Treatment is by synovectomy.",TRUE,The correct answer is 3. Frond-like proliferation of the synovium with high T1 and T2 signal. Lipoma arborescens is a condition where the synovial membrane becomes thickened and filled with fat. This is seen on MRI as frond-like proliferation of the synovium with high T1 and T2 signal. This is because the fat is hyperintense on T1 and T2 weighted images.,2,"3. A question about application of knowledge, what is the best course of action?

This question falls under category 2: A question about clinical judgement, what is the correct diagnosis?",D,TRUE,"I chose option 4 because lipoma arborescens is a rare benign lesion characterized by a frond-like proliferation of the synovium. It is composed of mature adipose tissue, which has high signal intensity on both T1-weighted and T2-weighted MRI sequences. This is due to the high fat content in lipoma arborescens, which leads to the characteristic high signal on T1 and T2 images.

What is the most likely diagnosis?","SBA: Genito urinary, Adrenal, Obstetrics & Gynaecology and Breast",Phyllodes tumour,Fibroid,Abscess,Galactocoele,Radial scar,A,57%,33%,2%,3%,5%,"Explanation:
A Phyllodes tumour
These would typically be described as having a similar appearance to a fibroadenoma. They would usually appear as a lobulated round hypoechoic mass with ill-defined borders and a posterior acoustic enhancement. Occasionally they can demonstrate a ‘halo’ sign. Patients are usually middle aged, slightly older than those with a fibroadenoma.
  Fibroadenoma
Popcorn calcification is pathognomonic of a fibroadenoma. They tend to be nodular or lobulated in contour but with smooth margins. They often show a ‘halo’ sign of low attenuation where tissue surrounding the lesion has been compressed. Patients are usually relatively young; 20s or 30s.
  Galactocoele
A galactocoele appears during lactation as an enlarging painless mass. A fat-fluid level is a specific finding on a lateral view. These lesions would be far more likely to be ultrasound diagnoses than mammographic. They can have a variety of appearances, ranging from cystic with internal debris, to solid appearing masses. Posterior acoustic is an important feature which suggests a fluid component to the mass. Diagnosis is typically confirmed by aspirating milk from the lesion.
  Breast abscess
Clinical manifestations notwithstanding, would appear cystic on ultrasound.
  Radial scar
The classic description of a radial scar used to be in a patient with prior breast surgery. Actually, there is no association with prior surgery. Around half are associated with a carcinoma and hence management is usually surgical excision.",TRUE,"Phyllodes tumours are the most common type of soft tissue breast lesion in women aged over 65. They are typically well-defined, oval-shaped, and composed of both benign and malignant cells. Phyllodes tumours can also be associated with a lump in the breast, which makes it the most likely diagnosis in this case.",2,,A,FALSE,"I chose option 2, an abscess, because it is a relatively common cause of a lump in the breast, especially in a 65-year-old lady. An abscess is a collection of pus within the breast tissue, which can be caused by infection or inflammation.

Select ONE answer only.,SBA: Gastrointestinal,Ileus,Ulcerative colitis,Crohn's disease,Ischaemic colitis,Amoebiasis,A,55%,2%,14%,6%,22%,"Explanation:
Please note that the question asks which answer is NOT a differential diagnosis.
Toxic megacolon
This term, often ascribed loosely, is actually only attributable to cases where there is acute transmural colitis. Loss of motor tone leads to colonic dilatation to more than 5.5cm and widespread mucosal sloughing occurs. Consequentially there is loss of the normal mucosal pattern and haustration; this would usually be appreciated best on a barium study however can also be demonstrated on an abdominal radiograph or CT scan. A barium enema, or any other colorectal instrumentation, would be contra-indicated. The patient usually has severe bloody diarrhoea and is at significant risk of perforation. The condition carries a 20% mortality rate. The management varies according to aetiology. Surgical exploration should be used only if absolutely necessary for patients with inflammatory bowel disease; these patients are likely to require multiple abdominal surgeries throughout their life. Steroids, immunosuppressives and biologics should be used where possible.
Ulcerative colitis is the most common cause of toxic megacolon.
  Differential diagnoses of megacolon © Medical Exam Prep
  Distinguishing a toxic megacolon from a non-toxic megacolon is important as the management changes dramatically. Loss of haustration with thumbprinting and/or a known history of inflammatory bowel disease, or vasculopathy, or a positive stool culture are strong indicators that this may be a toxic megacolon.",FALSE,"I chose 4. Ischaemic colitis as the answer because toxic megacolon is a severe form of colonic distention, usually caused by an inflammatory process, such as ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, or amoebiasis. Ischemic colitis, on the other hand, is caused by a lack of oxygen to the colon due to obstruction of the blood supply, and is not a differential diagnosis for toxic megacolon.",2,"This question falls under category 2: A question about clinical judgement, what is the correct diagnosis?",A,TRUE,"I chose option 1, ""Ileus,"" because it is not a differential diagnosis for toxic megacolon. Toxic megacolon is a severe complication of inflammatory bowel diseases, such as ulcerative colitis (option 2) and Crohn's disease (option 3), as well as infectious colitis like amoebiasis (option 5) and ischemic colitis (option 4). These conditions can cause inflammation and damage to the colon, leading to its dilation.

On the other hand, ileus is a non-mechanical obstruction of the intestines. It is a functional disorder that results from a lack of coordinated peristalsis, which can be caused by various factors, such as surgery, electrolyte imbalances, or medications. Ileus does not involve the inflammation and damage to the colon seen in toxic megacolon, so it is not a differential diagnosis for this condition.",A,FALSE,C
14133,201667,"A 72-year-old man is undergoing pre-operative assessment prior to a routine TURP procedure for some troublesome lower urinary tract symptoms. When his PSA is found to be markedly elevated he undergoes an MRI scan for further investigation. A 12mm tumour is seen in the left peripheral zone. It returns low signal on the T2 weighted sequences, with some very low signal on the ADC sequence too. Which of the following could cause a falsely reassuring PSA density? Select ONE answer only.","SBA: Genito urinary, Adrenal, Obstetrics & Gynaecology and Breast",NSAID use,Prostatitis,Urinary tract infection,Recent intercourse,Recent arduous cycle ride,A,74%,14%,2%,7%,3%,"Explanation:
The PSA is usually considered elevated when levels exceed 4ng/L. A number of things can artificially elevate the PSA and in many cases of an incidental elevated PSA once these have been excluded the PSA returns to normal. Patients should be counselled to avoid activities which could lead to an elevated PSA for at least 48hrs prior to the test.

Digital rectal examination  
Benign prostatic hyperplasia  
  The PSA density is calculated by taking the PSA and dividing it by the volume of the prostate. The volume is calculated as: Height x Length x Depth x π/6 (the volume of an ellipsoid). It accounts for the increase in size of the prostate which occurs in many men with increasing age and allows a far more comparable indication of the likelihood of malignancy. 0.1 is considered a normal PSA density value. Prostate cancers are usually seen in those with a prostate density of >0.1ng/ml/cc.
If a radiologist is reviewing a scan for a patient with a PSA density >0.1 and is unable to identify a prostatic malignancy then either they should review the scan more closely, or the PSA value could be repeated following appropriate instructions to the patient regarding cessation of PSA elevating activities prior to the test.",TRUE,"NSAID use can cause a false PSA density because it can reduce the amount of PSA in the blood, resulting in a lower PSA density. This can lead to a falsely reassuring result, as the lower PSA density may not accurately reflect the presence of a tumor.",1,"3.

This question would fall under category 3: A question about clinical reasoning, what would be the best course of action?",A,FALSE,"I chose option 2, prostatitis, because it is a condition that can cause a falsely reassuring PSA density. Prostatitis is an inflammation of the prostate gland, and when it is inflamed, it can produce less PSA (prostate-specific antigen). This can lead to a lower PSA density reading, giving a false impression that the prostate is healthier than it actually is. This can be misleading in cases where there is an underlying prostate cancer, as it may not be detected promptly due to the falsely reassuring PSA density.",B,FALSE,D

14536,201667,A 32-year-old man presents to his GP with troubling joint pains. He mentions suffering from food poisoning during his recent holiday abroad. On examination there is no rash and his HLA-B27 comes back as positive. His GP requests some x-rays which show bilateral asymmetrical sacroiliitis and paravertebral ossification. What is the most likely diagnosis? Select ONE answer only.,SBA: Musculoskeletal and Trauma,Reiter syndrome,Psoriatic arthropathy,Enteropathic arthropathy,Juvenile rheumatoid arthritis,Ankylosing spondylitis,A,40%,10%,37%,0%,14%,"Explanation:
Seronegative arthritides - These are negative for Rheumatoid factor but have a strong association with HLA-B27 positivity.
Ankylosing spondylitis - 95%
Enteropathic arthropathy - 90%
Psoriatic arthritis - 80%
Chronic reactive arthritis - 70%
  Chronic reactive arthritis (Reiter syndrome)
This disease is said to present as a triad of arthritis, conjunctivitis/uveitis and urethritis/cervicitis (Can't see, can't pee, can't climb a tree) however in reality only around a third of patients present with all three symptoms. Patients are usually aged 16-60 years. It has a reasonably strong male predominance but does occur in women. It can occur following infection with chlamydia, but also with gastrointestinal infections such as salmonella, shigella, campylobacter and yersinia. Most (>2/3rds) of patients are HLA-B27 positive.
Bilateral asymmetrical sacroiliitis
Paravertebral ossification - similar to syndesmophytes but in theory are seen separately from the disc, bridging around it. Most commonly in the thoracolumbar spine.
Enthesopathy - particularly at achilles tendon insertion, interspinous ligaments, and pelvic ligaments.
  Enteropathic arthropathy
This occurs in a subsect of patients with inflammatory or infective bowel disease. Roughly 10-20% of patients with Crohn’s or ulcerative colitis suffer from enteropathic arthropathy. Like chronic reactive arthropathy, it can also occur in the context of salmonella, shigella and yersinia infections. Appearances are very similar to those of ankylosing spondylitis; the two can be very difficult to separate radiologically.
Bilateral symmetrical sacroillitis
Enthesopathy
Vertebral syndesmophytes
Fusion of spinous processes
  Psoriatic arthropathy
Around a fifth of patients with psoriasis develop arthropathy and it is also possible to suffer from psoriatic arthropathy in the absence of the typical psoriatic cutaneous plaques. Around 80% of patients are HLA-B27 positive.
Importantly, on x-ray there are findings of both erosive changes in addition to productive changes with periosteal new bone formation. The combination of the two contrives to leave a ‘pencil-in-cup’ appearance. The joints can appear fluffy due to the exuberance of new bone formation.
The differential diagnosis for periosteal reactions in the presence of an arthropathy is relatively narrow and very specific:
Psoriatic arthropathy
Juvenile rheumatoid arthritis
Reiter syndrome
Infective arthropathy
  Although often classified as a distal arthropathy, preferring the DIPs to the MCPs, psoriatic arthropathy does also affect the spine and SI joints frequently. ‘Sausage digits’ is a term used to describe the diffuse soft tissue swelling which can affect the fingers and toes. Osteoporosis does occur but is a feature of later disease.
  Ankylosing spondylitis
This disease usually presents in early adulthood with gradual onset of back pain. There is a male preponderance, though it can affect women too. The vast majority (>90%) of patients are HLA-B27 positive. Radiologically the late features are classical with:
Bilateral symmetrical sacroiliitis
Enthesopathy - calcified tendon insertion sites
Bamboo spine - vertebral syndesmophytes, particularly in the thoracolumbar spine
Dagger sign - spinous process fusion
Erosion, then fusion at the symphysis pubis, costochondral, costovertebral and sternoclavicular joints
Thoracic manifestations: upper lobe pulmonary fibrosis, pericarditis, aortic root dilatation
  Early features are far more subtle and require a higher index of suspicion.
Enthesopathy - high signal on MRI at tendon insertion sites
Romanus lesions - triangular shaped oedema at the corners of vertebral bodies
Andersson lesions - bony oedema in the vertebral bodies adjacent to the disks.
Oedema in the sacroiliac joints.
  Patients with advanced ankylosing spondylitis are at increased risk of pathological fractures due to fusion. These can be pelvic fractures following a simple fall, or chance fractures of the spine (involving all three columns - in ankylosing spondylitis, these fractures are also sometimes termed chalk-stick or carrot fractures).
  Juvenile idiopathic arthritis
This condition used to be termed juvenile rheumatoid arthritis. It is a cluster of similar conditions affecting patients under the age of 16.
The affected joints show:
Effusions
Erosions
Cartilage destruction
  Epiphyseal overgrowth secondary to reactive hyperaemia occurs owing to the immature nature of the skeleton. Premature physeal closure can result in limb length discrepancies in adulthood.
Large joints are typically affected first and the small joints of the hands and feet are affected later on.
Image © Medical Exam Prep",FALSE,"Ankylosing spondylitis is the most likely diagnosis because the patient has a positive HLA-B27 test result and x-rays showing bilateral asymmetrical sacroiliitis and paravertebral ossification. These are common signs and symptoms of ankylosing spondylitis. Furthermore, the patient's recent history of food poisoning may be related to the development of ankylosing spondylitis, as this is a known risk factor for the condition.",2,,E,TRUE,"I chose Reiter syndrome (also known as Reactive arthritis) because the patient's presentation and test results align with the typical features of this condition. Reactive arthritis is known to occur following an infection, such as food poisoning, which the patient experienced during his recent holiday abroad. The presence of joint pain and a positive HLA-B27 test result further support this diagnosis. Additionally, the x-ray findings of bilateral asymmetrical sacroiliitis and paravertebral ossification are consistent with Reiter syndrome. Although some of the other options may share similar features, the combination of infection history, joint pain, positive HLA-B27, and x-ray findings make Reiter syndrome the most likely diagnosis.",A,FALSE,E
14273,201667,You are performing a contrast enhanced ultrasound scan on a patient. There is a 3cm lesion in the left lobe of the liver. Which of the following is correctly matched with its likely diagnosis? Select ONE answer only.,SBA: Gastrointestinal,Immediate uniform enhancement which washes out - malignant lesion,Peripheral nodular enhancement with gradual filling in - flash haemangioma,Spoke wheel enhancement of a central scar - fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma,Gradual uniform enhancement - haemangioma,Arterial enhancement with a non-enhancing central scar - focal nodular hyperplasia,A,66%,7%,5%,8%,14%,"Explanation:
The correct pairings are as follows:
Immediate uniform enhancement which washes out - malignant lesion
Peripheral nodular enhancement with gradual filling in - haemangioma
Spoke wheel enhancement of a central scar - focal nodular hyperplasia
Gradual uniform enhancement - benign lesion
Arterial enhancement with a non-enhancing central scar - fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma
  Contrast enhanced ultrasound (CEUS)
CEUS is cheaper than MRI and confers less risk to the patient. The patient is injected with a contrast agent consisting of tiny microbubbles measuring micrometers in diameter. These circulate within the patient and when insonated cause strong reflections which show up as hyperechogenicity in real time as the bubbles wash in and out of the field of view. The microbubbles burst in time and the process can be repeated within a few minutes if required. There is no renal toxicity and adverse reactions are very rare meaning this is a safe procedure for almost all patients. The most significant limitation is the location of the lesion; if the lesion cannot be seen with B-mode ultrasound then it cannot be interrogated with CEUS.
It is a useful technique particularly for differentiating between malignant lesions (which tend to washout rapidly owing to their high vascularity), and benign lesions but is also useful for characterising benign lesions such as haemangiomata or focal nodular hyperplasia by demonstrating the same enhancement patterns which would otherwise be expected on an MRI.
The technique, having been developed with liver lesions in mind, is now being expanded to renal lesions, testicular masses and vascular work too, among others.
As a general rule, if the lesion can be seen on ultrasound, it can be investigated with CEUS however lesions smaller than 10mm are often challenging in this regard. In any case, an anechoic lesion (i.e. a cyst) needs no further investigation. Lesions close to the diaphragm (Segments VII and VIII in particular) are difficult to see with ultrasound at the best of times.",FALSE,"I chose number 4 because haemangiomas typically demonstrate gradual uniform enhancement, with peripheral nodular enhancement and gradual filling in. This is the most likely diagnosis for a lesion with a 3cm size in the left lobe of the liver.",2,,D,FALSE,"I chose option 4 because it best matches the characteristics of focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH). FNH is a benign liver lesion, and its typical imaging features on contrast-enhanced ultrasound include arterial enhancement with a non-enhancing central scar. These features help distinguish FNH from other liver lesions, such as haemangiomas or malignant lesions.",E,FALSE,B

Which of the following would be best to confirm this diagnosis? Select ONE answer only.,SBA: Central Nervous and Head & Neck,I-123 Ioflupane DAT,18F-FDG PET,Tc99m - HMPAO SPECT,MRI with contrast,CT pre and post contrast,A,72%,11%,13%,3%,0%,"Explanation:
Parkinson's disease
Generalised cerebral atrophy occurs with Parkinson's disease but is a highly non-specific feature. There are, however, radiological findings in the midbrain which although subtle, are far more specific. Parkinson's disease occurs when there is neuronal loss in the substantia nigra, specifically the pars compacta of the substantia nigra. On a T2 weighted MRI image this appears as blurring of the intermediate signal intensity line which separates the two adjacent low intensity structures (these are the pars reticulata of the substantia nigra and the red nucleus).
A DAT scan (Dopamine Active Transfer) can be performed to confirm the diagnosis. This uses the radiopharmaceutical I-123 Ioflupane to image dopamine transporters in the brain. These are present in the highest concentrations in the putamina and caudate nuclei. In patients with true Parkinson's disease (as opposed to other similar conditions), there will be loss of uptake in the posterior putamen. This can be an asymmetric finding. Colloquially speaking the appearance of these areas on a normal patient resembles a comma and on a patient with Parkinson's disease they become more like full stops.

 ",TRUE,"I chose 4. I-123 Ioflupane DAT because it is the most commonly used imaging test to diagnose Parkinson's disease. It is a type of single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) scan that can provide detailed images of the brain's dopamine transporter activity. This activity is reduced in Parkinson's disease, making it an effective way to diagnose the condition.",2,"3.

This question falls under category 2: A question about clinical judgement, what is the correct diagnosis?",D,TRUE,"I chose option 2, I-123 Ioflupane DAT, because it is a specific imaging technique used to assess the integrity of the dopamine transporter system in the brain. In Parkinson's disease, there is a significant loss of dopamine-producing neurons, which leads to the symptoms observed in the patient. I-123 Ioflupane DAT, also known as DaTscan, can help visualize the dopamine transporter levels in the brain and provide valuable information to support the diagnosis of Parkinson's disease. The other options are less specific or not directly related to assessing the dopaminergic system in the context of Parkinson's disease.",A,TRUE,A
13802,205045,A 6-month-old girl undergoes an MRI scan under sedation for investigation of severe developmental delay. The scan shows multiple periventricular calcifications.

A lack of information is as fustrating in practice questions as it is in the exam. In these situations it is important to use any information you have been provided.
  CMV
This is by far the most common TORCH infection (almost twice as common as all the others put together). Periventricular calcification is the most common finding. It is also commonly associated with polymicrogyria.
  HSV
Haemorrhagic infarction is a prominent feature of HSV, with subsequent encephalomalacia. It is usually HSV-2 rather than HSV-1.
  Rubella
Focal high signal in the white matter is the most common finding.
  Toxoplasmosis
Toxoplasmosis is a reasonable suggestion if there is hydrocephalus with the calcifications. Toxoplasmosis is the second most common TORCH infection after CMV.
  HIV
Frontal predominant atrophy is the main feature with basal ganglia calcification.",FALSE,"HIV is the most likely underlying diagnosis in this case because periventricular calcifications are a common sign of congenital HIV infection. In addition, severe developmental delay is a common symptom of congenital HIV infection.",2,,A,TRUE,"I chose option 3, CMV (Cytomegalovirus), because periventricular calcifications are a characteristic finding in congenital CMV infection. CMV is a common cause of congenital infection and can lead to severe developmental delay in affected infants.

In the days following a denervation injury there will be oedema giving high T2 signal.
Some atrophic changes may be present coexistant with so-called acute inflammation. As the denervation progresses, the atrophy will become more pronounced with time.
High signal on T2 and low on T1 suggests acute inflammation which is the most likely finding during early recovery.
  Low signal on T2 and high signal on T1 suggests chronic fatty replacement which could be expected at approximately 18 months post-op.
  The other answers given are non-specific.",FALSE,"The MRI scan is likely to show high signal on both T1 and T2 due to the atrophy of the left side of the tongue. Atrophy is the loss of cells and tissue, which can lead to a decrease in the amount of water and other substances in the tissue, resulting in a high signal on both T1 and T2.",1,"3. A question about nursing care, what is the best course of action?

This question falls under category 2: A question about clinical judgement, what is the correct diagnosis?",A,TRUE,"I chose option 2 (High signal on T2 and low on T1) because the MRI findings described in the question are consistent with muscle atrophy and denervation. The patient has undergone a radical neck dissection, which could have caused damage to the nerves supplying the tongue muscles, leading to atrophy.

In the case of muscle atrophy and denervation, the MRI signal changes typically show a high signal on T2-weighted images and a low signal on T1-weighted images. The high signal on T2 is due to increased water content in the affected muscle, while the low signal on T1 represents fatty infiltration and muscle fiber loss. These signal changes are consistent with the clinical presentation of the patient, who is experiencing difficulty swallowing and speaking.",A,FALSE,B

What is the most likely diagnosis?,SBA: Central Nervous and Head & Neck,DeQuervain thyroiditis,Graves disease,Hashimoto thyroiditis,Follicular carcinoma,Papillary carcinoma,A,74%,4%,21%,1%,1%,"Explanation:
DeQuervain thyroiditis is a lymphocytic infiltration of the thyroid with a likely viral aetiology. Nuclear medicine scanning usually shows diffuse low uptake.",FALSE,"I chose Graves disease because it is the most common cause of thyrotoxicosis, and it often presents with diffusely low uptake on a nuclear medicine scan. It is also more likely to occur in younger individuals, which is consistent with the age of the patient in this case.",2,,B,TRUE,"I chose DeQuervain thyroiditis (option 3) as the most likely diagnosis because the patient's presentation and nuclear medicine scan findings align with this condition. 

DeQuervain thyroiditis, also known as subacute thyroiditis or granulomatous thyroiditis, is an inflammatory thyroid disorder that often follows a viral respiratory infection. This matches the patient's recent history of having a respiratory infection in the past few weeks.

Additionally, the nuclear medicine scan showed diffusely low uptake, which is a characteristic finding in DeQuervain thyroiditis. In this condition, the inflammation of the thyroid gland leads to a transient release of thyroid hormones, causing thyrotoxicosis (high levels of thyroid hormones in the blood). However, the damaged thyroid gland is unable to take up the radioactive iodine used in the nuclear medicine scan, leading to the observed low uptake.

In contrast, Graves' disease and Hashimoto thyroiditis typically present with diffuse high uptake and patchy uptake, respectively, on nuclear medicine scans. Follicular and papillary carcinomas are types of thyroid cancer and would not be expected to cause diffuse low uptake on a nuclear medicine scan or be associated with a recent respiratory infection.",A,TRUE,A
13834,205045,"A 45-year-old lady presents with shortness of breath. Her chest radiograph demonstrates features consistent with pulmonary hypertension. She undergoes an echocardiogram and subsequent cardiac MRI scan which demonstrates bi-atrial dilatation with a normal ventricular size. On the black blood sequences, the radiographer mentions they are having difficulty suppressing the myocardium. What is the most likely underlying diagnosis?",SBA: Cardiothoracic and vascular,Amyloid,TB,Eosinophilic cardiomyopathy,Sarcoidosis,Atrial fibrillation,A,75%,1%,10%,8%,6%,"Explanation:
Amyloid
This is the most common cause of restrictive cardiomyopathy. There is often diffuse subendocardial delayed gadolinium enhancement; this is a classic feature. Cardiac MRI studies on patients with amyloid cardiomyopathy can often be technically very challenging to perform.
  A small amount of physics for imaging of patients with cardiac amyloidosis
Amyloid deposition leads to fibrosis and, as a general rule, fibrotic processes contain little water. On MRI scans therefore, most fibrotic entities return little signal on any sequence. Additionally, in many patients with amyloid cardiomyopathy, gadolinium washes out of the myocardium far faster than normally occurs. Both these features combine to the extent that the blood within the heart becomes very dark (due to higher than usual concentrations of gadolinium washed out from the myocardium) but at the same time the signal from the myocardium is very low due to the presence of fibrosis. Nulling the signal from the myocardium (to try to better visualise the affected areas of myocardium) therefore becomes difficult since the null point for both the blood pool and the myocardium is almost the same.
  Loeffler’s syndrome (eosinophilic cardiomyopathy)
Biventricular ventricular thrombus with endocardial fibrosis is a classical description of this condition. It can cause both a restrictive cardiomyopathy and valvular pathology. Elevation of serum eosinophil levels is another feature.
  TB
TB can affect the pericardium and result in constrictive cardiomyopathy. It can also affect the myocardium and give a nodular appearance to the myocardium on T1.
  Sarcoidosis
This usually causes nodular midwall late gadolinium enhancement, particularly affecting the base of the septum.
  Atrial Fibrillation
This can cause biatrial dilatation, but is not associated with the other features.",FALSE,"I chose number 2 because eosinophilic cardiomyopathy is a rare disorder characterized by an accumulation of eosinophils in the heart muscle, which can lead to myocardial dysfunction and difficulty suppressing the myocardium on black blood sequences. It is also associated with bi-atrial dilatation and normal ventricular size, which were both seen on the patient's cardiac MRI scan.",2,,C,TRUE,"I chose option 3, amyloid, because the given information in the scenario is consistent with the features of cardiac amyloidosis. The presence of bi-atrial dilatation with normal ventricular size suggests that there is an infiltrative process affecting the myocardium, leading to restrictive filling and increased atrial pressures. 

Additionally, the difficulty in suppressing the myocardium on black blood sequences during the cardiac MRI is a common finding in amyloidosis due to the infiltration of amyloid proteins in the myocardium, which alters the signal characteristics of the tissue. This makes it challenging to differentiate between the myocardium and the blood pool, resulting in poor suppression of the myocardial signal.

While some of the other options might also be associated with bi-atrial dilatation, the combination of the MRI findings and clinical presentation make amyloidosis the most likely diagnosis in this case.",A,FALSE,E

A Meckel’s diverticulum is a vestigial remnant of the vitellointestinal duct. It is the commonest malformation of the gastrointestinal tract, being present in around 2% of the population. They are twice as common in men than women.
When present a Meckel’s diverticulum is located in the distal ileum, usually within 60-100 cm (2 feet) of the ileocaecal valve. They are usually 3-6 cm (approx. 2 inches) long and may have a greater lumen than that of the ileum.
They are commonly found as an incidental finding, particularly at appendicectomy. The majority are asymptomaticbut they can present with the following complications:
Haemorrhage (25-50% of complications)
Intestinal obstruction (10-40% of complications)
Diverticulitis
Perforation
  Meckel’s diverticula run antimesenterically but receive their blood supply from the mesentery of the ileum, and a typical feeding vessel called the vitelline artery can be identified. They are typically lined with ileal mucosa but frequently contain ectopic mucosa, the two commonest types being gastric (50%) and pancreatic (5%). More rarely colonic or jejunal mucosa may be present.

Particularly when of low staging at resection, these tumours carry an excellent prognosis. Unfortunately around half of patients present with metastatic disease owing to the relatively indolent nature of the primary lesion. Tumour histology is used to guide follow up and newer antibody therapies have also improved outcomes significantly.
70% of GISTs occur in the stomach with most of the remainder being found in the small bowel. Clinical presentation varies slightly with the exact location but dysphagia and early satiety are common, as are sequelae from mucosal ulceration and bleeding. They can occur as a feature of neurofibromatosis type 1 and are also discussed in connection to the Carney triad (Not to be confused with Carney syndrome). On imaging they may be occult or appear as a well-circumscribed submucosal mass. The low attenuation is attributable to central necrosis within the mass. Characteristically however they tend to enlarge extraluminally into the lesser sac, gastrosplenic or gastrohepatic ligaments. Of note, lymph node enlargement is specifically not a feature and an alternative diagnosis should be sought if lymph node enlargement is present.

Which SINGLE statement regarding the carpal tunnel is true?",SBA: Musculoskeletal and Trauma,The tendon of flexor pollicis longus is surrounded by its own synovial sheath,The extensor retinaculum forms the floor of the tunnel,The ulnar artery passes deep to the tunnel,It lies on the dorsal side of the wrist,It contains three flexor tendons,A,80%,4%,5%,2%,9%,"Explanation:
The carpal tunnel is a passageway on the palmar side of the wrist that connects the forearm to the middle compartment of the deep plane of the hand.
The carpal tunnel is formed by two layers, the carpal arch and the flexor retinaculum:
1. The carpal arch forms the floor of the carpal tunnel. It is concave on the palmar side and is formed laterally by the scaphoid and trapezium tubercles and medially by the hook of the hamate and the pisiform bones.
2. The flexor retinaculum forms the roof of the carpal tunnel. It is a strong, fibrous band that covers the carpal bones on the palmar side of the hand near the wrist. It is attached medially to the pisiform bone and the hook of the hamate bone. Laterally it attaches to the tubercle of the scaphoid bone, and to the medial part of the trapezium bone.
The carpal tunnel contains a total of nine flexor tendons (but not the muscles themselves), surrounded by a synovial sheath, and the median nerve. The tendons contained within the carpal tunnel are:
Flexor digitorum profundus (four tendons)
Flexor digitorum superficialis (four tendons)
Flexor pollicis longus (one tendon)
  The eight tendons of the flexor digitorum profundus and superficialis are surrounded by a single synovial sheath, whereas the tendon of flexor pollicis longus is surrounded by its own synovial sheath. These sheaths allow free movement of the tendons
The tendon of flexor carpi radialis does not pass through the carpal tunnel, but is instead located within the flexor retinaculum itself.
The ulnar artery and ulnar nerve pass superficial to the flexor retinaculum and the carpal tunnel, passing through the ulnar tunnel.
Carpal tunnel syndrome is an entrapment neuropathy of the median nerve. It causes weakness and parasthesia in the distribution of the median nerve. The muscles innervated by the median nerve can be remembered using the mnemonic ‘LOAF’:
L – lateral two lumbricals
O – Opponens pollicis
A – Abductor pollicis
F – Flexor pollicis brevis

Film rotation
Unfortunately it is more likely that technical features will cause unilateral hyperlucency than any of the pathological conditions which may feature in the differential diagnosis. Rotation of the patient to the right on a PA film will bring the right hemithorax away from the plate. The chest anatomy is such that in doing so the xray beam travels through less lung tissue in terms of depth than either the contralateral side in the same rotated patient or the right lung in an unrotated patient. The beam travelling through less lung tissue is therefore less attenuated and the lung appears hyperlucent on the resultant film
  Poland syndrome
Poland syndrome is a rare cause of a hyperlucent hemithorax on a CXR. There is hypoplasia or even aplasia of the chest wall musculature plus/minus breast. Abnormalities of the fingers on the same side such as syndactyly (fusion) or brachydactyly (shortening) can also occur and the ipsilateral ribs may also be abnormal.
  Swyer-James syndrome
In this condition, normal development of the infant lung is impeded by bronchiolitis (viral or mycoplasma) at an early age, with superadded acute airspace destruction. Consequently the affected lobe is small and lucent on the CXR due to air trapping. It is a differential diagnosis for a unilateral lucent hemithorax, along with a pneumothorax, very large pulmonary emboli and causes of decreased chest wall musculature such as Poland syndrome or, historically, polio. In an an exam situation In an an exam situation Swyer-James syndrome is usually given as a teenage or young adult patient with a history of recurrent LRTIs. Air trapping, and bronchiectasis can also be described.
  Alpha 1 antitrypsin deficiency
Alpha-1 antitrypsin is a glycoprotein which is made in the liver and secreted. One of its functions in the lungs is to oppose the action of proteolytic enzymes the likes of which are secreted by white blood cells in order to counter sub-clinical bacterial infections. Since A1AT is deficient in these patients the unopposed action of the enzymes goes beyond the intended destruction of pathogenic bacteria and causes damage to the lung tissue. Patients are usually diagnosed in early adulthood when their symptoms develop. On CT there is panacinar emphysema, particularly affecting the bases. Bronchiectasis is also often seen. Cirrhosis is another feature of this disease and should be looked for on imaging. ",TRUE,I chose 4. Rotation to the right because it is the most common cause of an incidental hyperlucent right lung in an 18-year-old woman. This is due to the fact that the heart and lungs are in constant motion and the right lung is more likely to be displaced to the right due to the larger size of the left lung and the shape of the chest cavity.

13909,205045,A 70-year-old man develops worsening conductive hearing loss which does not improve following ear syringing. He undergoes a CT scan and this shows non-dependant soft tissue density within the left middle ear. In addition the malleus and incus cannot be identified. What is the most likely diagnosis? Select ONE answer only.,SBA: Central Nervous and Head & Neck,Pars tensa cholesteatoma,Pars flaccida cholesteatoma,Cholesterol granuloma,Otitis media,Aberrant internal carotid artery,A,49%,45%,3%,1%,1%,"Explanation:
Cholesteatoma
Cholesteatomas (Acquired or congenital) are histolologically epidermoid cysts. On imaging the finding of non-dependant soft tissue and bony erosion within the middle ear is typical for a cholesteatoma.
There are two types of acquired cholesteatoma:
Pars flaccida (80%) – classically erodes the scutum and extends superiorly
Pars tensa (20%) – classically erodes the ossicles, extending medially
These refer to the two parts of the tympanic membrane from which they arise. There is a lot of overlap between the appearances of these two types; both can and do erode the ossicles. Absence of ossicular erosion is by no means specific for a pars flaccida cholesteatoma.
Image © Medical Exam Prep
  In due course, if left unattended, a cholesteatoma will expand to fill the entire middle ear. Prior to this point they can be seen as non-dependant soft tissue within the middle ear. Dependant soft tissue within the middle ear suggests the presence of fluid or pus and the diagnosis of a middle ear infection. Once a cholesteatoma has filled the middle ear completely however no gas remains from which to discern dependency.
There are a number of theories as to how cholesteatomas arise. One theory is that following a perforation of the tympanic membrane entry of desquamated stratified keratinised squamous epithelium from the external auditory canal into the middle ear is permitted. There it adheres to the tympanic membrane and proliferates unrelentingly causing a soft tissue mass to form and eventually leading to bony erosion of the ossicles, scutum and/or other parts of the middle ear.
A congenital cholesteatoma behaves in a similar manner but is present from birth due to an aberrant location of a tiny island of keratinised squamous epithelium.
Cholesteatomas are difficult to manage as they have a high recurrence rate. Imaging has a significant role to play in the management of recurrent cholesteatomas; distinguishing recurrence from post-operative granulation tissue or fluid is important.
  Diagnosis Restricts Diffusion Enhances
Recurrent cholesteatoma Yes No
Granulation tissue No Yes
Fluid No No
  Post-contrast sequences for recurrent cholesteatomas require a delay of around 45 minutes from giving the contrast to acquiring images as the granulation tissue is slow to take up contrast. This has obvious down-sides to any modern day busy MRI schedule. However since the management of post-operative granulation tissue and post-operative fluid is largely identical, namely expectant, it is not important to differentiate the one from the other. Thus findings on diffusion weighted sequences are the most important thing in post-operative cholesteatoma imaging.
  Cholesterol granuloma
A cholesterol granuloma occurs as a sequela of recurrent bouts of otitis media. Haemorrhage within the middle ear leads to the formation of granulation tissue. On imaging this is seen as non-specification of the middle ear on CT. Bony changes can occur chronically with bony expansion, or displacement and even destruction of the ossicles. The signals characteristics on MRI are therefore important to distinguish it from a cholesteatoma. Whereas a cholesteatoma on MRI is isointense to brain parenchyma on T1, a cholesterol granuloma will show high signal in the middle ear on T1 due to the paramagnetic effects of methaemoglobin. On clinical examination the ENT surgeon may report a bulging blue tympanic membrane. This is classical. Dehiscence of the jugular bulb is an important differential diagnosis to exclude as this will also give a blue tympanic membrane on examination but the management is radically different!
  Aberrant internal carotid artery
An aberrant internal carotid artery can cause a pulsatile mass in the middle ear. The question usually asked on this topic is slightly different and to do with the persistent stapedial artery and consequential aplastic foramen spinosum (anatomically – ‘the heel of the high-heeled shoe’). The stapedial artery in such cases arises from the internal carotid artery and runs through the stapes, becoming the middle meningeal artery (which usually arises from the external carotid artery and courses through the foramen spinosum).",TRUE,"The CT scan findings of non-dependent soft tissue density within the left middle ear, and the inability to identify the malleus and incus, are consistent with a diagnosis of pars tensa cholesteatoma. Pars tensa cholesteatoma is a benign, slowly progressive, destructive lesion of the middle ear and mastoid that can cause conductive hearing loss. It is caused by the accumulation of keratin debris in the middle ear and may be associated with chronic otitis media.",2,,A,FALSE,"I chose option 1, Pars flaccida cholesteatoma, as the most likely diagnosis based on the patient's symptoms and the CT scan findings. 

A cholesteatoma is an abnormal growth of skin cells in the middle ear, which can lead to hearing loss and other complications. There are two types: Pars flaccida cholesteatoma and Pars tensa cholesteatoma. 

In this case, the patient has worsening conductive hearing loss, and the CT scan shows non-dependant soft tissue density within the left middle ear, along with the absence of the malleus and incus bones. These findings are consistent with a cholesteatoma, as it can cause erosion of the ossicles (malleus and incus) and accumulate as a soft tissue mass in the middle ear.

Pars flaccida cholesteatoma is more likely in this case because it typically involves the superior part of the middle ear and can lead to the erosion of the ossicles, as seen in the CT scan. Pars tensa cholesteatoma usually involves the inferior part of the middle ear and is less likely to cause ossicular erosion.

The other options are less likely because:

2. Cholesterol granuloma usually presents as a cystic lesion in the petrous apex, not as a soft tissue mass in the middle ear.
3. Otitis media typically presents with signs of infection, such as fever and ear pain, which are not mentioned in this case.
4. Aberrant internal carotid artery is a rare condition that would not cause the described CT scan findings and hearing loss.",B,TRUE,A
13808,205045,"A 65-year-old man undergoes a CT scan of his adrenal glands for an incidental lesion picked up on a CT colonogram. The lesion is situated in the lateral limb of the left adrenal gland and is 2cm in diameter. It measures 12HU on the unenhanced sequence, 38HU on the portal venous phase and 21HU on the delayed sequences. You may use a calculator. What is the absolute washout of this lesion?","SBA: Genito urinary, Adrenal, Obstetrics & Gynaecology and Breast",65%,45%,35%,68%,43%,A,77%,7%,6%,7%,4%,"Explanation:
Figures have been rounded to the nearest whole number.
Absolute washout = (38-21)/(38-12) = 65%
Relative washout = (38-21)/38 = 45%
    This lesion is a benign adrenal adenoma. In many centres, if the lesion measures less than 10HU on the unenhanced sequence then the study will be terminated at that point.
  Adrenal washout
Washout characteristics of adrenal nodules help confirm or refute a diagnosis of an adrenal adenoma. The absolute washout takes into account the initial uptake of contrast whereas the relative washout calculation is based only on how well contrast washes out of a nodule.
The underpinning principle is that vasculature within malignant lesions is more permeable than in benign lesions. This allows contrast to diffuse out of the lesion during the portal venous phase and the contrast is then slower to wash out during the delayed phase than it would be for benign lesions. Thus the higher/faster washout characteristics (either absolute or relative) the more suggestive it is that a lesion is benign.
    Adrenal adenoma
These present a diagnostic challenge if only to rule out a malignant adrenal mass. Once the diagnosis is confirmed they can then be left alone and do not require any further imaging. The majority are obvious on CT and obviously adenomas. Owing to their high fat content most adenomas show low Hounsfield units (HU) an HU <18 on an unenhanced study has a sensitivity of 85% and a specificity of 100%.
In cases where the fat content is insufficient to make the diagnosis an adrenal protocol CT can be performed. This compares the HU on an unenhanced scan, a portal venous phase scan and a 15 minute delayed phase scan. From these values the absolute washout can be calculated by comparing the difference between the two contrast studies with the amount of contrast taken up in the first place (i.e. the difference between the portal venous phase and the unenhanced phase). The relative washout is calculated by comparing the difference between the two contrast studies to just the portal venous phase (i.e. it is relative to the portal venous phase).
An alternative diagnostic strategy which, but for demand management, is better for patients as far as dose preservation is concerned, is an MRI scan. The fat content of adrenal adenomas shows up well as signal loss on out-of-phase imaging and gives a chemical shift artefact in the frequency encoding direction on both gradient echo and spin echo sequences.  On gradient echo sequences due to the chemical shift a black line appears in all directions and is termed the India Ink effect or etching artefact.
  Diagnostic of adrenal adenoma:
At least 60% absolute washout
At least 40% relative washout
<18 HU (100% specific)
<37 HU on a delayed scan
India ink effect on GE MRI
Chemical shift on GE and SE MRI",FALSE,"The absolute washout of this lesion is calculated by subtracting the attenuation of the delayed phase from the attenuation of the unenhanced phase, and then dividing that result by the attenuation of the unenhanced phase. In this case, 12-21=-9, and then -9/12=-0.75. This is equivalent to 35%.",1,"3. A question about the application of knowledge, how to interpret a scan?

This question falls under category 3: A question about the application of knowledge, how to interpret a scan.",C,TRUE,"I chose option 1 (65%) because it is the closest value to the calculated absolute washout percentage for the adrenal lesion. The absolute washout percentage is a useful parameter in differentiating between benign and malignant adrenal lesions. It is calculated using the Hounsfield Units (HU) from the unenhanced, enhanced (portal venous phase), and delayed sequences of a CT scan.

In this case, the formula for absolute washout is:

Absolute washout = [(Enhanced HU - Delayed HU) / (Enhanced HU - Unenhanced HU)] x 100

By plugging in the given values from the question (12HU unenhanced, 38HU enhanced, and 21HU delayed), the calculated absolute washout percentage is approximately 65.38%.

Select ONE answer only.,SBA: Gastrointestinal,Repeat interval AXR,Colonoscopy,Barium enema,Bowel resection,CT colonoscopy,A,59%,4%,2%,21%,14%,"Explanation:
Toxic megacolon
This term, often ascribed loosely, is actually only attributable to cases where there is acute transmural colitis. Loss of motor tone leads to colonic dilatation to more than 5.5cm and widespread mucosal sloughing occurs. Consequentially there is loss of the normal mucosal pattern and haustration; this would usually be appreciated best on a barium study however can also be demonstrated on an abdominal radiograph or CT scan. A barium enema, or any other colorectal instrumentation, would be contra-indicated. The patient usually has severe bloody diarrhoea and is at significant risk of perforation. The condition carries a 20% mortality rate. The management varies according to aetiology. Surgical exploration should be used only if absolutely necessary for patients with inflammatory bowel disease; these patients are likely to require multiple abdominal surgeries throughout their life. Steroids, immunosuppressives and biologics should be used where possible.
Ulcerative colitis is the most common cause of toxic megacolon.
  Differential diagnoses of megacolon © Medical Exam Prep
  Distinguishing a toxic megacolon from a non-toxic megacolon is important as the management changes dramatically. Loss of haustration with thumbprinting and/or a known history of inflammatory bowel disease, or vasculopathy, or a positive stool culture are strong indicators that this may be a toxic megacolon.
Ulcerative colitis
Whereas Crohn's disease causes discontinuous transmural inflammation in ulcerative colitis it is a continuous segment of bowel which is affected beginning at the rectum and progressing proximally. Additionally, it is only the mucosa and submucosa which are affected. Patients present with symptoms of abdominal pain, bloody diarrhoea and experience relapses and periods of remission with the disease. In general, the small bowel is spared with the exception of the terminal ileum which can be affected in a so-called ‘backwash ileitis’ manner. On imaging colonic mucosal hyperenhancement can sometimes be seen, along with mucosal oedema (so-called thumbprinting). On fluoroscopic studies pseudopolyps can be seen – these are actually islands of normal mucosa or granulation tissue surrounded on all sides by inflammation. In the chronic phase the colon may become narrower, smooth and featureless as the haustral markings are lost. This is described as a lead-pipe appearance.",FALSE,"Colonoscopy is the best next step in the management of this patient because it will allow the physician to directly visualize the inside of the patient's colon and identify the cause of the symptoms.

Teacup calcifications are caused by liquid milk of calcium within fibrocystic change. On mammography they appear as small curvilinear thin calcifications resembling the fluid level in a teacup on lateral views and rounded on a craniocaudal view, like a teacup viewed from above. Although teacup calcifications are typically benign in nature and suggestive of only fibrocystic changes they must be distinguished from suspicious calcifications. Thus the best views for confirming the presence of teacup calcifications would be a true lateral, as opposed to an oblique lateral, and a CC view.

When she arrives he is clearly unwell; feverish and complaining of right upper quadrant pain. While she is visiting he experiences a rigor. She sends him to A&E where he undergoes an abdominal x-ray. This shows gas bubbles in the right hypochondrium. An ultrasound shows intrarenal and perirenal hyperechoic stranding. What is the most likely diagnosis?,"SBA: Genito urinary, Adrenal, Obstetrics & Gynaecology and Breast",Emphysematous pyelonephritis,Xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis,Tuberculosis,Malakoplakia,Leukoplakia,A,95%,4%,1%,0%,0%,"Explanation:
Emphysematous Pyelonephritis
The radiological appearances of this condition are very striking, particularly on CT where streaky or lobulated gas can be seen in the renal parenchyma and perirenal tissues. On ultrasound the gas causes ring-down artefacts and is sometime described as giving a ‘dirty shadowing’ appearance. It is a very important diagnosis to make since it comes with significant morbidity. E-coli is the usual culprit and a history of poorly controlled diabetes is usual. The main differential diagnoses is the far less severe condition of emphysematous pyelitis where e-coli infection is confined to the excretory system and responds well to antibiotic therapy, and the presence of a fistulous connection to the bowel.
  Malakoplakia
Directly translated from Greek, malakoplakia just means soft plaques. These are actually submucosal inflammatory plaques consisting of basophilic PAS positive inclusion bodies and incompletely destroyed e-coli bacteria. The giveaway pathological term is Michaelis-Gutmann inclusion bodies which are the incompletely destroyed e-coli bacteria surrounded by a lipoprotein membrane. Although malakoplakia can occur in anyone, patients with diabetes mellitus or immunosuppression are predisposed to it. Importantly though, it is not a pre-malignant condition unlike leukoplakia. On imaging there are filling defects in the bladder and distal ureters. These are usually small, measuring only a few millimetres across.
  Xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis (XGP)
This curious condition results from chronic pyelonephritis and leads to a non-functioning kidney. Chronic infection (most commonly with Proteus or e-coli) induces a granulomatous process whereby the renal tissue eventually becomes replaced by a mass of reactive tissue. Since proteus infection is one of the main causes it is not surprising that many cases present with a staghorn calculus. The exact association varies from 30-90% depending on the data source. The other finding on CT is of multiple low attenuation rounded areas with Hounsfield Units (HU) of around -15 to -20. These are the dilated calyces filled with debris and xanthoma collections and they cause the whole kidney to be enlarged. The appearance is said to resemble a bear’s paw. Patients can present either on a background of recurrent UTIs or potentially renal colic. Vague malaise and weight loss may be the presentation in the absence of direct urinary symptoms.
  Renal tuberculosis
In areas of the world endemic to tuberculosis, renal tuberculosis is a reasonably common presentation of extra-pulmonary disease. The appearances on imaging vary depending on the disease timeline. The classical ‘putty kidney’ of renal tuberculosis is an end-stage appearance where there is dystrophic calcification affecting all parts of the kidney. At this point the kidney has usually become shrunken and small and the final appearance is of so-called autonephrectomy when there is essentially no parenchymal tissue left, just amorphous calcification. An earlier manifestation is stenosis to the infundibuli connecting the calyces to the renal pelvis causing proximal dilatation of the calyces which are seen to be clubbed on a urogram. Purportedly, the earliest sign is of moth-eaten calyces owing to uneven erosion to the papillae.
  Leukoplakia 
Directly translated from Greek, leukoplakia just means white plaques. It is a squamous metaplastic condition affecting the transitional cell epithelium of the bladder. Presentation is usually as a consequence either of recurrent urinary tract infections or urinary tract calculi. Sometimes patients complain of passing flaky white tissue in the urine which is pathognomonic for this condition. On imaging there is mucosal thickening and filling defects within the bladder. Some sources consider leukoplakia to be a premalignant condition for epidermoid carcinoma.",FALSE,"Xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis is the most likely diagnosis because it is the most common cause of gas bubbles in the right hypochondrium and intrarenal and perirenal hyperechoic stranding. This condition is typically seen in elderly patients, especially those with poorly controlled diabetes, and is characterized by fever, abdominal pain, and rigors.",2,,B,TRUE,"I chose Emphysematous pyelonephritis as the most likely diagnosis because the given clinical presentation and imaging findings are consistent with this condition. 

Emphysematous pyelonephritis (EPN) is a severe, necrotizing infection of the renal parenchyma and surrounding tissues, characterized by the presence of gas within the renal parenchyma, collecting system, or perirenal space. It is more commonly seen in patients with poorly controlled diabetes, like the 86-year-old gentleman in the scenario.

The clinical presentation of fever, right upper quadrant pain, and rigor suggests an acute infection. The abdominal x-ray showing gas bubbles in the right hypochondrium and the ultrasound findings of intrarenal and perirenal hyperechoic stranding further support the diagnosis of EPN. These imaging findings are indicative of gas formation within the kidney and surrounding tissues, which is a characteristic feature of EPN.

The other options, such as Xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis, Tuberculosis, Malakoplakia, and Leukoplakia, may present with similar symptoms, but the presence of gas in the renal region is more specific to Emphysematous pyelonephritis.",A,TRUE,A

14512,205045,A 54-year-old man collapses while playing golf. On arrival at the Emergency Department the blood pressure in his arms is found to be different. He is thought to have suffered a stroke and undergoes carotid Doppler study. The sonographer believes he may have subclavian steal syndrome. Which of the following is NOT a possible cause of subclavian steal syndrome? Select ONE answer only.,SBA: Central Nervous and Head & Neck,Poland syndrome,Atherosclerosis,Takayasu aortitis,Thoracic aortic dissection,Cervical rib,A,87%,2%,3%,5%,4%,"Explanation:
Please note that the question asks which answer is NOT a possible cause.
  Subclavian steal syndrome occurs when blood supplying the arm (usually the left arm) travels via the ipsilateral vertebral artery in order to bypass a proximal obstruction of the subclavian artery. The distal subclavian artery ‘steals’ blood from the vertebral artery circulation. This gives rise to two different categories of symptoms:
Arm - weaker pulses, numbness, paraesthesia, fingertip necrosis
Brain - syncope, ischaemic symptoms
  The most likely cause of subclavian steal would be atherosclerosis. Takayasu aortitis and aortic dissections can also cause subclavian steal but would not be at the top of a differential list without further prompts from the history. A cervical rib can also cause subclavian steal syndrome via stenosis, intimal damage and consequent thrombosis.
  Poland syndrome
This is a congenital condition where there is hypoplasia or aplasia of the pectoralis major muscle on one side in association with abnormalities in the ipsilateral hand such as syndactyly, and hypoplasia of the middle phalanx. The absence of the large pectoralis major muscle is seen on a chest radiograph as abnormal hyperlucency on the affected side.",FALSE,"I chose 3 because Takayasu aortitis is not a possible cause of subclavian steal syndrome. Subclavian steal syndrome is a condition caused by a narrowing or obstruction of the subclavian artery, which can lead to a decrease in blood flow to the brain. It can be caused by atherosclerosis, Poland syndrome, thoracic aortic dissection, or a cervical rib. Takayasu aortitis is an inflammatory condition of the aorta and its branches, but is not thought to cause subclavian steal syndrome.",1,"3. A question about the interpretation of results, what do the results mean?

Option 3. A question about the interpretation of results, what do the results mean?",C,TRUE,"I chose option 4 (Poland syndrome) because it is not a possible cause of subclavian steal syndrome. Poland syndrome is a congenital condition characterized by the absence or underdevelopment of chest wall muscles and sometimes webbing of the fingers on one side of the body. It does not involve the blood vessels and therefore does not cause subclavian steal syndrome, which is a condition where blood flow is reversed in the vertebral artery due to a blockage in the subclavian artery. The other options (atherosclerosis, Takayasu aortitis, thoracic aortic dissection, and cervical rib) are all potential causes of subclavian steal syndrome as they can lead to blockage or narrowing of the subclavian artery.",A,FALSE,D
14455,205045,Which SINGLE statement regarding the epididymis is true?,"SBA: Genito urinary, Adrenal, Obstetrics & Gynaecology and Breast",It is innervated by the testicular plexus,It consists of four main regions,The tail is the most proximal part,It is responsible for the production of sperm,It receives its arterial supply from the epididymal artery,A,40%,6%,10%,5%,39%,"Explanation:
The epididymis is a tube that connects the testis to the vas deferens. It is responsible for the transport and storage of sperm cells produced in the testes.
The epididymis can be divided into three main regions:
The head, which is the most proximal portion and is formed by the efferent tubules of the testes, which transport sperm from the testes to the epididymis
The body, which is the middle portion and is formed by the heavily coiled duct of the epididymis
The tail, which is the most distal portion and marks the origin of the vas deferens, which transports sperm to the urethra for ejaculation
  The epididymis receives its innervation from the spermatic plexus (also referred to as the testicular plexus), a network of nerves derived from the renal plexus that receives branches from the aortic plexus.
The epididymis shares a common blood supply with the testis. They receive their arterial supply from the paired testicular arteries, which are direct branches from the abdominal aorta. They descend into the abdomen and pass into the scrotum via the inguinal canal, contained within the spermatic cord.
  The testis and epididymis (from Gray’s Anatomy)
 ",FALSE,"I chose this answer because it is the only one that is true. The epididymis is a long, coiled tube located at the back of the testicles that is responsible for the production and storage of sperm. It is also responsible for the transport of sperm from the testes to the vas deferens.",1,"1. Basic factual recall, either of basic science, physics, anatomy or regarding a procedure.",A,TRUE,"I chose option 3 because it is the correct statement regarding the epididymis. The epididymis is indeed innervated by the testicular plexus, which is a network of nerves derived from the renal, aortic, and lumbar plexuses. This innervation provides sensory and autonomic supply to the epididymis, playing a role in its function.

The other options are incorrect for the following reasons:
1. The epididymis consists of three main regions: the head, body, and tail.
2. The tail is the most distal part, not the most proximal part.
4. The epididymis is not responsible for the production of sperm; it is responsible for the storage and maturation of sperm. Sperm production occurs in the seminiferous tubules within the testes.
5. The arterial supply to the epididymis comes from the testicular artery, not the epididymal artery.",A,FALSE,E
14134,205045,A 72-year-old man is undergoing pre-operative assessment prior to a routine TURP procedure for some troublesome lower urinary tract symptoms. When his PSA is found to be markedly elevated he undergoes an MRI scan for further investigation.  Which of the following regarding prostate cancer in the transitional zone is correct? Select ONE answer only.,"SBA: Genito urinary, Adrenal, Obstetrics & Gynaecology and Breast",Around 30% of prostate cancers occur in the transitional zone,They can be easily distinguished from BPH changes,They often have extraprostatic disease at presentation,A negative trans-rectal biopsy is reassuring,A non-circumscribed low T2 lesion is most likely to be BPH,A,83%,2%,7%,3%,5%,"Explanation:
Transitional zone cancers are less common than peripheral zone cancers but do occur and account for around 30% of prostate cancers. They are often harder to detect clinically due to their central location, and can be occult on imaging owing to overlap and confusion, in particular in patients with benign prostatic hypertrophy since it is the transitional zone which is involved in BPH. BPH leads to a heterogenous and enlarged appearance to the transitional zone which can obscure smaller lesions. On the plus side however, they are more often organ-confined since their central location effectively cushions them from capsular breach for longer. Their central location within the prostate cancer does however mean that trans-rectal biopsies may be falsely reassuring if negative, having missed the lesion due to lesion-depth within the prostate. Clinicians should have a low threshold for repeat-biopsies.
Peripheral zone
The highest grade of suspicion for malignancy in the peripheral zone is indicated by the presence of marked restricted diffusion (focal high b-value and corresponding low ADC signal), with a PIRADS 5 lesion being one that is greater than 1.5 cm. PIRADS 3 lesions will show some restricted diffusion but this is far less (subjective analysis) than for PIRADS 4 lesions. Dynamic contrast enhancement is used for assessment of peripheral zone lesions only - differentiating between lesions which show only limited restricted diffusion. If there is dynamic contrast enhancement with a type 3 washout curve, the lesion becomes a PIRADS 4 lesion despite the only limited restriction in diffusion.
Transitional zone
The highest grade of suspicion for transitional zone lesions is reserved for moderate T2 lesion which is lenticular or non-circumscribed and moderately T2 hypointense (PIRADS 5 >1.5 cm).
Three plane T2 imaging is common practice and enables full assessment of the peripheral zone of the prostate, particularly examining for extra-capsular extension, bladder base or seminal vesical invasion. T2 is also the most important sequence for lesions in the transitional zone.
The T1 weighted sequences are also useful to check for the presence of any haemorrhagic foci although since most patients now undergo their MRI scan prior to any biopsies being taken this has become far less important.
Interestingly the ADC map is more sensitive for carcinoma of the prostate (in the peripheral zone) than the DWI sequences. A finding of focal low signal on the ADC map may be seen in the absence of a corresponding high DWI focus. In the transitional zone however, the T2 sequences are more sensitive.",FALSE,"I chose this answer because a negative trans-rectal biopsy is often used to rule out prostate cancer in the transitional zone. A trans-rectal biopsy is a procedure in which a sample of tissue is taken from the prostate and examined for cancerous cells. If no cancerous cells are present, then this is reassuring that the patient does not have prostate cancer in the transitional zone.",1,"3.

Second branchial cleft cysts are the most common type of branchial cleft anomalies, and they typically present as a painless, compressible, and well-circumscribed mass along the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. The ultrasound findings of a well-circumscribed, compressible mass with internal structure but no internal flow further support this diagnosis, as second branchial cleft cysts are typically fluid-filled and do not have significant blood flow within them.

Dumbell protrusion is NOT a known association for which of the following?,SBA: Musculoskeletal and Trauma,Epidermoid,Neurofibroma,Meningioma,Schwannoma,Ganglioneuroma,A,33%,4%,50%,6%,6%,"Explanation:
Dumbell lesions of the spinal cord are those which extend from the canal to the paravertebral space via the exit foramina and are a classic finding for the following intradural tumours:
Schwannoma
Neurofibroma
Ganglioneuroma
Neuroblastoma

By process of elimination therefore the answer for this question must be an Epidermoid since large lesions of the other potential answers are all likely to show dumbbell protrusion through the neural foramina. Meningiomas in the spine do not cause bony hyperostosis like they might in the brain, neither do they cause bony remodelling.

   ",TRUE,"Epidermoid is a type of tumor that is characterized by the presence of squamous epithelial cells and keratin-filled cysts. It is not associated with dumbbell protrusion, which is a type of spinal cord compression caused by a tumor or other mass lesion that protrudes through the spinal canal and into the intervertebral foramen. This type of compression is most commonly seen with meningiomas, schwannomas, neurofibromas, and ganglioneuromas, but not epidermoids.",1,"3.

The carpal tunnel contains a total of nine flexor tendons (but not the muscles themselves), surrounded by a synovial sheath, and the median nerve. The tendons contained within the carpal tunnel are:
Flexor digitorum profundus (four tendons)
Flexor digitorum superficialis (four tendons)
Flexor pollicis longus (one tendon)
  The eight tendons of the flexor digitorum profundus and superficialis are surrounded by a single synovial sheath, whereas the tendon of flexor pollicis longus is surrounded by its own synovial sheath. These sheaths allow free movement of the tendons.
The tendon of flexor carpi radialis does not pass through the carpal tunnel, but is instead located within the flexor retinaculum itself.",TRUE,I chose this answer because the flexor pollicis longus is one of the tendons that passes through the carpal tunnel. The flexor pollicis longus is a muscle that runs from the forearm to the thumb and is responsible for bending the thumb at the interphalangeal joint.

Ductus diverticulum
At the site of the ligamentum arteriosus some patients develop a small diverticulum which can be mistaken for aneurysmal dilatation. A smoothly tapering, obtuse angled, widening at the classical location for this can confidently be ascribed to a ductus diverticulum and no further management is necessary.",FALSE,"I chose this option because the CT scan revealed a smooth bulge to the inner aortic wall opposite the origin of the left subclavian artery. This could be a sign of an aortic dissection, which is a life-threatening condition and requires urgent treatment. Endovascular stenting is the most appropriate management for this condition as it can be done quickly and safely, and can provide immediate relief of symptoms.",2,"3. A question about clinical management, what is the most appropriate treatment?

3. A question about clinical management, what is the most appropriate treatment?",C,FALSE,"I chose option 2, ""Urgent vascular referral for endovascular stenting,"" because the patient's CT scan shows a smooth bulge in the inner aortic wall opposite the origin of the left subclavian artery. This finding is suggestive of an aortic injury, specifically an aortic dissection or pseudoaneurysm, which can be a life-threatening condition if not treated promptly. 

Endovascular stenting is a minimally invasive procedure that can be used to repair the damaged aortic wall and prevent further complications. An urgent vascular referral is appropriate in this case to ensure the patient receives timely and specialized care from a vascular surgeon.

The other options are not appropriate given the potential severity of the injury:

1. Urgent cardiothoracic referral for open stenting: Open stenting is a more invasive surgical option, and in this case, endovascular stenting would be preferred as it is less invasive and has a quicker recovery time.

The patient has just returned from a month abroad. His parents become increasingly concerned that their son has changed. He is no longer interested in visiting his friends and sits for hours at home doing nothing. They have also noticed a tremor to his hands and some slurring of his speech. His x-ray shows generalised osteoporotic changes and a few small subarticular cysts. The triangular fibrocartilage complex appears to contain some calcification. What is the most likely diagnosis?,SBA: Paediatrics,Wilson disease,Haemochromatosis,Calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease,Enteropathic arthropathy,Alkaptonuria,A,65%,9%,12%,4%,10%,"Explanation:
Wilson disease
Inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion, this disease results from an excess of copper within the body due to the inability of the liver to excrete it. It can present in childhood with cirrhosis but later presentations are more likely to be due to the neuropsychiatric manifestations. Clinically adolescent or adult patients develop tremor and dysarthria due to copper deposition in the lentiform nucleus. The classic diagnostic feature is Kayser-Fleischer pigment rings in the eyes. Radiologically the following features can be seen:
Hepatic manifestations: The liver appears normal on MRI since fatty infiltration effectively cancels out the paramagnetic effects of copper
Musculoskeletal manifestations: Generalised osteoporosis, subarticular cysts, chondrocalcinosis and arthropathy which can mimic CPPD
CNS manifestations: White matter atrophy and T2 hyperintensities predominantly affecting the basal ganglia and thalami. T1 signal is also high in these areas, differentiating it from many of the other basal ganglia disorders. There is a classical feature of ‘sparing of the red nucleus’ leading to an appearance known as the giant panda sign at the level of the pons.
  Alkaptonuria also known as ochronosis
This condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. It is caused by excessive circulating levels of homogentisic acid (HGA) when the enzyme which would usually degrade it is deficient. HGA has an affinity for collagen and accumulates in the connective tissues throughout the body. In visible light HGA has a blackish colour and thus the disease can be diagnosed in infancy when a baby’s nappies are stained black by the presence of HGA in the urine. By the time patients reach their 20s pigmentation may be visible in their skin, particularly the ears. This is initially a dark yellow colour (hence the term ochronosis, from ‘Ochre’ in Greek meaning a dark yellow colour) but can progress to blue-grey and black.
  In imaging chondrocalcinosis is the most prominent feature, with calcification and destruction of the intervertebral discs. Premature osteoarthritic changes to the hands, feet, shoulders, hips and knees will also develop as the collagen deteriorates. Deposition in the heart and kidneys too leads to cardiac and renal failure.
  Haemochromatosis
The primary version of this disease can be inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion. Excess dietary iron is absorbed and this accumulates in all tissues of the body leading to various different problems.
Secondary haemochromatosis can arise if patients receive numerous blood transfusions without sufficient chelation to mitigate against the iron overload.
Cirrhosis – the presence of the excess iron in the liver leads to unusual signal properties on an MRI scan. Iron is paramagnetic and causes spin dephasing. T2* and T2 sequences are particularly vulnerable to this effect but lower than expected signal will be seen on all sequences. Importantly the signal from the spleen and bone marrow should be normal. By contrast they will be involved in cases of transfusional siderosis.
Generalised osteoporosis
Hook like osteophytes on the radial aspect of the metacarpal heads – these are highly characteristic
Chondrocalcinosis, particularly affecting the knees
Insulin dependent diabetes
Congestive cardiomyopathy
Skin pigmentation
  Calcium pyrophosphate dehydrate disease (CPPD) also known as pseudogout
CPPD can present in an acute or subacute fashion but is also seen as a chronic cause of joint inflammation. It may be misdiagnosed as simple osteoarthritis owing to its often bilateral and symmetrical distribution but there are also a couple of areas of the body which can be affected in particular, and which would be unusual for isolated degenerative changes.
The patellofemoral joint – joint space loss here can be extremely striking with almost complete preservation of the joint space at the medial and lateral compartments of the knee
Triangular fibrocartilaginous complex of the wrist – calcification
Radiocarpal joints – degenerative changes without involvement of the DIPs and PIPs
  Enteropathic arthropathy
Sacroiliitis and spondylitis are the hallmarks of enteropathic arthropathy. It is an important seronegative spondyloarthropathy. Outside of the axial skeleton, other features common to all seronegative spondyloarthropathies are also found. These include arthritis in the hands and feet, uveitis, and enthesitis (especially calcaneal). Interestingly although it is most commonly discussed in relation to Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis, only 5 and 10% respectively of patients with these conditions will develop enteropathic arthropathy. By contrast of patients with Whipple disease, around 75-90% of them will suffer from enteropathic arthropathy. Infection with Salmonella, Shigella and Yersinia are also known associations.",FALSE,"Calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease (CPPD) is the most likely diagnosis in this case. CPPD is a type of crystal deposition arthritis that is associated with osteoporotic changes and subarticular cysts. It is also associated with triangular fibrocartilage complex calcification, which is what was seen on the x-ray. CPPD is also more common in patients who have recently returned from a long trip abroad, which is the case with this patient.",2,,C,TRUE,"I chose option 4, Wilson disease, because the symptoms and findings described in the scenario are consistent with this condition. Wilson disease is a rare genetic disorder that causes copper to accumulate in the liver, brain, and other vital organs. The symptoms mentioned, such as a change in behavior, tremor in hands, and slurring of speech, can be attributed to the neurological effects of copper accumulation in the brain. 

Additionally, the x-ray findings of generalized osteoporotic changes and subarticular cysts can be associated with Wilson disease, as it can lead to bone demineralization and joint abnormalities. The calcification of the triangular fibrocartilage complex further supports this diagnosis.

The other options do not fit as well with the presented symptoms and findings:
1. Haemochromatosis involves iron accumulation, not copper, and primarily affects the liver, heart, and pancreas.
2. Calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease mainly affects joints and presents with acute inflammatory arthritis.
3. Enteropathic arthropathy is related to inflammatory bowel disease and primarily affects the peripheral joints and spine.

Morton neuroma
Fibrosis surrounding a plantar digital nerve leads to a hard lump developing in the sole of the foot. Patients complain of a painful lump which feels a bit like walking on a hot lump of gravel. On an MRI scan they are often slightly disguised by their low or isointensity to muscle on T1 weighted sequences and hypointensity on T2 weighted sequences. Curiously for a fibrotic process, they do usually enhance with gadolinium. On ultrasound the classic appearance of a hypoechoic mass situated between but slightly proximal to the metatarsal heads should be sufficient to make the diagnosis. Most are found in the third metatarsal space. The Mulder sign can be performed clinically or with ultrasound and involves eliciting pain and a clicking sound when the metatarsal heads are squeezed together while applying pressure on the dorsum of the foot over the neuroma, or scanning the sole of the foot.
It is said that Morton neuromas are larger and easier to visualise with MRI when the patient is prone, i.e. the foot is slightly plantar-flexed. On ultrasound this translates to a straightforward prone position or one where the patient is sitting on the side of the couch with their feet slightly plantar flexed. One theory is that any physical tension through the metatarsal joints (more likely on supine positioning) causes the neuroma to be pulled up in-between the metatarsal heads.",TRUE,"Sitting with feet slightly plantar flexed is the best position for assessing whether the patient has a Morton neuroma. This position allows the clinician to palpate the area between the metatarsal heads, which is where the neuroma is typically located. This position also allows for maximum compression of the area, which can help to confirm the diagnosis.",3,"3. A question about practical application, how to correctly perform a procedure.

This question falls under category 3: A question about practical application, how to correctly perform a procedure.",E,FALSE,"I chose option 1, passive dorsiflexion, because it is the best position for assessing whether the patient has a Morton neuroma. In this position, the patient's foot is dorsiflexed (toes pulled up towards the shin) by the examiner, which helps to widen the intermetatarsal spaces and stretch the interdigital nerves. This allows the ultrasound to better visualize any potential neuromas or abnormal tissue between the metatarsal bones. Passive dorsiflexion provides optimal visualization of the neuroma, making it easier to identify and diagnose.",B,FALSE,B
10591,205045,A 76-year-old lady with biopsy proven rectal adenocarcinoma undergoes an MRI scan for local staging. She has T3N1M0 disease and surgery is being planned. Her case is discussed at the local MDT and the colorectal surgeon is enquiring about the risk of recurrence. The additional presence of which of the following is responsible for an increase in the risk of recurrence in this patient?,SBA: Gastrointestinal,A low tumour,Nodal disease within the circumferential resection margin,A circumferential resection margin of 3mm,Involvement of the mesorectal fat,Involvement of the muscularis propria,A,30%,18%,8%,38%,6%,"Explanation:
Involvement of the muscularis propria is simply indicative of the tumour being a T3 tumour. Involvement of the mesorectal fat is to be expected in T3 disease. Nodal disease within the CRM is resectable and a CRM of 3mm confers no greater risk.
Low tumours have a higher risk of recurrence since there is less fat within the mesorectal fascia and the CRM is more likely to be involved at an earlier point in time.
  Rectal cancer MRI
The muscularis propria is the outer wall of the rectum and shows up as low signal on T2 weighted sequences.
Since the rectum (like the oesophagus) does not have a serosa, once spread beyond the muscularis propria into the mesorectal fat has occurred (i.e. a T3 tumour), nodal involvement is also feasible. The mesorectal fascia is a thin plane of connective tissue which contains fat, the rectum, local lymph nodes as a distinct anatomical entity and is of paramount importance in rectal cancer management. Spread beyond the mesorectal fascia denotes a T4 tumour. MRI is excellent for local staging of rectal cancer because the mesorectal fascia is seen clearly as a thin black line on T2 weighted sequences and its involvement or lack thereof can be readily discerned. In contrast, the tumour appears as intermediate signal on T2, distorting the normal anatomy. The fascia is also referred to as the ‘CRM’ which stands for circumferential resection margin and relates to the surgical operation performed for rectal tumours, namely a total mesorectal excision (TME). The proximity of the tumour extent to the CRM is prognostically important; tumours with a >1mm margin before they reach the CRM are far less likely to recur. A <1mm margin is taken as involvement of the CRM.
A distinction is also drawn between lower and upper rectal tumours (as defined by distance from the anorectal angle). Inferiorly there is far less fat contained within the mesorectal fascia and consequently tumour can involve the CRM earlier on.
  Rectal cancer staging
The following table heavily paraphrases the TNM stages for rectal cancer. There are multiple subdivisions which are not covered here either. The focus for this table is radiologically distinct entities as well as the points at which the management alters.
  Stage

 ",FALSE,Involvement of the mesorectal fat is responsible for an increase in the risk of recurrence in this patient because it is an indication that the tumor has spread beyond the rectal wall and into the surrounding lymph nodes. This increases the risk of the tumor spreading to other parts of the body and makes it more difficult to completely remove the tumor during surgery.,3,"3. A question about management, what is the most appropriate treatment?

This question falls under 3. A question about management, what is the most appropriate treatment?",A,FALSE,"I chose option 2, ""Nodal disease within the circumferential resection margin,"" because it indicates that the cancer has spread to the lymph nodes within the area where the surgeon will attempt to remove the tumor. The presence of nodal disease within the circumferential resection margin suggests that there is a higher likelihood of residual cancer cells remaining after surgery, which increases the risk of recurrence.

9811,205045,"73-year-old man who has been awaiting an operation for over a year finally undergoes an elective total hip replacement for degenerative joint disease. Despite receiving the appropriate precautions, a peri-prosthetic infection is suspected when he presents 4 months later. He complains that his pain never fully resolved following the operation and is now becoming yet worse. What would be the best way to establish the diagnosis?",SBA: Musculoskeletal and Trauma,111In – WBC nuclear medicine test,Plain films alone will be sufficient,99m-Tc – MDP nuclear medicine test,MRI with dedicated post-op hip coil,CT with a high kV setting,A,67%,5%,12%,14%,2%,"Explanation:
One of the first widespread uses of laminar flow operating theatres was for joint replacement operations as the potential consequences of an infected prosthesis are significant. An infection acquired at the time of surgery may not manifest for some months afterwards. Sometimes there are indicators of an infection on plain film such as lucent areas or periostitis however in the case of an indolent infection 111In – WBC scanning is the most specific test available. It can also be combined with a 99mTc – Sulphur Colloid scan to improve accuracy. Where the activity of both tracers is matched the scan is normal but where there are hot areas on the WBC scan without corresponding sulphur colloid activity an infection can be diagnosed.",FALSE,"I chose number 4 because MRI with a dedicated post-op hip coil is the most effective way to diagnose a peri-prosthetic infection. It can provide detailed images of the prosthesis, soft tissue, and bone, allowing for the visualization of any abnormalities. It is also more sensitive than other imaging modalities, such as plain film or CT, and can detect even subtle changes that may indicate infection.",2,,D,TRUE,"I chose option 2, the 111In – WBC (Indium-111 White Blood Cell) nuclear medicine test, because it is a sensitive and specific imaging modality for detecting peri-prosthetic infections. In this scenario, the patient presents with symptoms suggestive of an infection following a total hip replacement surgery. The 111In – WBC scan involves labeling the patient's white blood cells with a radioactive tracer, which then accumulates at the site of infection. This allows for accurate localization and identification of an infection, which is crucial for appropriate management and treatment.

Options 1, 3, 4, and 5 are less appropriate for diagnosing a peri-prosthetic infection in this case:

1. Plain films alone may show some signs of infection, such as periosteal reaction or bone destruction, but they are not sensitive or specific enough to establish the diagnosis of a peri-prosthetic infection.

3. 99m-Tc – MDP (Technetium-99m Methylene Diphosphonate) nuclear medicine test is a bone scan that can show increased bone turnover, but it is not specific for infection and can also be positive in cases of aseptic loosening, inflammation, and other conditions.

4. MRI with a dedicated post-op hip coil can be useful for evaluating soft tissue and bone marrow abnormalities, but it may be less accurate in detecting peri-prosthetic infections due to the presence of metal artifacts from the hip prosthesis.

5. CT with a high kV setting can provide detailed images of the bone and surrounding structures, but it is less sensitive and specific for diagnosing peri-prosthetic infections compared to nuclear medicine tests like the 111In – WBC scan.",A,FALSE,B
9291,205045,A 45-year-old man has a CT scan of his pelvis following a motorbiking accident. There are no findings of major trauma but there is a 1.5cm well-rounded mass close to the tail of the pancreas. It is isodense to the spleen. The patient goes on to have a 99mTc – sulphur colloid scan on which the mass shows good uptake. What is the most likely diagnosis?,SBA: Gastrointestinal,Accessory spleen,Lymph node,Pancreatic pseudocyst,False splenic cyst,Exophytic renal angiomyolipoma,A,97%,1%,1%,1%,0%,"Explanation:
Splenic variants
Rarely (<1% of patients) the spleen can migrate from its usual position and end up virtually anywhere else within the abdominal cavity. This is of no clinical consequence unless the consequently long and tortuous vessels supplying it become compromised by torsion or the patient undergoes abdominal surgery. On imaging the wandered spleen should exhibit the usual characteristics of a normally positioned spleen but if there is any doubt as to the diagnosis confirmation with a 99mTc-sulphur-colloid scan can be sought.
Accessory spleens or splenunculi are relatively common (30% of patients) and can usually be found close to the splenic hilum or tail of the pancreas. They follow the spleen on all modalities and should not be mistaken for intra-abdominal lymph nodes.
Polysplenia is a condition which arises as part of left-sided isomerism (also known as heterotaxy). In Left-sided isomerism all of the features which would usually be found on the left side of the body are found on both, or right sided features are found on the left side (such as the liver). Vice versa is true for right-sided isomerism. Right-sided isomerism usually presents earlier on due to the greater complexity of associated cardiac abnormalities.

   ",FALSE,"I chose this option because the CT scan showed a well-rounded mass close to the tail of the pancreas that was isodense to the spleen. The 99mTc – sulphur colloid scan showed good uptake, suggesting that the mass is likely a cyst. False splenic cysts are often found near the tail of the pancreas and can show good uptake on a 99mTc – sulphur colloid scan.",2,,D,TRUE,"I chose option 5, ""Accessory spleen,"" because the given information in the question supports this diagnosis. The mass is described as well-rounded, isodense to the spleen, and shows good uptake on a 99mTc-sulphur colloid scan. These characteristics are typical of an accessory spleen, which is a benign congenital anomaly where there is ectopic splenic tissue. Accessory spleens are often found near the tail of the pancreas and can mimic other types of masses. The uptake of the radiotracer in the 99mTc-sulphur colloid scan is a key finding that supports the accessory spleen diagnosis, as it indicates that the mass is functioning splenic tissue.",A,FALSE,B
14503,205045,A 75-year-old woman taking warfarin for AF falls and sustains a head injury. She undergoes a CT scan which shows an intraparenchymal haemorrhage. She is managed conservatively and 36 hours later undergoes an MRI scan for follow up. What will the likely appearance of the haemorrhage be now? Select ONE answer only.,SBA: Central Nervous and Head & Neck,Dark on T1 and dark on T2,Isointense on T1 and bright on T2,Dark on T1 and bright on T2,Bright on T1 and dark on T2,Bright on T1 and bright on T2,A,31%,13%,4%,47%,5%,"Explanation:
At 2 days old, the bleed is acute; iso/dark on T1 and dark on T2. Chronic bleeds are dark on T1 and dark-rimmed on T2 (bright centre).
This question is to do with the imaging characteristics of blood within the brain. We can think of the intracranial space as a closed box as far as oxygen tensions go which means that blood degrades in a predictable fashion and therefore has predictable appearances on T1 and T2 according to the changes in the haemoglobin molecule. There are a few different methods to help remember the changes in appearance, one of which is the table below:
  Time-frame Haemoglobin T1 T2 Mnemonic
Hyperacute (hours)   Iso Bright - IBBY
Acute (0-2 days) Intracellular deoxyHb Dark / Iso Dark - IDDY
Early subacute (3-7 days) Intracellular metHb Bright Dark - BIDDY
Late subacute (8-30 days) Extracellular metHb Bright Bright - BABY
Chronic (> 30 days) Intracellular haemosiderin Dark Dark rim - DODO
  In real life and for the 2b exam the important distinction is around the subacute stages.
In that case, by and large, if it is bright on T1 it is subacute and T2 then decides if it is early or late subacute. The timeframes given are also important and can form the basis of 2a exam questions.
 Signal from chronic haematoma often causes confusion since the T2 signal in particular can be quite variable. In general the haematoma will show a dark haemosiderin ring on T2 weighted images but since the centre becomes effectively CSF, or CSF-like fluid, it can follow CSF signal and would therefore return high signal on T2 weighted sequences.
  Of the other answers provided therefore:
Bright on T1 and dark on T2 = Early subacute
Dark on T1 and bright on T2 = Chronic
Dark on T1 and dark on T2 = Acute
Isointense on T1 and bright on T2 = Hyperacute
Bright on T1 and bright on T2 = Late subacute",FALSE,"The correct answer is 3. Dark on T1 and bright on T2. This is because intraparenchymal haemorrhages appear dark on T1 and bright on T2 due to the presence of methaemoglobin, which has high T2 signal and low T1 signal.",1,"3. A question about interpretation of data, such as lab results or imaging?

3. A question about interpretation of data, such as lab results or imaging.",D,FALSE,"I chose option 2 (Dark on T1 and bright on T2) because it best represents the typical appearance of a subacute intraparenchymal hemorrhage on MRI at 36 hours post-injury. 

At this stage, the hemorrhage is in the subacute phase, where the hemoglobin in the blood starts to break down into various products. One of these products is extracellular methemoglobin, which typically appears hypointense (dark) on T1-weighted images and hyperintense (bright) on T2-weighted images. This is due to the paramagnetic properties of methemoglobin, which cause these distinct signal changes on MRI.",C,TRUE,A

Which SINGLE statement regarding the cruciate ligaments of the knee is FALSE?,SBA: Musculoskeletal and Trauma,The PCL attaches distally to the lateral epicondyle of the femur,The ACL is the weaker of the two ligaments,The ACL attaches distally to the posterior part of the lateral condyle of the femur,The two ligaments cross each other,The ACL arises from the anterior part of the intercondylar area of the tibia,A,53%,15%,18%,4%,10%,"Explanation:
There are two cruciate ligaments that help to stabilize the knee joint. They connect the femur and the tibia and cross each other in doing so.
The anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) is the weaker of the two ligaments. It arises from the anterior part of the intercondylar area of the tibia and extends superiorly, posteriorly and laterally to attach to the posterior part of the lateral condyle of the femur.
The posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) arises from the posterior part of the intercondylar area of the tibia and passes superiorly and anteriorly on the medial side of the ACL to attach to the anterior part of the lateral surface of the medial condyle of the femur.",TRUE,"The PCL attaches distally to the medial epicondyle of the femur, not the lateral epicondyle. The lateral epicondyle is the attachment site for the lateral collateral ligament (LCL).",1,"This question falls under category 1: Basic factual recall, either of basic science, physics, anatomy or regarding a procedure.",C,TRUE,"I chose option 2 because it is the false statement regarding the cruciate ligaments of the knee.

14285,205045,You are reviewing the PET-CT scan of a patient with a known lung malignancy. The scan confirms a thoracic lesion showing avid uptake but there is also avidity in the right vocal cord. What is the likely location of the primary lesion? Select ONE answer only.,SBA: Cardiothoracic and vascular,AP window,Right upper lobe,Lingular,Right middle lobe,Right paratracheal,A,64%,13%,2%,2%,19%,"Explanation:
Focal unilateral vocal cord uptake on a PET-CT scan is more likely to be due to the increased workload of the contralateral vocal cord muscles compensating for ipsilateral paralysis from involvement of the ipsilateral recurrent laryngeal nerve in the chest rather than metastatic infiltration of the contralateral vocal cord itself.
Vocal cord paralysis is a known sign of thoracic malignancy owing to innervation by the recurrent laryngeal nerve.
Left - passes through the aortopulmonary window, under the aorta 
Right - passes under the right subclavian artery
  Infiltration of one of these nerves would lead to a unilateral vocal cord palsy. Since the left has a longer thoracic course, it is at greater risk of involvement in a thoracic malignancy. Infiltration may be by the index mass itself, or by an involved lymph node distant from the primary mass.",FALSE,The presence of avid uptake in the right vocal cord suggests that the primary lesion is located in the right upper lobe. This is because the right vocal cord is located in the same area as the right upper lobe and the uptake of the PET-CT scan indicates that the lesion is located there.,2,,B,TRUE,"I chose option 2 (AP window) because the PET-CT scan shows avidity in both the thoracic lesion and the right vocal cord. The AP (aortopulmonary) window is a mediastinal location, and primary tumors in this area can cause direct invasion or compression of the recurrent laryngeal nerve, which controls the vocal cords. This involvement of the right vocal cord suggests that the primary lesion is located in the AP window, as it is more likely to affect the nerve in this location compared to other options.",A,FALSE,B
10816,205045,A 59-year-old man known to have HIV undergoes a CXR which shows new nodular shadowing in the right upper lobe. What is the most likely diagnosis?,SBA: Cardiothoracic and vascular,Tuberculosis,PCP,Cryptococcus,Histoplasma,CMV,A,63%,19%,7%,5%,6%,"Explanation:
The opportunistic infections consequent on AIDS have a variety of radiological manifestations. The normal range for CD4 lymphocytes is 800-1000 per mm3. As the patient becomes increasingly immunocompromised different diseases appear.
  Image © Medical Exam Prep
  Tuberculosis
In AIDs patients the radiological appearance of an infection with tuberculosis changes depending on the CD4 count although, of the HIV related diseases, tuberculosis can occur at a far higher CD4 count.
<350cells/mm3 – resembles post-primary TB
<200cells/mm3 – resembles primary TB or miliary TB
Primary tuberculosis leads to consolidation with lymph node enlargement and pleural effusions. Of note the lymph nodes can be low in attenuation with rim enhancement.
Post-primary tuberculosis is often seen as cavitation in upper lobe consolidative lesions on a background of characteristic tree-in-bud appearance. It can progress to fibrosis with volume loss and traction bronchiectasis.
  There are a number of eponymous features of tuberculosis infection.
A Simon focus – this is the healed site of a primary infection in the apex of the lung
A Ghon lesion – this is a calcified lugn lesion <5mm in diameter
A Ranke complex – this refers to the presence of a Ghon lesion as well as calcified lymph nodes
A Rasmussen aneurysm – this is a pulmonary artery aneurysm within the wall of a tuberculous cavity
    Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) – also known as pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP)
PCP has many different appearances on imaging. Bilateral ground glass opacification (GGO) is the most consistent feature and is often seen in a perihilar and basilar distribution. Approximately half of cases show a patchwork pattern of GGO where there is sparing of some pulmonary segments. The ‘black bronchus’ sign can be seen where the extent of ground glass opacification causes the bronchi to appear black against the GGO. Lung cysts (pneumatocoeles) are also a feature, hence the name. PCP is usually not thought to be associated with lymph nodes or effusions but either or both can be seen in approximately 15% of cases. Similarly pneumothoraces are a complicating feature in around 12% of cases. Largely speaking however these three are usually described to be absent in an exam question setting.
Owing to the severity of the illness, many patients receive prophylaxis with aerosolized pentamidine and this can lead to an alternative presentation with upper lobe disease. These patients are more likely to experience a spontaneous pneumothorax than those not on prophylaxis.
The presenting symptoms of patients with PCP are relatively non-specific: dysponea, dry cough, and malaise. The CD4 count, if given, should be <200cells/mm3.
  CMV pneumonia 
Infection with CMV is common among AIDS patients but not all cases are diagnosed prior to the autopsy prevalence of over 50%; it does not cause significant morbidity or mortality. When it does manifest radiologically the findings are relatively non-specific with bronchiectasis, nodules and hazy infiltrates seen in a bilateral symmetrical distribution. It is often diagnosed concurrently with Kaposi sarcoma. There can be significant overlap between the appearances of CMV pneumonia and PCP. The main differences to look for would be an apical predominance for PCP (especially in those taking prophylactic pentamidine), and the presence of cysts in PCP.
  Cryptococcal pneumonia 
Masses and nodules with or without both lymph nodes and effusions are the main findings for cryptococcal pneumonia in AIDs patients. Cavity formation within lung masses can also be seen ergo cryptococcal pneumonia is one of the differential diagnoses for cavitating lung lesions. The patients often also have concurrent cerebral cryptococcal disease. The fungus is found in bird excreta which can sometimes be a pointer in an exam question setting.
  Histoplasmosis
In immunocompetent individuals infection with histoplasmosis is sub-clinical in the vast majority of cases. In immunodeficient patients however it is a different story; it can be fatal. AIDs patients are at risk if their CD4 count is below 150cells/mm3.
Patients present in a non-specific manner with fever, malaise, diarrhoea, and vomiting but around half will have no CXR findings. On CT miliary disease is seen as well as reticulonodular and air space opacities. Like cryptococcal, histoplasma is found in bird excreta.",TRUE,"I chose this answer because tuberculosis is the most common cause of nodular shadowing in the right upper lobe of a person with HIV. Tuberculosis is an infectious disease caused by the bacteria Mycobacterium tuberculosis, which can affect any part of the body, including the lungs. People with HIV are at an increased risk of contracting tuberculosis due to their weakened immune system.",2,,A,TRUE,"I chose option 2, Tuberculosis, as the most likely diagnosis for the following reasons:

1. The patient is a 59-year-old man with a known history of HIV, which puts him at a higher risk for opportunistic infections, including tuberculosis (TB).

2. The CXR shows new nodular shadowing in the right upper lobe, which is a common radiographic finding in patients with pulmonary tuberculosis. TB often presents as nodular infiltrates or cavitations in the upper lobes of the lungs.

3. Although the other options (PCP, Cryptococcus, Histoplasma, and CMV) are also potential opportunistic infections in HIV patients, their typical radiographic findings do not match the described CXR findings in this case as closely as tuberculosis does.

However, it is important to note that a definitive diagnosis would require further investigation, such as sputum samples for acid-fast bacilli (AFB) staining and culture, as well as potentially a biopsy or bronchoscopy.",A,FALSE,E
14067,205045,"A 14-year-old patient undergoes MRCP for further investigation of new onset diabetes and deranged liver function tests. This demonstrates a rounded pancreatic head with absence of the neck, body and tail of pancreas. Only fat signal is seen in the pancreatic bed in these regions.

What is the most likely underlying diagnosis? Select ONE answer only.",SBA: Gastrointestinal,Dorsal pancreatic agenesis,Ventral pancreatic agenesis,Lipomatosis,Steroid use,Cushing syndrome,A,80%,9%,9%,1%,1%,"Explanation:
The dorsal pancreas is the neck, body and tail. The ventral pancreas is the head.
The key differentiator between dorsal pancreatic agenesis and lipomatosis is the absence of the pancreatic duct. If no duct is visualised, this suggests agenesis over lipomatosis. Furthermore, lipomatosis usually affects the whole gland and does not spare the pancreatic head. Dorsal agenesis is much more common than total pancreatic agenesis.
The most common cause of pancreatic lipomatosis in children is cystic fibrosis, the second most common cause is Shwachman-Diamond syndrome. Additional features of this condition include short stature with metaphyseal chondroplasia and eczema. Steroid use and Cushing syndrome are also associated with lipomatosis.",FALSE,"Ventral pancreatic agenesis is the most likely underlying diagnosis in this case. This condition is characterized by the absence of the neck, body, and tail of the pancreas, with only fat signal seen in the pancreatic bed in these regions. Additionally, the pancreatic duct is not identified distal to the pancreatic head. This is in contrast to lipomatosis, which is an accumulation of fat in the pancreas, and steroid use, Cushing syndrome, and dorsal pancreatic agenesis, which all involve the presence of the neck, body, and tail of the pancreas.",2,,B,FALSE,"I chose option 1, ventral pancreatic agenesis, because the description of the MRCP findings matches this condition. The absence of the neck, body, and tail of the pancreas, along with only fat signal seen in the pancreatic bed in these regions, suggests that a part of the pancreas is missing. Ventral pancreatic agenesis is a congenital anomaly where the ventral part of the pancreas fails to develop, which can result in the absence of the neck, body, and tail of the pancreas. The other options do not fit the description of the findings, as they do not typically present with the absence of significant portions of the pancreas.",B,TRUE,A
10296,205045,A 36-year-old woman has a cardiac MRI for investigation of shortness of breath. The pericardium measures 5mm in depth. Her right atrium is enlarged with a small right ventricle.

Inflammation of the pericardium is termed pericarditis and leads to fibrous thickening. Most commonly this occurs either post-operatively in patients undergoing cardiac surgery or as an idiopathic entity although historically it was tuberculosis which was the most common cause of pericarditis. The diagnosis is predominantly clinical with symptoms such as malaise or dyspnoea and signs such as neck vein distension or paradoxical movement of the JVP. On cross sectional imaging thickening of the pericardium to greater than 2mm can be seen and the fibrosis causes a restriction in distensibility. The right ventricle, being more compliant than the left, becomes flattened and furthermore there can be curvature of the septum towards the left. Counterintuitively the right atrium can also be dilated; this secondary to the high filling pressure in the right ventricle. Elsewhere, if the field of view permits, accessory signs such as pleural effusions and even ascites may be seen.",TRUE,"Constrictive pericarditis is the most likely diagnosis based on the given information. The patient's enlarged right atrium and small right ventricle are consistent with right heart failure, which is a common symptom of constrictive pericarditis. Additionally, the finding of a pericardium measuring 5mm in depth is consistent with constrictive pericarditis, as this is a thickening of the pericardium that can lead to impaired ventricular filling and heart failure. The other conditions listed are not typically associated with right heart failure and/or thickening of the pericardium.",2,,A,TRUE,"I chose option 2, Constrictive pericarditis, as the most likely diagnosis because the patient's symptoms and imaging findings align with this condition. 

Constrictive pericarditis occurs when the pericardium, the sac surrounding the heart, becomes thickened and less flexible. This can lead to impaired filling of the heart chambers, which in turn can cause right-sided heart failure. The patient's cardiac MRI shows a thickened pericardium (5mm in depth) and an enlarged right atrium with a small right ventricle, which are consistent with constrictive pericarditis. Additionally, the patient is experiencing shortness of breath and has clinical features of right heart failure, further supporting this diagnosis. 

The other options are less likely based on the given information:

1. Tricuspid regurgitation may cause right-sided heart failure, but it would not typically cause pericardial thickening.
3. Marfan syndrome is a connective tissue disorder that primarily affects the skeletal, ocular, and cardiovascular systems. While it can cause cardiovascular issues, the findings described in this case are not typical for Marfan syndrome.
4. Ehlers-Danlos syndrome is another connective tissue disorder, but it is not typically associated with the cardiac findings described in this case.

Pseudomembranous colitis
Antibiotic therapy, particularly with broad spectrum penicillins, can deplete the normal colonic flora and permit overgrowth of clostridium difficile. Some patients may be asymptomatic from this overgrowth but others can develop pseudomembranous colitis. There will be a profuse watery diarrhoea with abdominal pains and fever. The condition is defined by the development of a pseudomembrane of exuded fibrin and cellular debris within the colon seen on endoscopy. Both endoscopic and fluoroscopic examinations are contraindicated in severe cases owing to the risk of perforation. On CT around a third of patients have no findings at all but more usually there is diffuse colonic wall thickening affecting the entire colon and to an extent which is not seen in any other disease process (except Crohn disease).The accordion sign occurs when oral contrast medium sits between the closely spaced oedematous folds of the colon. Pericolonic fat stranding is disproportionately mild but ascites is a common co-existent finding. Complicating features which should be ruled out on a CT scan include toxic megacolon, pneumatosis coli and portal venous gas. Gas in the bile ducts (pneumobilia) is not an expected complication.",FALSE,"Pneumatosis coli is not a complication of pseudomembranous colitis. Pneumatosis coli is a condition in which air or gas is present in the wall of the colon, and is usually caused by a disruption of the mucosal barrier. It can be seen in a variety of conditions, including inflammatory bowel disease, ischemia, and infection. Pseudomembranous colitis, on the other hand, is an infection caused by the overgrowth of Clostridium difficile bacteria, which leads to inflammation and damage to the colonic mucosa.

Pseudomembranous colitis is an infection of the colon caused by the bacterium Clostridium difficile, which leads to inflammation and the formation of pseudomembranes in the colon.

Select ONE answer only.,"SBA: Genito urinary, Adrenal, Obstetrics & Gynaecology and Breast",Orchitis,Lymphoma,Leukaemia,Metastases,Sarcoidosis,A,72%,12%,6%,4%,6%,"Explanation:
Please note the question asks for the LEAST likely diagnosis.
The differential diagnosis for bilateral testicular masses is reasonably short. Lymphoma is the most likely cause, especially in men aged over 60. Sarcoidosis is also a common cause of this uncommon finding. Leukaemia is difficult to differentiate from lymphoma on imaging alone and the two are usually discussed in tandem. Testicular metastases are most common in patients over the age of 50 and the primary site is most commonly prostate or lung.
Orchitis is unlikely to present as a testicular lump and tends to be a more diffuse process rather than hypoechoic masses. Bilateral testicular abscesses could be a differential diagnosis however clinical correlation is key.
Lymphoma and leukaemia
Testicular lymphoma is uncommon but important. In men over the age of 60 it is the most common testicular malignancy and in men of any age it is the most common bilateral testicular malignancy (although it is not always bilateral).

1. Lymphoma: Testicular lymphoma is the most common secondary testicular tumor and can present with bilateral involvement.
2. Leukaemia: Testicular infiltration by leukemia can lead to testicular masses and can involve both testicles.
3. Orchitis: Inflammation of the testicles can occur bilaterally due to infections or other causes.

Please note that the question asks which sign is NOT a sign of aortic transection.
Obviously surgical emphysema is not unlikely in the overall setting of trauma however it is not a direct sign of aortic transection.
An aortic transection is highly likely to be next-to immediately fatal. Formation of a pseudoaneurysm at the transection site can sometimes contain extravasation but the scenario of a patient surviving long enough to receive even a chest x-ray otherwise seems a little far-fetched but does occur in exceptional circumstances. Disruption to the aortic contour and bilateral pleural effusions are given as signs of aortic transaction. The trachea is shifted to the right by mass effect from the enlarging haematoma around the aorta.",FALSE,"I chose 4 because pleural effusions are not typically associated with a diagnosis of aortic transection. The other signs, such as trachea shift to the right, widening of the upper mediastinum, and an indistinct aortic contour are all signs that may point to an aortic transection.",2,"3. A question about clinical management, what is the best course of action?

This question falls under category 2: A question about clinical judgement, what is the correct diagnosis?",D,TRUE,"I chose ""5. Surgical emphysema"" because it is not a likely sign of a diagnosis of aortic transection. Surgical emphysema, also known as subcutaneous emphysema, refers to the presence of air or gas in the subcutaneous tissue, usually resulting from trauma or surgery. This finding is not directly related to aortic transection.

Aortic transection is a life-threatening injury that occurs when the aorta, the largest artery in the body, is torn or ruptured. The signs of aortic transection on a chest x-ray typically include:

1. Trachea shift to the right: This can occur due to the widening of the mediastinum, which pushes the trachea to the right side.
2. Widening of the upper mediastinum: This can be a result of blood accumulating around the aorta due to the rupture.
3. Pleural effusions: Blood from the ruptured aorta can leak into the pleural space, causing fluid accumulation.
4. Indistinct aortic contour: The presence of blood around the aorta can make its borders appear less distinct on an x-ray.

13911,205045,A 70-year-old man undergoes an MRI scan of the base of his skull. He has previously undergone surgery for a left sided cholesteatoma and the surgeon is concerned there may be a recurrence. Within the surgical cavity on the left there is a mass which enhances on the post-contrast sequences but doesn’t restrict diffusion. What is the most likely diagnosis? Select ONE answer only.,SBA: Central Nervous and Head & Neck,Granulation tissue,Recurrent cholesteatoma,Post-operative fluid,Otitis media,Cholesterol granuloma,A,81%,6%,2%,3%,9%,"Explanation:
Cholesteatomas are difficult to manage as they have a high recurrence rate. Imaging has a significant role to play in the management of recurrent cholesteatomas; distinguishing recurrence from post-operative granulation tissue or fluid is important.
  Diagnosis Restricts Diffusion Enhances
Recurrent cholesteatoma Yes No
Granulation tissue No Yes
Fluid No No
  Post-contrast sequences for recurrent cholesteatomas require a delay of around 45 minutes from giving the contrast to acquiring images as the granulation tissue is slow to take up contrast. This has obvious down-sides to any modern day busy MRI schedule. However since the management of post-operative granulation tissue and post-operative fluid is largely identical, namely expectant, it is not important to differentiate the one from the other. Thus findings on diffusion weighted sequences are the most important thing in post-operative cholesteatoma imaging.
  Cholesteatoma
Cholesteatomas (Acquired or congenital) are histolologically epidermoid cysts. On imaging the finding of non-dependant soft tissue and bony erosion within the middle ear is typical for a cholesteatoma.
There are two types of acquired cholesteatoma:
Pars flaccida (80%) – classically erodes the scutum and extends superiorly
Pars tensa (20%) – classically erodes the ossicles, extending medially
  These refer to the two parts of the tympanic membrane from which they arise.
  Image © Medical Exam Prep
  In due course, if left unattended, a cholesteatoma will expand to fill the entire middle ear. Prior to this point they can be seen as non-dependant soft tissue within the middle ear. Dependant soft tissue within the middle ear suggests the presence of fluid or pus and the diagnosis of a middle ear infection. Once a cholesteatoma has filled the middle ear completely however no gas remains from which to discern dependency.
There are a number of theories as to how cholesteatomas arise. One theory is that following a perforation of the tympanic membrane entry of desquamated stratified keratinised squamous epithelium from the external auditory canal into the middle ear is permitted. There it adheres to the tympanic membrane and proliferates unrelentingly causing a soft tissue mass to form and eventually leading to bony erosion of the ossicles, scutum and/or other parts of the middle ear.
A congenital cholesteatoma behaves in a similar manner but is present from birth due to an aberrant location of a tiny island of keratinised squamous epithelium.
  Cholesterol granuloma
A cholesterol granuloma occurs as a sequela of recurrent bouts of otitis media. Haemorrhage within the middle ear leads to the formation of granulation tissue. On imaging this is seen as opacification of the middle ear on CT. Bony changes can occur chronically with bony expansion, or displacement and even destruction of the ossicles. The signals characteristics on MRI are therefore important to distinguish it from a cholesteatoma. Whereas a cholesteatoma on MRI is isointense to brain parenchyma on T1, a cholesterol granuloma will show high signal in the middle ear on T1 due to the paramagnetic effects of methaemoglobin. On clinical examination the ENT surgeon may report a bulging blue tympanic membrane. This is classical. Dehiscence of the jugular bulb is an important differential diagnosis to exclude as this will also give a blue tympanic membrane on examination but the management is radically different!",FALSE,"Recurrent cholesteatoma is the most likely diagnosis because the mass is located within the surgical cavity on the left where the cholesteatoma was previously removed, and it enhances on the post-contrast sequences. This is a classic sign of recurrent cholesteatoma. Granulation tissue, post-operative fluid, otitis media, and cholesterol granuloma are all less likely diagnoses.",2,,B,TRUE,"I chose option 4, granulation tissue, because the clinical scenario and MRI findings are consistent with this diagnosis. The patient has a history of surgery for a left-sided cholesteatoma, and the surgeon is concerned about a recurrence. Granulation tissue is commonly found in post-operative cases as it is a part of the normal healing process. The mass enhances on post-contrast sequences, which is typical for granulation tissue due to its increased vascularity. Additionally, the mass does not show restricted diffusion, which helps to differentiate it from a recurrent cholesteatoma, as cholesteatomas typically show restricted diffusion.",A,TRUE,A

There is a differential diagnosis for lytic lesions of the skull.
Parietal foramina
This is a benign congenital condition where the parietal bones fail to completely ossify leading to paired defects in the characteristic para-sagittal location. There are ususally no clinical consequences.
Eosinophilic granuloma causes round punched-out type lesions, usually described as having a bevelled edge. These would usually be solitary although multiple lesions are definitely possible. The symmetry of the lesions described in the question goes against this on grounds of probability though.
Fibrous dysplasia can affect the skull. It is usually described as having a ground glass appearance with cortical expansion and a swell-defined sclerotic margin.
Osteogenesis imperfecta is not usually part of the differential diagnosis for lytic lesions in the skull. Multiple wormian bones are part of the diagnostic criteria and at a stretch leptomeningeal cysts caused by skull fractures due to fragility could be brought into the picture.
Sinus pericranii is largely a soft tissue (vascular) mass which can cause secondary effects on the skull, including a localised defect. Again though, bilateral symmetrical defects would be unusual.",FALSE,"Fibrous dysplasia is the most likely diagnosis because it is the most common cause of symmetrical lucencies in the skull vault on a Townes' view.

Select ONE answer only.",SBA: Cardiothoracic and vascular,MRI with delayed contrast,Invasive angiogram,Dobutamine stress MRI,Adenosine stress MRI,Cardiac CT,A,85%,2%,4%,7%,3%,"Explanation:
This man has acute myocarditis. An MRI with delayed contrast should confirm this with either epicardial or midwall delayed enhancement. A cardiac CT or invasive angiogram will give information about the coronary vessels and the stress tests are better suited to revealing compensated areas of hypoperfusion. Treatment can be initiated while the patient is waiting to have their MRI.
      Image © Medical Exam Prep
      Adenosine stress MRI has overtaken dobutamine stress MRI in terms of sensitivity and specificity for investigating the presence of ischaemia or infarction. Adenosine causes coronary vasodilation. If there is a haemodynamically significant stenosis to a coronary vessel, the vessels distal to the stenosis are already maximally dilated to maximise flow and thus the application of adenosine makes no difference to the vessel calibre or the resultant perfusion. Furthermore, the vasodilatation to the remaining unoccluded vessels can 'steal' blood from the stenosed territory and this is seen as hypoperfusion to the affected territory. Dipyridamole (antiplatelet), blocks uptake of adenosine and so patients taking this are also poor candidates for this test, however dipyridimole itself can also induce vasodilatation so may be used as an agent in its own right instead of adenosine.
Contraindications to adenosine include:
Second or third degree heart block
Bronchospasm
Hypotension <90mmHg systolic
Myocardial infarction within 48hrs
Uncontrolled arrhythmia
Severe/critical aortic stenosis
The half-life of adenosine is exceptionally short, around 10 seconds, thus any side effects experienced during the scan resolve very quickly. It also means that during the scan, in order to maintain the effect, the adenosine must be given as an infusion.
  Dobutamine stress MRI used to be used but has largely been superseded by adenosine stress MRIs. Dobutamine is a sympathomimetic so works by inducing the heart to beat both faster and stronger. By increasing the stress on the whole heart, hitherto compensated areas are unmasked. The drug is given at increasing doses ever 3 minutes until any of:
The heart rate has increased to around 85% of its resting maximum
New wall motion abnormality is seen
Blood pressure rises above 240/220mmHg
Systolic blood pressure falls by 40mmHg
The patient develops persistent arrhythmias
The patient becomes too symptomatic to continue the scan
  Aside from the usual contra-indications to performing the MRI in the first place, specific contra-indications to performing a dobutamine stress MRI include:
Hypertension >220/120mmHg
Unstable angina
Aortic stenosis (severe)
Uncontrolled atrial fibrillation
Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy
Congestive heart failure
  A stress echocardiogram is particularly useful for further investigating patients in whom a stress ECG was inconclusive. Many patients are unable to tolerate the physical demands (treadmill) of a stress ECG. Patients are given dobutamine, much like for a stress cardiac MRI study. Wall-motion abnormalities can be seen, as with cardiac MRI, and these correspond to areas of non-viable or hibernating myocardium and provide targets for revascularisation. An echocardiogram has the obvious advantages of lower cost, wider availability and faster scanning time than an MRI. The contra-indications to this test are the same as those for cardiac MRI.
  Cardiac CT is indicated for acute cardiac or major vessel pathology as it is quick and more readily available than MRI. It can be used to assess the calcium-score of the coronary arteries as well as patency/occlusions to identify targets for acute revascularisation. It is also useful for quantifying aneurysmal dilatation of the aortic root.
  An invasive angiogram is also indicated for acute ischaemic cardiac pathology, particularly in the presence of ECG changes suggesting an acute myocardial infarction. Ideally this can then lead to endovascular stenting or clot-retrieval to open up the target artery. The procedure is obviously not without risk but can be life-saving, and is still considered as the gold standard for diagnosing coronary artery stenosis however the fact of stenosis does not provide information on the effect of the underlying myocardium. In the acute scenario it is reasonable to assume that a stenosed vessel is the cause of the symptoms but the picture is less straightforward in sub-acute or chronic chest pains.",TRUE,"I chose 4 because MRI with delayed contrast is the best test to perform to confirm the diagnosis of myocarditis. This test can help to identify areas of inflammation and necrosis in the heart muscle, which are characteristic of myocarditis. In addition, MRI with delayed contrast can help to differentiate between myocarditis and other causes of chest pain, such as ischemia.",2,"3. A question about clinical decision making, what is the next best test?",A,TRUE,"I chose option 4, MRI with delayed contrast, because it is the most appropriate test to confirm the diagnosis of myocarditis in this clinical scenario. 

Myocarditis is an inflammatory condition of the heart muscle, often caused by viral infections, which can present with symptoms similar to a myocardial infarction. An MRI with delayed contrast, also known as a late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) MRI, is a highly sensitive and specific imaging technique for detecting myocardial inflammation and fibrosis.

In this case, the patient has already undergone an ECG, troponin tests, and an echocardiogram, which have provided some evidence of myocardial injury. However, these tests are not definitive for myocarditis. An MRI with delayed contrast can help confirm the diagnosis by visualizing areas of inflammation and fibrosis in the heart muscle, which are characteristic findings in myocarditis.

The other options listed are not as appropriate for diagnosing myocarditis:
1. Invasive angiogram is primarily used to evaluate coronary artery disease, which is not the primary concern in this case.
2. Dobutamine stress MRI is used to assess myocardial ischemia and viability, but it is not specific for myocarditis.
3. Adenosine stress MRI is also used to evaluate myocardial ischemia, which is not the main concern in this scenario.

Acute haemorrhage has Hounsfield units of anything up to 80. Clinically the patient’s symptoms and the time frame fit well with haemorrhage. A major post-procedural haemorrhage three weeks after the biopsy would be unusual. The patient is the right age to have had an aneurysm.
Bile has Hounsfield Units very close to water. The liver produces a surprisingly large volume of bile and thus when a bile leak is present the patient can have significant abdominal distension with bile. Bile leaks typically present within the first week or two following a procedure.",FALSE,"A subcapsular haematoma is the most concerning option in this case because it can cause severe and life-threatening complications. Subcapsular haematomas can cause compression of the liver, leading to decreased perfusion, shock, and even death. Additionally, a large and ill-defined collection of blood with a density of 80HU on a CT scan is highly suggestive of a subcapsular haematoma.",3,"3. A question about the management of a patient, what is the best course of action?

This question falls under Question 2: A question about clinical judgement, what is the correct diagnosis?",B,FALSE,"I chose option 3 (Abscess) because the patient's presentation of tachycardia, hypotension, and a significant drop in hemoglobin, combined with the CT findings of a large ill-defined collection inferomedial to the liver with parts measuring 80 HU (Hounsfield Units), are suggestive of an abscess. An abscess is a collection of pus that has accumulated within a tissue due to an infection, and it can cause systemic symptoms such as fever, tachycardia, and hypotension. The high Hounsfield Units (80 HU) indicate that the collection is not a simple fluid (which would have lower HU values) but rather has a higher density, consistent with an abscess.

In this clinical scenario, an abscess is a more likely and concerning complication following a liver biopsy than the other options provided. A subcapsular hematoma or parenchymal hemorrhage would typically present earlier after the procedure and have different imaging characteristics. A bile leak would also have different imaging findings and may not cause the systemic symptoms described.

The apophysis of the fifth metatarsal is laterally placed with respect to the diaphysis. It appears around the age of 11 and fuses within around 3 years.
Fractures of the base of the fifth metatarsal typically occur at 90o to the diaphysis.
Peroneus brevis inserts onto the lateral aspect of the base of the fifth metatarsal.
Peroneus longus follows a similar course to peroneus brevis initially but then crosses the plantar surface of the metatarsal heads and inserts into the base of the first metatarsal.",FALSE,"I chose this answer because it is the most common finding for a fracture to the base of the 5th metatarsal. This type of fracture is typically a transverse fracture, meaning that it is at a 90 degree angle to the diaphysis (shaft of the bone). It is also usually unstable, meaning that the fracture fragments are displaced from each other, and it is usually associated with an avulsion of the peroneus longus, which is a tendon that runs along the lateral side of the foot.",1,"3. A question about the application of knowledge, what would be the best course of action?

This question would fall under Option 1: Basic factual recall, either of basic science, physics, anatomy or regarding a procedure.",A,TRUE,"I chose option 1 because a fracture to the base of the 5th metatarsal is most commonly associated with an avulsion fracture, which occurs when a small fragment of bone is pulled away by the tendon or ligament. In this case, the peroneus brevis tendon is the one most commonly involved. This type of fracture usually presents with a fracture line at a 90-degree angle to the diaphysis (the shaft of the bone) and is considered stable.

The CT demonstrates a large, heterogeneous, enhancing mass which fills the entire right hemithorax and is displacing the mediastinum to the left. No rib destruction is seen, despite the mass pressing against the chest wall. What is the most likely diagnosis?",SBA: Paediatrics,Pleuropulmonary blastoma,Askin Tumour,Ewings tumour,Neuroblastoma,Lymphoma,A,76%,8%,1%,11%,3%,"Explanation:
An extremely large hemithoracic mass in a 1-2-year-old child is almost always either an Askin tumour or Pleuropulmonary blastoma. Rib or bony involvement is the key differentiation feature. Pleuropulmonary blastoma does not cause rib destruction, whereas an Askin tumour would.
  Pleuropulmonary blastoma
This is a primary intrathoracic malignancy. It can resemble a Congenital Cystic Adenoid Malformation. They generally do not contain calcification and 'never' invade the skeleton. There is an association with multilocular cystic nephroma in around 10% of cases.
  Askin Tumour
These heterogenous tumours are part of the Ewing Sarcoma spectrum. Patients are often in their early teens. Askin tumours displace rather than invade adjacent mediastinal structures. Rib destruction is common and is a fact which can help distinguish it from a pleuropulmonary blastoma which is another cause of a large mediastinal mass, albeit usually found in children under the age of 2, but which does not cause rib destruction.
  Neuroblastoma
For a posterior mediastinal mass in a child under the age of 10, a neuroblastoma should be the top differential diagnosis to be considered. Usually it is heterogeneous with calcification and areas of necrosis.
  Lymphoma
This is the most common anterior mediastinal mass in children. It may be difficult to differentiate a lymphoma from normal thymus, particularly in a patient younger than 10 years of age. Associated lymphadenopathy (i.e. cervical) can be the key to distinguishing the two pathologies. Calcification is rare prior to any treatment but can be a feature of lymphoma which has been treated.",FALSE,"Neuroblastoma is the most likely diagnosis because it is the most common solid tumor in children, and it typically presents with a large mass which fills the entire hemithorax and displaces the mediastinum to the left. Neuroblastoma can also cause rib destruction, although in this case it is not seen on the CT scan. Additionally, Neuroblastoma is typically seen in infants and young children, which fits the age of this patient.",2,,A,FALSE,"I chose Askin Tumor (option 1) as the most likely diagnosis because the clinical presentation and CT findings are consistent with this type of tumor. Askin Tumor, also known as peripheral primitive neuroectodermal tumor (PNET) of the chest wall, is a rare and aggressive malignancy that typically affects children and young adults.

The patient's age (18-month-old boy) is consistent with the typical age range for Askin Tumor. The symptoms of general malaise, shortness of breath, and absent air entry in the right hemithorax suggest a large mass in the chest, which is confirmed by the CT findings. The large, heterogeneous, enhancing mass filling the entire right hemithorax and displacing the mediastinum to the left is a characteristic finding in Askin Tumor. Additionally, the absence of rib destruction despite the mass pressing against the chest wall further supports this diagnosis.

What is the most likely diagnosis?,SBA: Musculoskeletal and Trauma,Pott disease,Pyogenic abscess,Scheuermann disease,Rhabdomyosarcoma,Parosteal sarcoma,A,64%,4%,3%,10%,19%,"Explanation:
Tuberculous spondylitis also known as Pott disease
Around half of patients have no pulmonary disease and spondylitis accounts for around 5% of all infections with tuberculosis. The L1 vertebral body is the most commonly affected level but usually more than one levels is affected. Within the vertebral body it is the anterior aspect which is affected first. This is thought to be due to the subligamentous spread of the bacterium, under the anterior longitudinal ligament. The disc height is usually preserved until relatively late on in the disease which can make the condition very difficult to detect on x-ray since neither periosteal reactions nor reactive sclerosis are likely to be seen either. Calcification to the disc is common though, and virtually pathognomonic when present.
  Phemister triad
Of articular tuberculosis it is the spine which is most commonly affected however the hips and knees can also be affected. The Phemister triad describes three classical features of tuberculous arthropathy which are common to all the joints affected:
Juxta-articular osteoporosis
Marginal erosions
Gradual reduction of the joint space
Differentiating tuberculous spondylitis from pyogenic spondylitis is crucial and there are a number of features which can help.
  Tuberculous discitis
Staphylococcal discitis
Calcification (almost pathognomonic)
No calcification

   ",FALSE,"I chose number 5 because a parosteal sarcoma is a type of soft tissue sarcoma that is characterized by a slow growing, painless mass that is usually found in the paraspinal area near the spine. The MRI scan showing a paraspinal mass with amorphous calcification and strong enhancement of the edges is consistent with the imaging characteristics of a parosteal sarcoma.",2,,E,FALSE,"I chose option 4, Parosteal sarcoma, because the MRI findings described in the question are consistent with the features of a parosteal sarcoma. A paraspinal mass adjacent to L1 with amorphous calcification and strong enhancement on contrast-enhanced sequences suggests a malignant bone-forming tumor, which is typical for parosteal sarcomas. 

Pyogenic abscess (option 1) would usually present with fever and elevated inflammatory markers, and would not typically show calcification. Scheuermann disease (option 2) is a spinal deformity and would not present as a paraspinal mass. Rhabdomyosarcoma (option 3) is a soft tissue tumor and would not typically show calcification.

10826,205045,"A 78-year-old man with a productive cough, fever and malaise undergoes a CXR. He is found to have a lobar pneumonia. What is the most likely responsible organism?",SBA: Cardiothoracic and vascular,Streptococcus,Rhinovirus,Staphylococcus,Mycoplasma,Haemophilus,A,77%,0%,15%,3%,4%,"Explanation:
There is considerable overlap in CXR appearances of pneumonia. Some trends can be seen but ultimately a sputum culture will lead to greater specificity. There are a number of different terms used to describe patterns that can arise.
  Lobar pneumonia
The presence of bacteria in the alveoli causes oedema there. The bronchi are usually spared however; hence the presence of air bronchograms on imaging. The most common cause is streptococcus pneumonia. Klebsiella can also occur and is seen particularly in alcoholic patients or those who may be immunocompromised.
  Bronchopneumonia also known as lobular pneumonia
Inflammation and oedema occurs within both the interstitium and the airways themselves giving a patchy fluffy appearance on a CXR. There is mucus plugging and volume loss (differentiating it from viral pneumonia). It occurs with staphylococcus as well as pneumococcus and klebsiella. Haemophilus would also give this appearance.
  Atypical bacterial pneumonia
Sometimes bacterial infections can give rise to a pneumonia which on a CXR resembles a viral pneumonia. This occurs with mycoplasma, among others.
  Viral pneumonia
Like bronchopneumonia the pathogens affect the airways and interstitium. Air trapping secondary to bronchial constriction occurs which gives rise to hyperinflation (differentiating it from bronchopneumonia). Viral pneumonias are commonly bilateral. Rhinovirus and RSV are common pathogens. Hyperinflation is a reasonably specific finding for viral pneumonias on a CXR. Appearances can be varied however with perihilar fluffy opacities or a more segmental appearance. Pleural effusions occur in around 20% of patients.
  Round pneumonia
This is a specific CXR appearance which occurs in young children. Organisms such as Haemophilus, pneumococcus or streptococcus which are the usual culprits for paediatric pneumonias, are contained by the limited facility for collateral drift; the pores of Kohn have not sufficiently developed to permit spread of the bacteria and consequently the pneumonia is relatively well contained. This gives rise to a rather spherical area, usually within the posterior aspect of the lobes.
  Cavitating pneumonia
Staphylococcus and streptococcus can both cause cavitation. Of the gram negative organisms, klebsiella and Haemophilus can cause cavitation.",TRUE,"Streptococcus is the most likely responsible organism for lobar pneumonia in this age group. This is because Streptococcus pneumoniae is the most common cause of bacterial pneumonia in adults, and it is especially common in the elderly.",2,"This question falls under category 2: A question about clinical judgement, what is the correct diagnosis?",A,TRUE,"I chose option 2, Streptococcus, because Streptococcus pneumoniae is the most common cause of lobar pneumonia, particularly in older adults.

This question examines the differential diagnosis of an elevated hemidaphragm.
Diaphragmatic palsy can be caused by an infarction involving the contralateral internal capsule. This is usually supplied by the middle cerebral artery.
Scoliosis of the spine can take many appearances and the exact effect on the thorax differs from patient to patient.

Which of the following is a benefit of a retrospective study over prospective gated study?,SBA: Cardiothoracic and vascular,Provides functional information,Acquired in multiple axial blocks,Lower radiation dose,Higher resolution images,Less contrast required,A,58%,7%,20%,12%,4%,"Explanation:
Retrospective-gated scanning is helical in nature, not acquired in axial blocks. It gives a higher dose to the patient, as the patient is exposed to radiation throughout the entire cardiac cycle, not just one aspect. This allows matching of images to the cardiac cycle and therefore functional information of both valve and left ventricle can be obtained. The resolution and volume of contrast administered does not change between the two techniques.",FALSE,"I chose number 3 because a retrospective cardiac gated study requires less radiation dose than a prospective gated study. This is because the retrospective study acquires the data in multiple axial blocks, and the data is then combined to create gated images. This method allows for the radiation dose to be spread out over multiple images, resulting in lower radiation dose overall. Additionally, the lower radiation dose of a retrospective study also means that less contrast is required, providing another benefit.",1,"3.

This question falls under 3. A question about clinical decision making, what is the best course of action?",C,TRUE,"I chose this option because a retrospective cardiac gated study has the advantage of providing functional information about the heart.

  Lymphoproliferative disorders include leukaemias, lymphomas, and less aggressive collections of lymphoid tissue. The term is used particularly in head and neck radiology where histological diagnosis of such entities is key. Some masses on a CT scan can have a 'typical' appearance for a lymphoma but are actually only benign lymphoid hyperplastic tissue and thus the term lymphoproliferative disorder covers both entities accurately.
IgG4 related diseases are one of Radiology’s newest entities. They comprise a constellation of fibrotic conditions affecting virtually every part of the body, mediated by a subclass of Immunoglobulin called IgG4.

The presence of a left intraconal lesion in a 45-year-old woman is suggestive of an optic nerve glioma, which is why this is the most likely diagnosis.",2,,A,TRUE,"I chose option 4, optic nerve glioma, as the most likely diagnosis for a left intraconal lesion in a 45-year-old woman's brain. Intraconal lesions are those that occur within the cone-shaped space formed by the extraocular muscles, surrounding the optic nerve. Optic nerve gliomas are tumors that arise from the glial cells of the optic nerve and are commonly found within this intraconal space.

The other options are less likely due to the following reasons:

1. Dermoid: These are benign, slow-growing cystic lesions that typically occur in the orbit but are more commonly found in the extraconal space rather than the intraconal space.

2. Retinoblastoma: This is a rare malignant tumor that originates in the retina, usually in young children. It is not a common diagnosis in a 45-year-old woman.

3. Mucocoele: These are benign, mucus-filled cysts that occur in the paranasal sinuses, not within the intraconal space of the orbit.

Calcium pyrophosphate dehydrate disease (CPPD) also known as pseudogout
CPPD can present in an acute or subacute fashion but is also seen as a chronic cause of joint inflammation. It may be misdiagnosed as simple osteoarthritis owing to its often bilateral and symmetrical distribution but there are also a couple of areas of the body which can be affected in particular, and which would be unusual for isolated degenerative changes.

On examination, the A+E doctor notices he is unusually tall with pectus excavatum deformity and long fingers. An early diastolic murmur is heard on auscultation. He undergoes a CT scan and is found to have an aortic dissection. From where is the dissection most likely to have originated?",SBA: Cardiothoracic and vascular,Aortic root,Just distal to the right subclavian artery,Just proximal to the brachiocephalic artery,At the site of the ligamentum arteriosus,At the level of the diaphragm,A,78%,4%,3%,15%,0%,"Explanation:
The patient has Marfan syndrome which is an autosomal dominant connective tissue disease. Among other common features associated with this condition, the patient in this scenario is tall, with arachnodactyly and pectus excavatum. An early diastolic murmur suggests regurgitation, usually of the aortic valve but less commonly the pulmonary valve. Aortic regurgitation is another feature common to Marfan syndrome but although this may be present it would not necessarily explain his sudden chest pain. Patients with Marfan syndrome are at increased risk of developing aortic dissection compared to the general population.
Dissections are classified according to their involvement of the aortic root and their distal extent. There are two different classification systems. The Stanford classification is more useful clinically since the primary decision post-diagnosis is whether the dissection will be managed surgically or medically. Those involving the proximal aorta and arch are managed surgically. If the arch is not involved, the patient can be managed medically. Thus Stanford A dissections involve the aorta proximal to the origin of the left subclavian artery with or without concurrent distal involvement. Stanford B dissections do not involve the proximal aorta.
Most dissections originate just distal to the aortic valve and extend proximally, ie Stanford type A.
Traumatic aortic rupture is most likely to occur at the site of the ligamentum arteriosus, just distal to the origin of the left subclavian artery. This is termed the aortic isthmus. The proximal aorta is fixed by the ligamentum arteriosus but distal to this point the aorta is more freely mobile.
Coarctation of the aorta is associated with a late systolic or continuous systolic murmur.
Mitral stenosis gives a mid-diastolic murmur.
Rheumatic heart disease can affect any of the heart valves, although most commonly affects the mitral valve causing mitral stenosis.

A CT scan demonstrates a very large multicystic hepatic mass with no evidence of calcification. There is no evidence of any calcification or haemorrhage within the mass. What is the most likely diagnosis?,SBA: Paediatrics,Mesenchymal hamartoma,Neuroblastoma,Hepatocelluar carcinoma,Hepatoblastoma,Haemangioendothelioma,A,66%,3%,1%,15%,15%,"Explanation:
Mesenchymal hamartoma
This is a benign tumour which, if not detected antenatally, usually presents as a large abdominal mass in a neonate (later presentations do occur - 5% patients are >5 years old). Although benign, it's sheer size can cause significant respiratory compromise through diaphragmatic splinting. On imaging the majority of mesenchymal hamartomas are predominantly multicystic with enhancing septations present, but little in the way of added features such as calcification or haemorrhage. There is usually little internal colour doppler flow. AFP may be slightly raised but is usually normal, aiding further the distinction from a hepatoblastoma in particular.
  Haemangioendothelioma
This tumour is often described as causing high output heart failure (e.g. a large heart on CXR) plus a mass in the liver. The aorta proximal to the hepatic branches is usually enlarged. Endothelial growth factor is elevated.
  Hepatoblastoma
This is the most common primary liver tumour in infants under the age of 5. It is associated with Beckwith-Wiedemann Syndrome and prematurity. The serum AFP is elevated in 90% (markedly so) and calcifications are often present. Precocious puberty can be the presenting feature of this tumour.
  Hepatocelluar carcinoma
This is the second most common liver cancer in children. The serum AFP is usually elevated.
  Neuroblastoma
This is not a hepatic tumour but is a cause of a mass adjacent to the liver. It causes stippled calcification with encasement (rather than invasion) of vessels. Bone metastases are common.",FALSE,"Hepatoblastoma is the most likely diagnosis in this case because it is the most common type of liver cancer in children. It is usually found in children under the age of three and typically presents with a large, multicystic hepatic mass with no evidence of calcification or haemorrhage. The absence of a positive AFP and normal endothelial growth factor levels further supports the diagnosis of hepatoblastoma.",2,,D,TRUE,"I chose option 1, Mesenchymal hamartoma, as the most likely diagnosis based on the clinical presentation and imaging findings. 

An 18-month-old patient presenting with abdominal enlargement and respiratory difficulty suggests a large intra-abdominal mass. The negative serum AFP and normal endothelial growth factor levels help to narrow the differential diagnosis. 

The CT scan findings of a very large multicystic hepatic mass without calcification or hemorrhage are characteristic of a mesenchymal hamartoma. Mesenchymal hamartomas are benign liver tumors that typically occur in young children, often presenting with a rapidly enlarging abdominal mass. The multicystic appearance and lack of calcification or hemorrhage in the mass further support this diagnosis.

The other options are less likely due to the following reasons:

2. Neuroblastoma: This is a malignancy of the sympathetic nervous system, typically occurring in the adrenal glands or paraspinal ganglia. It is less likely to present as a multicystic hepatic mass.

3. Hepatocellular carcinoma: This is a malignant liver tumor, more commonly seen in adults with chronic liver disease. It is less likely in an 18-month-old child, and the negative AFP also makes it less likely.

4. Hepatoblastoma: This is the most common malignant liver tumor in children, but it usually presents with an elevated AFP level, which is not the case in this scenario.

5. Haemangioendothelioma: This is a vascular tumor of the liver, and while it can occur in children, it is less likely given the multicystic appearance and normal endothelial growth factor level.",A,FALSE,E

What is the most likely diagnosis?,SBA: Central Nervous and Head & Neck,Colloid cyst,Meningioma,Ependymoma of third ventricle,Cavum veli interpositum cyst,Basilar artery aneurysm,A,89%,2%,6%,1%,1%,"Explanation:
The clinical history of positional headaches and intermittent ataxia is classical for a colloid cyst which can act in a ‘ball + valve’ type mechanism with intermittent CSF obstruction through the third ventricle. The hyperdensity on CT is caused by its proteinaceous content as opposed to calcification, hence it is not seen on bony windows. Of the other answers given a meningioma would need a dural base. Ependymomas are more often found in the paediatric cohort and do not give the intermittent symptoms described here. A cavum veli interpositum cyst are largely asymptomatic normal variants and imaging characteristics would follow CSF. A basilar artery aneurysm is an interesting differential diagnosis here but would not be found in the anatomical location provided.",FALSE,"I chose this answer because ependymomas of the third ventricle are the most common type of tumor found in this location.

11536,205045,You are reviewing an MRI of the prostate. Which of the following best represents the usual findings in prostate cancer?,"SBA: Genito urinary, Adrenal, Obstetrics & Gynaecology and Breast","Low T2, Low ADC, High DWI","High T2, Low ADC, High DWI","High T2, High ADC, High DWI","Low T2, Low ADC, Low DWI","Low T2, High ADC, Low DWI",A,82%,10%,2%,1%,5%,"Explanation:
Prostate cancer
The vast majority of cancers of the prostate are adenocarcinomas and the risk of developing prostate cancer increases with age to such an extent that by the age of 80 approximately 80% of men will have some neoplastic foci within the prostate although these may be completely occult and never manifest clinically. Where the disease does advance it becomes one of the top three most common causes of death from cancer in men alongside lung cancer and colorectal cancer. Serum Prostatic Specific Antigen (PSA) levels have been used in prostate cancer screening since the 1990s.
MRI is crucial to provide accurate staging but is also gaining in momentum on its way to becoming a screening tool in its own right.
The majority of prostate cancers arise from the peripheral zone and causes the normally high T2 signal to become low signal. Additionally the cancer should show restriction in diffusion (ie high signal on DWI, correspondingly low on ADC). It is important to view the T1 images as well in order to exclude the possibility of haemorrhage which can sometimes look like a prostate cancer. The precise appearance of a haemorrhage changes depending on the timeframe.
  DWI + ADC
For a detailed explanation of DWI please use a more robust text than what follows. Readers should be warned that this is a very light glossing over of the concepts only.
Diffusion weighted imaging is the summation of both diffusion and T2 effects. The images must be interpreted in the light of findings on the corresponding ADC map which gives diffusion effects only. The more ‘unrestricted’ the water molecules in a given substance are, the more diffusion takes place during the slice acquisition and the faster the dephasing of the magnetism. There are multiple ADC maps with increasing B-values to see how this dephasing responds. Usually you can pick out a DWI image because the CSF is black (aide memoire ‘Dark Water Imaging’).
Restriction of diffusion is a binary entity – things either restrict or they do not. The things that restrict diffusion are relatively limited in number and you would be well advised to learn them thoroughly for day to day practice as well as for the exams.
Cytotoxic oedema – failure of the cellular membrane ion pumps leads to an increase in intracellular (restricted) water
Acute infarction
As a stroke ages the DWI increases due to the T2 effect and the ADC becomes less bright through shine through. At approximately weeks 1-4 the ADC undergoes pseudonormalisation where restricted diffusion is matched by vasogenic oedema which is not restricted. Chronic infarctions do not restrict diffusion
Hypercellularity – Limiting the ability of extracellular water to diffuse
Some gliomas
Lymphoma
High viscosity
Abscess
Acute demyelination – a complex mechanism involving glutamate
ADEM

T2 shine through – this is a pseudofinding of a bright lesion on the DWI image with a corresponding high signal area on the ADC map.",FALSE,"I chose this option because it is the most typical pattern of findings seen in prostate cancer. High T2 signal intensity indicates increased cellularity and/or increased water content, and low ADC values indicate increased cellularity and/or increased diffusion restriction. High DWI values indicate increased cellularity and/or increased restriction of water diffusion. Together, these findings suggest the presence of prostate cancer.",1,"This question falls under category 1: Basic factual recall, either of basic science, physics, anatomy or regarding a procedure.",C,TRUE,"I chose option 5 (Low T2, Low ADC, High DWI) because these are the typical MRI findings in prostate cancer. 

In prostate cancer, the tumor usually appears as a low signal intensity area on T2-weighted images, which is represented by ""Low T2"" in the options. 

Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps are derived from diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and are used to quantify the movement of water molecules within tissues. In prostate cancer, the movement of water molecules is restricted due to the presence of cancer cells, leading to a lower ADC value (""Low ADC"").

DWI measures the diffusion of water molecules in tissues. In prostate cancer, the diffusion of water molecules is restricted, resulting in a high signal intensity on DWI (""High DWI"").

Therefore, the combination of Low T2, Low ADC, and High DWI best represents the usual findings in prostate cancer.",A,FALSE,C

Necrotising enterocolitis (NEC)
NEC is a very likely diagnosis for a premature infant with pneumatosis. Other findings that point towards NEC are: portal venous gas, focal dilated bowel (i.e. a sentinel loop), featureless bowel and an unchanging bowel gas pattern.

Prematurity
Low birth weight
Congenital heart disease

Perinatal asphyxia
  Biliary atresia is not associated with necrotising enterocolitis but is associated with polysplenia and heterotaxy syndrome.",FALSE,"I chose 4.

14241,205045,A 24-year-old woman sustains a direct facial injury during a cricket match. She is brought to the Emergency Department with extensive facial and orbital injuries and undergoes a CT scan for further evaluation. Which of the following is most specific for a globe rupture? Select ONE answer only.,SBA: Musculoskeletal and Trauma,Flattened posterior segment,Coloboma,Staphyloma,High density in anterior chamber,Shallow anterior chamber,A,66%,4%,3%,13%,15%,"Explanation:
Globe rupture
This injury obviously has the propensity to cause significant long-term morbidity to the patient. Straightforward cases, as seen on a trauma CT, will show significant morphological change to the normal shape of the globe with a large overall reduction in globe volume. In the case of a penetrating mechanism of injury, the presence of a foreign body within the posterior chamber is also diagnostic of a globe rupture. Similarly, the presence of intra-ocular gas also implies a globe rupture.
A more subtle sign of globe rupture paradoxically includes an increase to the depth of the anterior chamber due to posterior displacement of the lens occurring in the context of a posterior segment rupture and subsequent loss of pressure there.
A coloboma is a focal defect in the posterior aspect of the globe with outpouching which can be quite striking in size. This is a congenital defect though, not a post-traumatic one. The finding can be unilateral or bilateral with the latter more suggestive of a syndromic association.
A staphyloma is a broader based defect in the globe, which can be located anywhere. It occurs due to degenerative thinning of the sclera and is seen as a smooth contour irregularity on cross-sectional imaging.",FALSE,"Answer: 5. Shallow anterior chamber. A shallow anterior chamber is a specific sign of a globe rupture, as it indicates that the eye has been damaged, causing the anterior chamber to be filled with fluid, resulting in a shallow chamber. This shallow anterior chamber can be seen on a CT scan, making it the most specific sign of a globe rupture.",2,"3. A question about management and treatment, what is the best course of action?

2. A question about clinical judgement, what is the correct diagnosis?",E,TRUE,"I chose option 2, ""Flattened posterior segment,"" as the most specific for a globe rupture because when the globe of the eye experiences a rupture, the internal pressure decreases, causing the posterior segment to appear flattened on a CT scan.

Which of the following would most accurately describe this situation?,SBA: Gastrointestinal,Femoral hernia,Direct inguinal hernia,Indirect inguinal hernia,Obturator hernia,Spigelian hernia,A,83%,4%,8%,4%,1%,"Explanation:
Abdominal wall hernias
Hernias can occur at any age but are increasingly prevalent with increasing age. Conditions which increase intra-abdominal pressures predispose patients to developing hernias. These might be entities such as constipation or respiratory conditions associated with excess coughing such as COPD.
Hernia

Feature
Femoral
Inferolateral to the pubic tubercle and medial to the femoral vein

Direct inguinal hernias protrude through the conjoint tendon medial to the internal epigastric vessels and enter the scrotal sac through the superficial ring. They pass through the Hesselbach triangle which is composed of the inferior epigastric vessels, rectus abdominus and the inguinal ligament.",FALSE,"I chose this answer because an indirect inguinal hernia is the most common type of hernia to occur in an elderly person. It occurs when part of the small intestine protrudes through a weak spot in the abdominal wall near the inguinal canal. In this case, the herniated loop of small bowel emerges inferolaterally to the left pubic tubercle, which is a typical location for an indirect inguinal hernia.",2,"3.

13651,205045,You are reporting an x-ray of a 35-year-old man which shows a lucent lesion in the tibia. It is metaphyseal but extends into the epiphysis and is eccentrically placed within the bone. There is some expansion but no periosteal reaction. What is the most likely diagnosis?,SBA: Musculoskeletal and Trauma,Giant cell tumour,Intraosseous lipoma,Enchondroma,Malignant fibrous histiocytoma,Osteoblastoma,A,85%,2%,7%,2%,3%,"Explanation:
Giant Cell Tumour also known as osteoclastoma
These are benign bony tumours arising from within bone. They can cause bony expansion from within but not bony scalloping from without. Since they always occur in the mature skeleton they are seldom found in children or adolescent patients although the peak age group is still young; 30s. Typically they occur around the knee but can be found anywhere in the skeleton. They are seen on x-ray as expansile lytic lesions with the words ‘soap bubble’ often used to describe them in literature. On MRI they usually return low signal on both T1 and T2, in contrast to many of the potential differential diagnoses which would otherwise return high signal on one or the other.
  Four criteria of GCT (according to Clyde A. Helms)
After epiphyseal closure
Abuts articular surface
Well defined, non-sclerotic margin
Eccentric location
  Intraosseous lipoma
These benign lesions can present with pain but around a third of cases are diagnosed incidentally. The classic location for them is the calcaneum but they do occur all around the body. On x-ray they appear as a lucent bone lesion with a thin cortex and no periosteal reaction. Some show dystrophic calcifications. On MRI signal characteristics follow fat with high signal on T1 and signal loss on fat suppression sequences. The presence of granulation tissue can give high signal and calcifications, if present, will return low signal. On CT the fat within the lesion will show low/negative Hounsfield units.

  Enchondroma
As the name suggests, this is a cartilage forming tumour showing ground-glass matrix and ring or arc calcifications (as with all cartilage forming tumours). Patients are typically young (10-30 years) and the lesions are typically found in the hands (although they can form anywhere in the body. In the hands they are unusual to be found in the terminal phalanges). They are thought to derive from ongoing growth of small foci of cartilage which have become displaced from the growth plate. They can expand the cortex but, unless presenting as a fracture, should be painless and therefore are often an incidental diagnosis. Although they are benign tumours, malignant degeneration to a chondrosarcoma can occur.

  Malignant fibrous histiocytoma (MFH) - this is now known as undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma
A soft-tissue MFH is the most common subtype of MFHs and the most common malignant primary soft tissue tumour in the over 50s age bracket. It usually presents as a painless soft tissue mass which enlarges over a matter of months. They can be large at the time of diagnosis measuring tens of centimetres. On x-ray they appear as a partly calcified soft tissue mass. Cortical erosion of the underlying bone is an important diagnostic feature. 
  Osteoid osteoma
These are small benign tumours but which can be quite symptomatic, classically with pain relieved by aspirin. The majority form in the diaphyses of long bones but the posterior elements of the spine is another classic location.
The radiolucent nidus and symptoms of night pain in a young patient point to either an osteoid osteoma or an osteoblastoma. The final diagnosis comes down to size: <1.5 cm is definitely an osteoid osteoma, and >2 cm is definitely an osteoblastoma. There is a nasty grey area somewhere between the two sizes.
On x-ray the radiolucent nidus may not be fully appreciated, and the abnormality which is picked up will be the consequential sclerotic solid periosteal reaction. In the spine there may be a painful scoliosis concave towards the lesion as a result of adjacent muscular spasm. CT is used to confirm the diagnosis as the nidus is readily appreciable.

8856,205045,A 45-year-old man who previously had a splenectomy following a road traffic incident is being followed up. His latest CT shows features consistent with splenosis. What would be the most sensitive test to confirm this finding?,SBA: Gastrointestinal,Labelled RBC Scan,Labelled WC Scan,MRI,Triple phase CT,USS,A,85%,12%,1%,2%,1%,"Explanation:
During this scan the patient is injected with stannous phosphate which enters the red blood cells and primes them for labelling with technetium. After 20 minutes, 20 ml of blood is taken out and combined with Tc99m pertechnetate. The blood is then heated to around 50oC for 35mins and then re-injected. The red blood cells damaged by this process are filtered out of the circulation by any normally functioning splenic tissue within the body.
Absence of uptake on imaging is consistent with asplenia.
An alternative scan which can also be performed is a Tc99m sulphur colloid scan.
  Splenosis
When there has been trauma to the spleen, tiny fragments can migrate around the peritoneal cavity, attach to structures and grow into larger collections of splenic tissue. On imaging these behave exactly as you would expect the normal spleen to for each modality. They can cause confusion if they are mistaken for peritoneal deposits.",FALSE,"Triple phase CT is the most sensitive test to confirm the presence of splenosis because it can provide detailed images of the splenic tissue, which can then be compared to the patient's medical history and previous imaging results. This allows for the most accurate diagnosis of splenosis. Furthermore, triple phase CT can reveal the presence of any other abnormalities in the abdomen that may be related to the splenosis.",2,"3. A question about clinical management, what is the best course of action?

This question falls under question 2: A question about clinical judgement, what is the correct diagnosis?",D,TRUE,"I chose option 1, the labelled RBC (red blood cell) scan, because it is the most sensitive test to confirm splenosis. Splenosis is a condition where small nodules of splenic tissue are found in various locations throughout the body, usually following a splenectomy or trauma to the spleen. These nodules can sometimes be mistaken for other conditions, such as tumors.

A labelled RBC scan, also known as a Tc-99m-labelled heat-damaged red blood cell (RBC) scintigraphy, is a sensitive and specific test for identifying ectopic splenic tissue. In this test, the patient's own red blood cells are labelled with a radioactive tracer (technetium-99m) and then re-infused into the patient. The labelled RBCs are preferentially taken up by the ectopic splenic tissue, allowing for the identification of splenosis on imaging.

Other tests, such as labelled white cell scan, MRI, triple phase CT, and ultrasound, can also be used to evaluate splenosis but may not be as sensitive or specific as the labelled RBC scan in confirming the diagnosis.",A,TRUE,A

Select ONE answer only.,SBA: Cardiothoracic and vascular,Bilateral ground glass opacification with air trapping,Tree-in-bud changes and bronchiectasis in the right middle lobe,Upper lobe predominant tree-in-bud changes,Perilymphatic nodules and interlobular septal thickening,Perihilar opacification with pleural effusions,A,78%,8%,7%,5%,2%,"Explanation:
Bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome
There are two very similarly named syndromes which are completely different in aetiology  but frequently confused.
BOOP – bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia. This is the old term for what is now referred to as COP (Cryptogenic organizing pneumonia). There is patchy consolidation and ground glass opacification.
BOS – bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome. This is part of a CLAD (chronic lung allograft dysfunction).
In CLAD, a transplanted lung is not being rejected (another common misnomer) but the graft is undergoing fibrosis which causes respiratory dysfunction. The findings on CT, in the case of BOS, include mosaic attenuation with air trapping, bronchial wall thickening and bronchiectasis.
Post-transplant complications
The radiology of post-transplant lungs may be niche but it is important, particularly in the early post-operative days. Post-transplant complications can be, in an exam question setting at least, alluded to on the basis of their time frame.
  Time Complication Key CT findings (others may be present)
Hours Hyperacute rejection Unlikely to undergo CT
4-24 hours Reperfusion injury Perihilar (Batwing) opacification with small effusions
7-10 days Acute rejection Septal thickening with effusions
Weeks Drug toxicity Ground glass opacification

Perilymphatic nodules and interlobular septal thickening - Sarcoidosis
Perihilar opacification with pleural effusions - Pulmonary oedema",FALSE,"Upper lobe predominant tree-in-bud changes are the most common findings seen in bronchiolitis obliterans. This is because the disease tends to affect the small airways first, which are located in the upper lobes of the lungs.

A question about the interpretation of a test result?

2. A question about clinical judgement, what is the correct diagnosis?",A,TRUE,"I chose option 1, ""Bilateral ground glass opacification with air trapping,"" because it best describes the typical findings of bronchiolitis obliterans on high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT). Bronchiolitis obliterans is a known complication of lung transplantation and is characterized by inflammation and fibrosis of the small airways, leading to their obstruction.

The ground glass opacification represents areas of inflammation and fibrosis, while air trapping is a result of the obstruction of small airways, causing air to be retained in the affected lung regions. The other options do not accurately describe the imaging findings associated with bronchiolitis obliterans.",A,FALSE,E
9481,205045,A 20-year-old woman who has spent much of the last three months lying in a body cast having sustained a spinal fracture during a road traffic incident develops intermittent abdominal pain and vomiting relieved by lying prone. You are asked to perform a barium follow-through study and this shows a vertical band-like narrowing at D3. Proximal to this point the duodenum is dilated and there is vigorous to and fro peristalsis. What is the most likely diagnosis?,SBA: Gastrointestinal,SMA syndrome,Ladd bands,Annular pancreas,Duodenal duplication cyst,Duodenal atresia,A,71%,24%,3%,1%,1%,"Explanation:
SMA syndrome
Vascular compression of the duodenum between the aorta and the SMA can be seen on a barium study. Dilatation proximal to the D3 segment is classical, as is the vigorous to and fro peristalsis within the proximal duodenum. Patients experience abdominal pain and vomiting, with symptoms being relieved by lying prone. Purportedly an angles of 10-20o between the SMA and aorta can cause this syndrome, with the normal angle being around 50o. There are a number of conditions which predispose to this syndrome, including: pregnancy, prolonged bed rest, and extensive weight loss.
  Ladd bands
Ladd bands are congenital peritoneal bands of fibrous tissues which join the (abnormally positioned) caecum to the liver, crossing the duodenum as they do so. They may not always cause problems but duodenal compression symptoms may arise. They can also be the root cause of a small bowel volvulus or internal hernia.
  Duodenal duplication cyst
Around quarter of duplication cysts occur in each of the ileum, oesophagus and colon (of these the ileum is the most common). The remaining quarter includes the stomach, jejunum and duodenum. A barium study may show a filling defect reminiscent of an extrinsic mass and if it is visible on ultrasound it would appear as a rounded or tubular cystic mass. For the most part however the diagnosis can be made on CT or MRI. The thin wall of the cyst may enhance slightly on CT and on MRI they will return high T2 signal, much as would be expected from a cystic structure.
  Annular pancreas
When the head and uncinate process of the pancreas (ventral pancreas) fail to migrate satisfactorily during embryological development they can fuse with the rest of the pancreas and encircle the duodenum. Around half of patients are diagnosed in childhood although the condition can remain asymptomatic and be picked up incidentally. In the neonatal period symptoms fit with duodenal obstruction and the classic ‘double bubble’ can be seen on fluoroscopy where contrast media can flow through the pylorus into the D1 segment of the duodenum but no further. Most cases are associated with other congenital abnormalities such as trache-oesophageal fistula, malrotation or atresia of the duodenum or oesophagus and Down syndrome (i.e. single palmar crease, Brushfield spots) is also an associated syndrome.
  Duodenal atresia
This should be considered as a diagnosis in any young baby with upper GI symptoms. The x-ray will show no gas in the distal bowel but, counterintuitively, there is often aerobilia if the Sphincter of Oddi is proximal to the atrophic part. When there is air in both the stomach and proximal duodenum on an x-ray it is referred to as the double-bubble sign. There is a reasonably strong association with Down syndrome: around a quarter of cases of duodenal atresia will have Down syndrome.",FALSE,"Ladd bands are the most likely diagnosis in this case. They are bands of fibrous tissue that form between the duodenum and the mesentery, the tissue that attaches the small intestine to the abdominal wall. These bands can cause obstruction, leading to abdominal pain and vomiting. The barium follow-through study would show a vertical band-like narrowing at D3, indicating the presence of Ladd bands. Proximal to this point, the duodenum would be dilated and there would be vigorous to and fro peristalsis, which are both common signs of Ladd bands.",2,,B,TRUE,"I chose option 4, SMA (Superior Mesenteric Artery) syndrome, because the clinical scenario and radiological findings are consistent with this diagnosis. The patient has been in a body cast for an extended period, which could lead to significant weight loss and a decrease in the fat pad surrounding the SMA. This can result in compression of the third part of the duodenum (D3) between the SMA and the aorta, causing the vertical band-like narrowing seen on the barium follow-through study. Additionally, the patient's symptoms of abdominal pain and vomiting relieved by lying prone are classic for SMA syndrome, as this position can help alleviate the compression. The presence of a dilated duodenum proximal to the narrowing and vigorous to and fro peristalsis further supports this diagnosis.",A,TRUE,A

  Lymphoproliferative disorders include leukaemias, lymphomas, and less aggressive collections of lymphoid tissue. The term is used particularly in head and neck radiology where histological diagnosis of such entities is key. Some masses on a CT scan can have a 'typical' appearance for a lymphoma but are actually only benign lymphoid hyperplastic tissue and thus the term lymphoproliferative disorder covers both entities accurately.
IgG4 related diseases are one of Radiology’s newest entities. They comprise a constellation of fibrotic conditions affecting virtually every part of the body, mediated by a subclass of Immunoglobulin called IgG4. Where one condition exists others may also be present. The more common of these include:
Orbital pseudotumour
Fibrosing mediastinitis
Reidel thyroiditis
Autoimmune pancreatitis
Sclerosing mesenteritis
Retroperitoneal fibrosis",FALSE,"I chose haemangioma as the most likely diagnosis because it is the most common type of benign tumor found in the brain. Haemangiomas are typically found in the extra-axial space, which is the space between the brain and the skull, making it the most likely diagnosis for a left extraconal lesion. Additionally, haemangiomas occur more commonly in adults than in children, making it a more likely diagnosis for a 45-year-old woman than the other choices.",2,,B,FALSE,"I chose option 1, Haemangioma, as the most likely diagnosis for a left extraconal lesion in a 45-year-old woman's brain because:

1. Haemangiomas are benign vascular tumors that can occur in the orbit (eye socket) and are more common in middle-aged adults. The extraconal location of the lesion supports the possibility of a haemangioma.

2. Retinoblastoma (option 2) is a rare malignant tumor of the retina, typically affecting young children, not middle-aged adults.

3. Optic nerve glioma (option 3) is a rare tumor that arises from the optic nerve, which is usually an intraconal lesion. It is also more common in children and young adults.

4. Sarcoidosis (option 4) is a multisystem inflammatory disease that can involve the eyes, but it typically presents with intraocular inflammation and granulomatous uveitis, not an extraconal lesion.

5. Rhabdomyosarcoma (option 5) is a malignant tumor of skeletal muscle origin that can occur in the orbit. However, it is more common in children and adolescents.

It is large but smooth with a lobulated border and no evidence of invasion. There are small foci of calcification. The lateral ventricle is dilated. On MRI there is isointensity on T1 and hyperintensity on T2 relative to the white matter, with punctate foci of T2 hypointensity. What is the most likely diagnosis?",SBA: Paediatrics,Choroid plexus papilloma,Ependymoma,Metastasis,Cavernous angioma,Astrocytoma,A,85%,8%,0%,4%,2%,"Explanation:
This is a classical description for this tumour. Although predominantly a tumour of childhood situated in the lateral ventricles, when it does occur in adults it tends to be in the 4th ventricle. The overproduction of CSF by these tumours causes communicating hydrocephalus, hence ventricular dilatation and the symptom of uncontrollable crying with vomiting.
Ependymomas also occur in the paediatric cohort and are almost like an opposite to the choroid plexus papilloma in that ependymomas in children predominate in the 4th ventricle, show T1 hypointensity with foci of high T2 signal. They are the ‘toothpaste’ tumour, expanding out through the foramina of Magendie and Luschka.
  Cavernous angiomas are classically described as having a popcorn appearance with a low T2 haemosiderin rim.",FALSE,"The most likely diagnosis is ependymoma. This is based on the imaging findings, which show a hyperdense mass with intense homogeneous enhancement, a smooth border, and small foci of calcification. These characteristics are typical of ependymomas. Additionally, ependymomas are more common in this age group than other brain tumors.",2,,B,TRUE,"I chose Choroid Plexus Papilloma as the most likely diagnosis based on the provided clinical and imaging findings. Here's a brief explanation of the findings and their correlation with the diagnosis:

1. Location: The mass is in the trigone of the left lateral ventricle, which is a common location for choroid plexus papillomas. These tumors arise from the choroid plexus epithelium.

2. Imaging characteristics on CT: The hyperdense mass with intense homogeneous enhancement, smooth and lobulated border, and small foci of calcification are typical features of choroid plexus papillomas.

3. Imaging characteristics on MRI: Isointensity on T1 and hyperintensity on T2 relative to the white matter, along with punctate foci of T2 hypointensity, are consistent with the diagnosis of choroid plexus papilloma.

4. Age of the patient: Choroid plexus papillomas are more common in children, especially in infants and young children under the age of 2 years.

5. Clinical presentation: Uncontrollable crying and vomiting in a 7-month-old patient may be related to increased intracranial pressure due to the mass effect and associated ventricular dilation.

Given these findings and the patient's age, choroid plexus papilloma is the most likely diagnosis. Other options, such as ependymoma, metastasis, cavernous angioma, and astrocytoma, do not fit the imaging and clinical characteristics as well as choroid plexus papilloma does.",A,TRUE,A
11376,205045,Which of the following nuclear medicine agents should not be used in patients with renal failure? Select one answer only.,"SBA: Genito urinary, Adrenal, Obstetrics & Gynaecology and Breast",DTPA,DMSA,MAG3,MAG4,DMTA,A,62%,12%,14%,4%,8%,"Explanation:
Nuclear medicine comes into its own with renal medicine. There are various different options for various different scenarios.
  MAG3
Dynamic scan. Images every 2 mins for approximately 20 mins
MAG3 is a compound which has a high renal extraction rate and can be labelled with Tc99m. It provides an overview of the renal plasma flow. A normal unobstructed shows an initial increase in activity over 2 minutes as the tracer reaches the kidney followed by a slow decline in activity over around 20 minutes as it is filtered. An obstructed system will show a similar initial increase but activity will then not decline. Furosemide can be given to maximise the opportunity to show flow distal to the kidney. MAG3 is a safe agent to use in patients with renal failure.
  Captopril (an ACEi) can be given to diagnose renal artery stenosis as a cause of hypertension since the activity in a patient with renal artery stenosis will decline following administration of Captopril whereas a normal kidney will retain activity.
  Post-micturition images at 20 minutes can help to show the presence of residual bladder volume.
  DTPA – differential agent
Dynamic scan. Images at 1.5 second intervals for the first 30 seconds then less at 5 min intervals for 30 mins
Since DTPA is cleared only via the glomeruli it can be used to measure GFR. In a normal kidney the activity level peaks sharply followed by a decline which is initially rapid and then tapers off. As GFR worsens firstly the initial rapid decline becomes more gradual and with increasingly poor disease the initial peak then becomes diminished too. Ironically for a study used to measure GFR, DTPA is not a good agent for patients with renal failure; it can only be cleared via the glomeruli therefore if there is no glomerular filtration the agent will persist and lead to a high dose. Studies need higher doses than MAG3.
  DMSA – morphology and structure
Static scan. Image once at 2 hours.
DMSA is an excellent agent for evaluating the renal cortex. It is used a lot in the paediatric setting in the investigation of scars following pyelonephritis.",FALSE,"MAG4 is a nuclear medicine agent that should not be used in patients with renal failure because it can cause further damage to the kidneys. MAG4 is a radiopharmaceutical that is used to measure the glomerular filtration rate, which can be impaired in patients with renal failure. The use of MAG4 in these patients can lead to further kidney damage due to the accumulation of radioactive material in the kidneys.",1,"This question falls under category 1: Basic factual recall, either of basic science, physics, anatomy or regarding a procedure.",D,FALSE,"I chose DMSA (Dimercaptosuccinic acid) because it is a nuclear medicine agent that is primarily eliminated through the kidneys.

Additionally, the diagnostic accuracy of DMSA scans may be compromised in patients with renal failure due to the altered biodistribution of the tracer. For these reasons, DMSA is generally not recommended for use in patients with renal failure.",B,FALSE,B
11531,205045,A 64-year-old woman who is known to have had type 2 diabetes mellitus for many years is being investigated for recurrent urinary tract infections. A mid-stream urine specimen shows microscopic haematuria and she goes on to have a cystoscopy. At cystoscopy there are multiple bladder lesions measuring between 3-9mm in diameter which appear slightly raised from the mucosa and yellowish in colour. The findings are mirrored on an IVU which also shows filling defects in the distal right ureter. What is the most likely diagnosis?,"SBA: Genito urinary, Adrenal, Obstetrics & Gynaecology and Breast",Malakoplakia,Tuberculosis,Xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis,Leukoplakia,Schistosomiasis,A,76%,1%,5%,17%,2%,"Explanation:
Malakoplakia
Directly translated from Greek, malakoplakia just means soft plaques. These are actually submucosal inflammatory plaques consisting of basophilic PAS positive inclusion bodies and incompletely destroyed e-coli bacteria. The giveaway pathological term is Michaelis-Gutmann inclusion bodies which are the incompletely destroyed e-coli bacteria surrounded by a lipoprotein membrane. Although malakoplakia can occur in anyone, patients with diabetes mellitus or immunosuppression are predisposed to it. Importantly though, it is not a pre-malignant condition unlike leukoplakia. On imaging there are filling defects in the bladder and distal ureters. These are usually small, measuring only a few millimetres across.
  Xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis (XGP)
This curious condition results from chronic pyelonephritis and leads to a non-functioning kidney. Chronic infection (most commonly with Proteus or e-coli) induces a granulomatous process whereby the renal tissue eventually becomes replaced by a mass of reactive tissue. Since proteus infection is one of the main causes it is not surprising that many cases present with a staghorn calculus. The exact association varies from 30-90% depending on the data source. The other finding on CT is of multiple low attenuation rounded areas with Hounsfield Units (HU) of around -15 to -20. These are the dilated calyces filled with debris and xanthoma collections and they cause the whole kidney to be enlarged. The appearance is said to resemble a bear’s paw. Patients can present either on a background of recurrent UTIs or potentially renal colic. Vague malaise and weight loss may be the presentation in the absence of direct urinary symptoms.
  Schistosomiasis
Schistosome larvae burrow through human skin and travel via the lymphatics to the lungs and liver to mature. Thence they continue onto the pelvic vessels where eggs are deposited in the bladder wall. There the eggs cause both a granulomatous and an inflammatory reaction which erodes through the bladder mucosa and the eggs are then excreted in the urine. The disease is endemic to many parts of Africa.
The dominant imaging feature is of bladder wall calcification. This is usually described as curvilinear or floccular and involves all of the layers of the bladder. Owing to the chronic fibrotic reaction the bladder eventually becomes restricted and small; thus the standout imaging feature is of a small calcified bladder. The main differential diagnosis of bladder wall calcification is tuberculosis.
Another important facet to these cases is the risk of bladder cancer developing in the context of chronic inflammation. These cancers are squamous cell carcinomas and should be actively looked for in cases of schistosomiasis; there is a latent period of approximately 20 years prior to development.
  Renal tuberculosis
In areas of the world endemic to tuberculosis, renal tuberculosis is a reasonably common presentation of extra-pulmonary disease. The appearances on imaging vary depending on the disease timeline. The classical ‘putty kidney’ of renal tuberculosis is an end-stage appearance where there is dystrophic calcification affecting all parts of the kidney. At this point the kidney has usually become shrunken and small and the final appearance is of so-called autonephrectomy when there is essentially no parenchymal tissue left, just amorphous calcification. An earlier manifestation is stenosis to the infundibuli connecting the calyces to the renal pelvis causing proximal dilatation of the calyces which are seen to be clubbed on a urogram. Purportedly, the earliest sign is of moth-eaten calyces owing to uneven erosion to the papillae.
  Leukoplakia 
Directly translated from Greek, leukoplakia just means white plaques. It is a squamous metaplastic condition affecting the transitional cell epithelium of the bladder. Presentation is usually as a consequence either of recurrent urinary tract infections or urinary tract calculi. Sometimes patients complain of passing flaky white tissue in the urine which is pathognomonic for this condition. On imaging there is mucosal thickening and filling defects within the bladder. Some sources consider leukoplakia to be a premalignant condition for epidermoid carcinoma.",FALSE,"I chose 3. Xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis because it is a condition characterized by the presence of multiple bladder lesions that appear slightly raised from the mucosa and yellowish in colour.

11051,205045,"A 38-year-old teacher with a non-productive cough, dyspnoea and low grade pyrexia undergoes a CT scan which shows peripheral patchy consolidation with a reverse halo appearance. What is the most likely diagnosis?",SBA: Cardiothoracic and vascular,Cryptogenic organizing pneumonia,Wegener granulomatosis,Sarcoidosis,Lipoid pneumonitis,Tuberculosis,A,80%,10%,4%,4%,2%,"Explanation:
Cryptogenic organizing pneumonia (COP) also known as Bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP)
COP is seen in patients post-infection, post-transplant, with a drug toxicity (chemo or methotrexate among others) or in an idiopathic setting. Patients experience a flu-like illness and a dry cough with worsening dyspnoea dating back over the preceding few months. Patients are often treated initially as a bacterial pneumonia and unsurprisingly there is then no response to antibiotic therapy. On CT there is patchy consolidation or ground glass opacification (GGO) and a third of patients will have pleural effusions or lymph node enlargement.
The reverse halo appearance is synonymous with COP (also known as BOOP – Bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia). It is seen as central ground glass opacification surrounded by a ring of consolidation. There are other conditions which can cause this appearance, of which the prominent ones are:
Wegeners granulomatosis
Sarcoidosis
Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia
    The halo sign
The halo sign is seen when there is a central nodule surrounded by ground glass opacification. It is almost as synonymous with invasive aspergillosis but is also seen in:
Other fungal infections
Septic emboli
TB
Hemorrhagic metastasis
Minimally invasive adenocarcinoma of the lung (Bronchioalveolar carcinoma)
Hypersensitivity pneumonitis
Wegeners granulomatosis",TRUE,"Cryptogenic organizing pneumonia is the most likely diagnosis based on the CT scan findings. The reverse halo appearance is a characteristic of this condition, which is caused by the accumulation of inflammatory cells and fibrin in the alveoli.

The patient's symptoms of non-productive cough, dyspnea, and low-grade pyrexia are common in Cryptogenic Organizing Pneumonia (COP). Additionally, the CT scan showing peripheral patchy consolidation with a reverse halo appearance is a characteristic finding in COP. The reverse halo sign, also known as the atoll sign, is seen as a central ground-glass opacity surrounded by a denser consolidation ring, which is a typical feature in organizing pneumonia.

Select ONE answer only.,SBA: Central Nervous and Head & Neck,The head of the malleus is situated in the epitympanum,The short crus of the incus is situated in the mesotympanum,The Prussak space is found behind the inferior part of the tympanic membrane,The Eustachian tube opens into the mesotympanum,The stapes is connected to the malleus,A,66%,11%,6%,11%,5%,"Explanation:
The anatomy of the middle ear is complex but important and contains a number of specific anatomical terms.
  Image © Medical Exam Prep
  The epitympanum, also known as the attic, is the superior portion above the highest point of the tympanic membrane. It contains the head of the malleus and the short crus of the incus (These give the appearance of an ice-cream cone on an axial CT).
  Image © Medical Exam Prep
  The Prussak space is found within the epitympanum and is a tiny space at the top of the tympanic membrane, just behind the scutum. Its clinical relevance is that it is the usual origin for pars flaccida cholesteatomas.
The aditus ad antrum connects the epitympanum to the mastoid antrum and thence the mastoid air cells.
The tegmen mastoidium (tegmen means roof) is the point at which the mastoid air cells meet the temporal lobe of the brain.
The tegmen tympani is the point at which the upper most extent of the epitympanum reaches the temporal lobe of the brain.
    Image © Medical Exam Prep
  The mesotympanum is the space posterior to the tympanic membrane and contains the body of the incus, the manubrium (connected to the tympanic membrane) and the anterior process of the malleus and the stapes. The stapes is connected to the incus as well as the oval window of the cochlea. There is also a round window placed more inferiorly which bulges to allow compression waves transmitted from the stapes to the oval window to travel through the cochlea.
The hypotympanum is a far less significant space than either the epitympanum or the mesotympanum. It begins at the inferior most extent of the tympanic membrane. The Eustachian tube opens into the hypotympanum anteriorly.",TRUE,"I chose this answer because it is correct according to anatomy. The head of the malleus is situated in the epitympanum, which is the middle ear cavity located between the tympanic membrane and the inner ear.

9041,205045,A 19-year-old woman complains of vague upper abdominal pain. She is initially managed conservatively but re-presents with the same complaint after a few weeks and an ultrasound scan is requested by her GP. This shows numerous cystic structures which converge on the porta hepatis and appear to be in communication with the bile ducts. The common bile duct is normal in calibre. What would be the most likely diagnosis?,SBA: Gastrointestinal,Caroli disease,Sclerosing cholangitis,Primary biliary cirrhosis,Cholecystitis,Cholangiocarcinoma,A,89%,4%,6%,1%,1%,"Explanation:
Choledochal cyst
Reflux of pancreatic enzymes into the common bile duct  leads to weakening of the wall of the common bile duct [CBD] (+/- the common hepatic duct) and thereafter aneurysmal dilatation termed a choledochal cyst. There are five different subtypes. Patients are mostly diagnosed in childhood.  If undiagnosed to adulthood patients present with a triad of episodic jaundice, right upper quadrant pain and a right upper quadrant mass.
Type I – This is by far the most common version. The common bile duct is affected either focally or along its entire length.
Type II – A true diverticulum of the CBD
Type III – Focal dilatation of the CBD contained within the wall of the duodenum. This type is also called a choledochocoele. They present slightly later with most patients being in their 30s at the time of diagnosis and can be seen as a duodenal filling defect on barium follow-through studies.
Type IV – The intrahepatic and extrahepatic biliary ducts are affected
Type V – The intraheptic ducts are affected alone. This is termed Caroli disease however there is some discrepancy in the literature as to whether this can be called a type V choledochal cyst or whether it is a separate disease in its own right. Caroli disease (cavernous ectasia of the intrahepatic ducts) can be inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion. When present it is quite striking on imaging with saccular dilatation of most of the larger intrahepatic biliary ducts alongside focal strictures giving a beaded appearance. There is an association with medullary sponge kidney and patients are at significantly increased risk of developing cholangiocarcinoma.
  Cholecystitis
When a gallstone becomes lodged in the neck of the gallbladder, chemical irritation from the trapped bile leads to inflammation of the gallbladder. Sometimes this can be felt by the patient as shoulder pain since irritation of the gallbladder is felt via C3, 4 and 5 the dermatomes of which cover the shoulder. Mostly, however, patients complain of right upper quadrant pain. With an accurate history this should be distinguishable from the pain caused by biliary colic, the latter being intermittent in nature and lasting less than six hours per episode.
On ultrasound the earliest signs will be of gallstones in the presence of a sonographic Murphy sign. Clinically Murphy sign is maximal tenderness when palpating over the gallbladder and the addition of ultrasound allows for greater specificity in this regard. The presence of pericholecystic fluid and increasing thickness of the gallbladder wall (>3mm) are also common findings, but come slightly later on. With CT similar findings can be seen with the addition of enhancement of the adjacent liver due to reactive hyperaemia. The presence of gallstones can be easily masked on CT since they are often of equal density to the bile.
Nuclear medicine tests would not usually be part of the index management of cholecystitis however can be used to determine cytic duct patency. Non-visualisation of the gallbladder at four hours following injection of 99mTc-HIDA is reported to be 99% specific in the diagnosis of cholecystitis.
Acalculous cholecystitis can also occur, often in the setting of an already unwell patient on ITU. It will present as generic sepsis and it is usually down to the clinical team to retain a high index of suspicioun. It is thought to be a consequence of low blood flow in the cystic artery.
Emphysematous cholecystitis signifies a gas-producing organism such as Clostridium or E-coli. Appearances are striking on imaging with ring-down or reverberation artefacts on ultrasound and mural gas seen on CT. Patients are typically (but not exclusively) diabetic or suffering from a debilitating condition. Unfortunately the mortality rate is significantly higher than for non-emphysematous cholecystitis.
Mirizzi syndrome can present as cholecystitis and occurs when the common hepatic duct is obstructed by the mechanical pressure of a stone within the cystic duct. It follows that patients whose cystic duct happens to insert low in the course of the common hepatic duct are predisposed to this condition.
  Cholangiocarcinoma
Any disease which causes chronic biliary inflammation predisposes the patient to developing cholangiocarcinoma, a malignancy of the biliary tree. In particular, inflammatory bowel disease poses a 10 times greater risk. Painless jaundice is the presenting feature in around one in ten patients but mostly patients present more insidiously with abdominal pain or weight loss.
Cholangiocarcinomas can be intra or extrahepatic and a few of the pertinent features of each are listed in the table below.
                   Extrahepatic                  
Intrahepatic
90% (Right > left)
10%
Fluctuating painless jaundice
Painful or painless jaundice, weight loss
Ductal strictures
Satellite nodules
  A Klatskin tumour is an intrahepatic tumour arising at the confluence of the left and right hepatic ducts where they join to form the common hepatic duct. Consequently it obstructs both ducts separately. On MRCP or ERCP this is seen as duct dilatation where the left and right ducts fail to communicate with one another. The location is relevant in identifying this type of tumours since they tend to be aggressive in nature, even for cholangiocarcinomas.
On ultrasound a cholangiocarcinoma can have a variable appearance. Duct dilatation, if present, should be evident. On CT the tumour will be hypodense but can show early rim enhancement with contrast, followed by filling-in leading to homogeneous delayed enhancement by around 15minutes. Thereafter there is washout which, again, begins peripherally. Appearances therefore depend hugely on the phase of the scan. Since cholangiocarcinomas do not derive from hepatocytes they do not take up sulphur colloid and thus will appear cold on a sulphur colloid scan.
  Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC)
Although benign in nature PSC can wreak havoc for patients unfortunate enough to develop it. It is twice as common in men as in women and 70% of patients have a history of inflammatory bowel disease. Bile duct strictures form (particularly at the bifurcation/confluence of ducts) and lead to an obstructive jaundice picture. In between strictures there is dilatation and the combination of the two leads to a string of beads type appearance. The appearance on ERCP or MRCP in some patients can also resemble a tree in winter with pruning of the upstream branches. Outpouchings also form which are either true or pseudo-diverticulae. Hepatic atrophy is present in chronic cases, although the caudate lobe is usually spared. Patients unfortunately have a higher risk of developing cholangiocarcinoma.
  Primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC)
This can be difficult to distinguish from PSC however whereas PSC can involve both intra and extrahepatic ducts, PBC only involves the intrahepatic ducts. It is an autoimmune condition and, like many other autoimmune conditions, patients are typically women in their middle ages. Antimitochondrial antibodies (AMA) are present in the vast majority of patients. On imaging, the secondary cirrhotic effects are most pertinent with caudate lobe hypertrophy and left lobar atrophy. The periportal halo sign as seen on MRI is reasonably specific and relates to fluid accumulation around the portal triad.
 ",TRUE,"Caroli disease is a rare congenital disorder that is characterized by cystic dilations of the intrahepatic bile ducts. The cystic structures seen on the ultrasound scan, which converge on the porta hepatis and appear to be in communication with the bile ducts, are consistent with the findings of Caroli disease. Primary biliary cirrhosis, sclerosing cholangitis, cholecystitis, and cholangiocarcinoma are not likely to be the cause of the woman's symptoms based on the ultrasound findings.",2,,C,TRUE,"I chose option 1, Caroli disease, because the clinical presentation and ultrasound findings are consistent with this diagnosis. Caroli disease is a rare congenital disorder characterized by multiple cystic dilatations of the intrahepatic bile ducts. The ultrasound findings mentioned in the question, such as numerous cystic structures converging on the porta hepatis and appearing to be in communication with the bile ducts, are typical features of Caroli disease. The normal calibre of the common bile duct further supports this diagnosis.

The other options are less likely due to the following reasons:

2. Sclerosing cholangitis: This condition typically presents with thickening and narrowing of the bile ducts, which is not consistent with the ultrasound findings in this case.

3. Primary biliary cirrhosis: This is an autoimmune disease that affects the small bile ducts in the liver and would not cause the cystic structures seen in the ultrasound.

4. Cholecystitis: This refers to inflammation of the gallbladder, which is not consistent with the described ultrasound findings of cystic structures in the liver.

5. Cholangiocarcinoma: This is a malignancy of the bile ducts and would typically present with a solid mass rather than multiple cystic structures.",A,FALSE,FALSE

Please note that the question asks which statement is NOT correct.
  Heterotaxy
There are two main forms of this congenital disorder:
Left sided isomerism (polysplenia)
Things that would usually be found on the left side are duplicated on the right side too. The most consistent features are the abnormalities of the spleen and IVC. The other features are commonly associated, but variably seen. The prognosis is slightly better than for asplenia syndrome as there is a lower association with congenital heart disease. There is still 75% mortality by age 5 though.
Spleen - multiple little spleens
IVC - interrupted IVC with azygos or hemiazygos continuation
Lung lobes - two on either side
Liver - situated centrally in the abdomen
Bowel - malrotation
Pancreas - truncated
Heart - ASD, VSD, PAPVR (less severe congenital heart disease)
  Right sided isomerism (asplenia)
Things that would normally be found on the right side are duplicated on the left side too. Strong association with severe congenital heart disease means the condition has a mortality rate of 80% by age 1. Beyond that, the most consistent feature is the absence of the spleen. Once again, the other features are commonly associated, but variably demonstrated.
Heart - TAPVR and other anomalies (Almost 100% have severe cyanotic congenital heart disease)
Spleen - absent
Lung lobes - three on either side (specific finding)
Liver - normal position (can be midline or malpositioned)
Bowel - malrotation
IVC - on same side as aorta (usually the right)
Kidneys - associated with horseshoe kidney",FALSE,"Asplenia is associated with more complex cardiac anomalies than polysplenia, and these cardiac anomalies can lead to poorer prognosis than polysplenia. Patients with asplenia are more likely to have more severe cardiac defects and complications, such as single ventricle physiology, and this can lead to higher morbidity and mortality rates. Additionally, patients with asplenia are more likely to require multiple surgeries and other interventions to manage their condition, which can also lead to poorer prognosis than polysplenia.",1,"3.

This question falls under category 1: Basic factual recall, either of basic science, physics, anatomy or regarding a procedure.",D,FALSE,"I chose option 4 because it states that ""Asplenia is associated with a horseshoe kidney,"" which is NOT correct. Heterotaxy syndrome is a rare congenital disorder that involves the abnormal arrangement of internal organs. It can be classified into two main types: asplenia (absence of a spleen) and polysplenia (multiple spleens). 

While both asplenia and polysplenia can be associated with various organ abnormalities, a horseshoe kidney is not specifically associated with asplenia. A horseshoe kidney is a congenital disorder in which the two kidneys are fused together at the lower end, forming a U-shape. It can occur in isolation or in association with other congenital anomalies, but it is not a characteristic feature of asplenia in heterotaxy syndrome.",D,TRUE,A
14141,205045,A 6-year-old boy swallows a coin and is brought in by his parents with abdominal pain. An X-ray is performed that shows the coin is lodged in the region of the gastroesophageal junction. Which region of the stomach does the oesophagus open into? Select ONE answer only.,SBA: Gastrointestinal,The cardia,The fundus,The body,The pylorus,The lesser curvature,A,83%,10%,4%,1%,2%,"Explanation:
The stomach is a J-shaped digestive organ that lies in the superior aspect of the abdomen between the oesophagus and the duodenum.
  It has four main regions:
The cardia – which is around the opening of the oesophagus
The fundus – which is the dilated superior portion lying beneath the left dome of the diaphragm
The body – which is the large central position lying between the fundus and the pylorus
The pylorus – which is the lower portion that facilitates the emptying of its contents into the duodenum
  The medial and lateral borders of the stomach are curved, forming the greater and lesser curvatures of the stomach:
The greater curvature – forms the longer, convex, lateral border of the stomach. The greater omentum arises from it.
The lesser curvature – forms the shorter, concave, medial border of the stomach. The lesser omentum arises from it.
  There is a sharp indentation two-thirds of the way along the lesser curvature called the angular notch. This point marks the junction of the body and the pylorus.
  Food boluses enter the stomach via the lower oesophageal sphincter. Once within the stomach protein digesting enzymes, such as pepsin, are released. Hydrochloric acid within the stomach provides a suitably acidic pH for these enzymes to work and also serves to kills bacteria. The food boluses are churned up by peristaltic contractions of the wall and converted into chyme. The passage of chyme into the duodenum is controlled by the pyloric sphincter, which lies between the pylorus and the duodenum.
   ",TRUE,"I chose number 2 because the gastroesophageal junction is the area where the oesophagus opens into the stomach.

This question is a little ambiguous. The imaging findings allude do to haemorrhage but the underlying lesion could be any potential adrenal lesion, including a myelolipoma. It is not possible to distinguish that on the basis of the information given.
Adrenal haemorrhage can be unilateral or bilateral, traumatic or non-traumatic. Around 20% of unilateral adrenal haemorrhage occurs in a non-traumatic setting. Physiological stress increases adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) and this acts on the adrenal glands to increase vascularity the better to secrete adrenaline. An unfortunate side effect is the propensity for intraglandular haemorrhage. Any one of a number of situations can lead to sufficient stress to cause this but the usual culprits are:
Surgery
Sepsis (aka Waterhouse-Friderichsen syndrome)
Burns
Hypotension

  An acute presentation is more likely with bilateral haemorrhage owing to the concurrent adrenal insufficiency this is likely to herald however if imaging is performed for the index cause then unilateral haemorrhage may also be detected. Within the first week the haemorrhage will be seen as high attenuation on CT (50-90HU). Thereafter the Hounsfield units will decline as the blood degrades. Most will go on to complete resolution but adrenal calcification is a known long-term consequence of adrenal haemorrhage. The MRI findings relate closely to the timeframes involved and are depicted in the table.
  GRE sequences
Gradient echo sequences are used in conjunction or instead of spin-echo sequences in some circumstances. They do not encompass a 180o refocusing pulse and as such are far more susceptible to the effects of T2* as well as the dephasing effects of paramagnetic iron in haemorrhage. Consequently, if something is dark on GRE sequences this is often a strong indicator of haemorrhage of some description.
  Waterhouse-Friderichsen syndrome
This is the name given to adrenal insufficiency when it occurs as a consequence of bilateral adrenal haemorrhage in the context of sepsis.",FALSE,"Angiomyolipoma is the most likely diagnosis based on the imaging findings. This is because the lesion is hypodense on the CT scan (80HU), and it returns high signal on the T1 and T2 sequences of the MRI, but is dark on the T2 GRE sequence. This is consistent with the characteristics of an angiomyolipoma, which is a benign tumor composed of fat, smooth muscle, and blood vessels.",2,,B,FALSE,"I chose Angiomyolipoma because the imaging findings described are consistent with this diagnosis. Angiomyolipomas are benign tumors that contain a mixture of blood vessels, smooth muscle, and fat. They are commonly found in the kidneys but can also occur in the adrenal glands.

The CT scan findings show that the lesion has a high attenuation value of 80 Hounsfield Units (HU) on both enhanced and unenhanced images, which suggests the presence of fat within the lesion. This is a characteristic feature of angiomyolipomas.

The MRI findings also support the diagnosis of angiomyolipoma. The lesion demonstrates high signal intensity on both T1 and T2-weighted images, which is consistent with the presence of fat. Additionally, the lesion appears dark on the T2 gradient echo (GRE) sequence, which suggests the presence of microscopic fat or hemorrhage, both of which can be seen in angiomyolipomas.

The other options listed are less likely based on the imaging findings:

2. Haemorrhage: While hemorrhage can cause high signal intensity on T1-weighted images, it would not typically cause high signal intensity on T2-weighted images or have high attenuation on CT.

3. Myelolipoma: Myelolipomas are also benign adrenal tumors containing fat and hematopoietic tissue. However, they usually have lower attenuation on CT and would not typically appear dark on T2 GRE sequences.

4. Protein rich cyst: Protein-rich cysts would not have high attenuation on CT, and their MRI signal characteristics would be different (low signal on T1 and high signal on T2).

5. Waterhouse-Friderichsen syndrome: This is a rare, life-threatening condition characterized by adrenal gland hemorrhage due to septicemia. It would not present as an incidental adrenal lesion with the imaging findings described.",B,FALSE,E

The priorities as far as surgery are concerned are:
Haemostasis

13749,205045,A 7-year-old girl is found to have high blood pressure during a routine school check. She is investigated and her chest x-ray shows a figure of 3 sign. Echocardiography confirms a diagnosis of coarctation of the aorta. Which of the following is most commonly seen in association with coarctation of the aorta?,SBA: Paediatrics,Patent ductus arteriosus,Ventricular septal defect,Atrial septal defect,Turner syndrome,Truncus arteriosus,A,39%,10%,9%,39%,3%,"Explanation:
Coarctation
A congenital narrowing of the aorta at the level of the ductus arteriosus is known as coarctation. This can present neonatally when the point of stenosis is preductal. This means the body and lower limbs are supplied primarily via a patent ductus arteriosus. When coarctation presents later, even in adulthood, the point of stenosis is usually post-ductal with established collateralization via the subclavian and intercostals arteries. It is this collateral pathway which gives rise to the rib notching seen on a CXR.
Rib notching is due to chronic bony remodeling and it takes until around the age of 20 for it to become radiologically evident. Of note the intercostal arteries to the first and second ribs arise from the costocervical trunk and therefore the first and second ribs do not show rib notching. Furthermore should the patient have an aberrant right subclavian artery (ARSCA) as well as coarctation they will only demonstrate rib notching on the left side since the ARSCA originates distal to the stenotic point.
The other specific CXR sign associated with coarctation is the ‘figure of 3’ sign which refers to the contour of the descending aorta.
Coarctation of the aorta, like most of the other congenital cardiovascular abnormalities, has the usual sprinkling of associations. At least half of patients have a bicuspid aortic valve. As well as PDAs, VSDs are also common. There is a particular association with Turner syndrome (45, XO).
  Associations:
Bicuspid aortic valve - 50%

Pyeloureteritis cystica
This condition causes the formation of numerous small fluid-filled submucosal cysts as part of a hyperplastic transitional cell response to chronic urinary tract infections. Elderly and diabetic patients are therefore predisposed to developing the condition. The cysts show up as filling defects within the proximal ureters on a CT urogram. They can be found in the bladder and renal pelvis in addition to the ureters but are most frequently encountered in the proximal ureters.

Ileal conduits are best imaged either by CT urography or retrograde as a so-called loopogram (also known as a conduitogram). It is common to see some foci of gas within the ileal conduit following the surgery but less common (although by no means impossible) for the gas bubbles to track into the ureters. Gas on a CT scan is usually sufficiently distinct to differentiate it as a cause of the filling defects.

Transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) is the most common type of bladder cancer, and it can also involve the ureters. Given the patient's history of bladder cancer, it is more likely that the filling defects seen on the CT urogram represent metachronous TCC, which means the cancer has developed in the ureters at a later time than the initial bladder cancer.

A sagittal sinus thrombosis can present with seizures.",FALSE,"I chose this answer because posterior reversible encephalopathy (PRES) is a common cause of seizures in young adults and is characterized by high signal on FLAIR in the parasagittal cortex bilaterally. It is usually caused by a sudden increase in blood pressure or other systemic insults such as sepsis, chemotherapy, or immunosuppression. The patient's history of a diarrhoea and vomiting bug suggests that they may have had a systemic insult that triggered the PRES.",2,,B,FALSE,"I chose option 1, Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome (PRES), because the clinical presentation and MRI findings are consistent with this condition. The patient's symptoms of diarrhea, vomiting, and lethargy, followed by an acute seizure, suggest a possible electrolyte imbalance or other metabolic disturbance. The MRI finding of high signal on FLAIR in the parasagittal cortex bilaterally is also consistent with PRES, which typically presents with vasogenic edema in the subcortical white matter, often in a symmetric pattern.

PRES is a neurological disorder that can be caused by various factors, such as hypertension, renal failure, autoimmune diseases, and certain medications. It is characterized by a rapid onset of symptoms, including headache, seizures, altered mental status, and visual disturbances.

The principle of mammography and ultrasound is not diagnosis, although at times both will suggest a diagnosis. Their role is to guide further management, hence the grading system (R1-5, U1-5). A suspicious lesion on either mammography or ultrasound must receive a tissue diagnosis (assuming the patient is appropriate for and amenable to such).
Ultrasound guided biopsies would be essentially blind-biopsies since the lesion cannot be seen on ultrasound. Since the lesion can be seen on mammography, a stereotactic biopsy (i.e. a mammography guided biopsy) is the next best option. An MRI may be performed in due course, however a tissue diagnosis (whether benign or malignant) is what is ultimately required for this lesion. Similarly re-imaging may be appropriate as well but will not provide a tissue diagnosis.",FALSE,"Surgical excision is the most appropriate next step of management in this case because the lesion is impalpable and the ultrasound of the breast reveals no abnormality.

14313,205045,You are performing an ultrasound scan on a 27-year-old lady. She has presented with severe abdominal pain and is on day 7 of her menstrual cycle. You suspect she may have ovarian torsion. Which of the following regarding this diagnosis is NOT correct? Select ONE answer only.,"SBA: Genito urinary, Adrenal, Obstetrics & Gynaecology and Breast",The most common cause of ovarian torsion is a tubo-ovarian abscess,The diagnosis is not excluded by the presence of doppler flow in the ovary,The ovary will be larger than normal,Small fluid pockets seen around the edge of the ovary are in-keeping with the diagnosis,Torsion is more common during early pregnancy,A,75%,4%,2%,9%,10%,"Explanation:
Please note that the question asks which answer is NOT correct.
  Ovarian torsion
At least half of all ovarian torsion is caused by a lead point (i.e. an ovarian mass). Most cases are due to a corpus luteum cyst or follicular cyst with a dermoid cyst being the next most common cause. Torsion is also more common during early pregnancy than in non-pregnant patients. On ultrasound the ovary itself will be enlarged (>4cm in length), and heterogenously echogenic. In the periphery of the ovary, small fluid-filled follicles may be appreciated. On doppler ultrasound scan, twisting of the ovarian pedicle is a useful sign but actual flow within the ovary itself does not exclude torsion since it is venous flow which is lost first.
Symptoms may resolve spontaneously with de-torsion but otherwise laparoscopy is indicated to de-tort the ovary and remove any lead point. If the ovary is infarcted at the time of surgery this will also be resected.
  Mature teratoma
(Immature) teratomas and dermoid cysts (mature teratomas) have very similar imaging characteristics despite their histological differences. Teratomas are the most common ovarian neoplasm but are slow growing and usually benign. By contrast immature teratomas are malignant. The presence of fat is a strong indicator for a mature teratoma with the combination of fat, fluid and calcification being highly specific. On MRI the fat will show the usual signal drop-out on fat saturated sequences. Calcification will show as low signal on T2. Although benign, mature teratomas can be complicated by torsion or rupture. Malignant degeneration if it does occur, is to squamous cell carcinoma most commonly.
Mature teratomas can have a variety of appearances on ultrasound scan depending on their internal composition. Posterior acoustic shadowing suggests the presence of calcification.
  The corpus luteum
The corpus luteum consists of the remnant of a ruptured ovarian follicle following ovulation. It produces oestrogen and progesterone to sustain a pregnancy following fertilisation. On ultrasound it is seen as a thick-walled cyst with peripheral vascularity on colour Doppler flow. This 'ring of fire' appearance can be confused with an ectopic pregnancy.",FALSE,"I chose this answer because ovarian torsion is more likely to occur during the pre-ovulatory and ovulatory phases of the menstrual cycle, not during early pregnancy. During early pregnancy, the ovary is larger than normal due to increased blood flow and hormonally-induced changes, which would make it less likely to be affected by torsion.",1,"3. A question about clinical decision making, what is the best course of action?

This question falls under 3. A question about clinical decision making, what is the best course of action?",C,TRUE,"I chose option 4 because it states that ""the most common cause of ovarian torsion is a tubo-ovarian abscess,"" which is NOT correct. The most common cause of ovarian torsion is actually an ovarian mass or cyst, which can lead to an imbalance in the ovary's position and cause it to twist. A tubo-ovarian abscess is an infection involving the fallopian tubes and ovaries, and while it can cause severe abdominal pain, it is not the most common cause of ovarian torsion.",A,FALSE,D
14581,205045,"A 45-year-old lady is being investigated for atypical chest pains which she has been experiencing for the last two months. She is worried as she has a strong family history of heart problems. She undergoes a 24-hour ECG which is normal, but an exercise ECG shows some lateral T-wave inversion. Which of the following is the next best test to perform? Select ONE answer only.",SBA: Cardiothoracic and vascular,Adenosine stress MRI,Cardiac CT,Dobutamine stress MRI,Stress echo,Invasive angiogram,A,49%,20%,20%,8%,4%,"Explanation:
This lady is showing some signs of myocardial ischaemia during exercise. The best modality to image this and demonstrates the extent of the territory involved would therefore be a stressed test. The best test for this would be an adenosine stress MRI.
  Adenosine stress MRI has overtaken dobutamine stress MRI in terms of sensitivity and specificity for investigating the presence of ischaemia or infarction. Adenosine causes coronary vasodilation. If there is a haemodynamically significant stenosis to a coronary vessel, the vessels distal to the stenosis are already maximally dilated to maximise flow and thus the application of adenosine makes no difference to the vessel calibre or the resultant perfusion. Furthermore, the vasodilatation to the remaining unoccluded vessels can 'steal' blood from the stenosed territory and this is seen as hypoperfusion to the affected territory. Dipyridamole (antiplatelet), blocks uptake of adenosine and so patients taking this are also poor candidates for this test, however dipyridimole itself can also induce vasodilatation so may be used as an agent in its own right instead of adenosine. 
Contraindications to adenosine include:
Second or third degree heart block
Bronchospasm
Hypotension <90mmHg systolic
Myocardial infarction within 48hrs
Uncontrolled arrhythmia
Severe/critical aortic stenosis
The half-life of adenosine is exceptionally short, around 10 seconds, thus any side effects experienced during the scan resolve very quickly. It also means that during the scan, in order to maintain the effect, the adenosine must be given as an infusion.
  Dobutamine stress MRI used to be used but has largely been superseded by adenosine stress MRIs. Dobutamine is a sympathomimetic so works by inducing the heart to beat both faster and stronger. By increasing the stress on the whole heart, hitherto compensated areas are unmasked. The drug is given at increasing doses ever 3 minutes until any of:
The heart rate has increased to around 85% of its resting maximum
New wall motion abnormality is seen
Blood pressure rises above 240/220mmHg
Systolic blood pressure falls by 40mmHg
The patient develops persistent arrhythmias
The patient becomes too symptomatic to continue the scan
Aside from the usual contra-indications to performing the MRI in the first place, specific contra-indications to performing a dobutamine stress MRI include:
Hypertension >220/120mmHg
Unstable angina
Aortic stenosis (severe)
Uncontrolled atrial fibrillation
Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy
Congestive heart failure
  A stress echocardiogram is particularly useful for further investigating patients in whom a stress ECG was inconclusive. Many patients are unable to tolerate the physical demands (treadmill) of a stress ECG. Patients are given dobutamine, much like for a stress cardiac MRI study. Wall-motion abnormalities can be seen, as with cardiac MRI, and these correspond to areas of non-viable or hibernating myocardium and provide targets for revascularisation. An echocardiogram has the obvious advantages of lower cost, wider availability and faster scanning time than an MRI. The contra-indications to this test are the same as those for cardiac MRI.
Cardiac CT is indicated for acute cardiac or major vessel pathology as it is quick and more readily available than MRI. It can be used to assess the calcium-score of the coronary arteries as well as patency/occlusions to identify targets for acute revascularisation. It is also useful for quantifying aneurysmal dilatation of the aortic root.
  An invasive angiogram is also indicated for acute ischaemic cardiac pathology, particularly in the presence of ECG changes suggesting an acute myocardial infarction. Ideally this can then lead to endovascular stenting or clot-retrieval to open up the target artery. The procedure is obviously not without risk but can be life-saving, and is still considered as the gold standard for diagnosing coronary artery stenosis however the fact of stenosis does not provide information on the effect of the underlying myocardium. In the acute scenario it is reasonable to assume that a stenosed vessel is the cause of the symptoms, but the picture is less straightforward in sub-acute or chronic chest pains.",FALSE,"Invasive angiogram is the next best test to perform because it is the most accurate test for diagnosing coronary artery disease. It involves inserting a catheter into the coronary arteries and injecting contrast dye to visualize the coronary arteries and any blockages. This test can provide detailed information about the anatomy of the heart, including the size and shape of the coronary arteries, the degree of any blockages, and the degree of narrowing of the arteries. It can also help to determine the best treatment plan for the patient.",1,"3. A question about the application of knowledge, what is the best test to perform?",E,FALSE,"I chose option 4, Stress echo, because it is the most appropriate test in this situation. The patient has atypical chest pains and a normal 24-hour ECG, but the exercise ECG showed some lateral T-wave inversion, which may indicate ischemia. A stress echocardiogram (stress echo) is a non-invasive test that can help determine if the patient has significant coronary artery disease by assessing the heart's response to stress.

Stress echo combines echocardiography (ultrasound imaging of the heart) with an exercise or pharmacological stress test. It allows the physician to visualize the heart's function at rest and during stress, helping to identify areas of the heart that may not be receiving enough blood due to blocked arteries.

The other options, such as Cardiac CT, Dobutamine stress MRI, Adenosine stress MRI, and Invasive angiogram, may also provide valuable information regarding coronary artery disease, but they may not be the most appropriate next step in this specific case. Stress echo is a more suitable choice due to its non-invasive nature, ability to assess the heart's response to stress, and its effectiveness in detecting coronary artery disease in patients with atypical chest pain and abnormal exercise ECG findings.",D,TRUE,A

There are three types of this prion transmitted disease; the one linked to the BSE (bovine spongiform encephalopathy) epidemic of the late 1980s and 1990s, a rare familial variant, and finally a sporadic version which accounts for the vast majority of the cases. Clinically there is a rapidly progressive dementia with ataxia and myoclonus which should be the give-away feature even before imaging features are discussed. On MRI, the reported finding is of high T2/FLAIR signal in the basal ganglia bilaterally and symmetrically (particularly the putamen). The pulvinar sign is often described in association with cJD which describes high FLAIR signal in the pulvinar thalamic nuclei (called the hockey stick sign). Strangely the signal changes are a rare cause of restriction of diffusion, seen as bright areas on DWI. Important negatives for this condition are the lack of enhancement with contrast and the lack of white matter involvement (since the white matter is protected by its myelin sheath).
  Lewy body dementia
A core clinical feature to this dementia is the fluctuant nature of the symptoms. Parkinsonian features can also develop although these are usually subsequent to the memory decline. Visual hallucinations are also a feature. Radiologically there is a generalised decrease in cerebral volume (sparing the hippocampi). Temporo-parietal hypoperfusion on HMPAO Tc99m SPECT scanning is indicative of Lewy body dementia. Involvement of the occipital cortex, which is typically spared in Alzheimer's disease, sets the two apart from one another on PET studies. The cingulate island sign has also been ascribed to Lewy body dementia, where there is preservation of metabolism in the mid-posterior cingulate gyrus. If present, this is said to be specific for Lewy body dementia.
  Alzheimer's disease
The radiological findings of this well known disease are diffuse sulcal and ventricular enlargement. There is a disproportionate effect to the anterior temporal lobes, hippocampi and sylvian fissures with sparing of the sensorimotor and visual cortices, thalami and cerebellum.
  Parkinson's disease
Generalised cerebral atrophy occurs with Parkinson's disease but is a highly non-specific feature. There are, however, radiological findings in the midbrain which although subtle, are far more specific. Parkinson's disease occurs when there is neuronal loss in the substantia nigra, specifically the pars compacta of the substantia nigra. On a T2 weighted MRI image this appears as blurring of the intermediate signal intensity line which separates the two adjacent low intensity structures (these are the pars reticulata of the substantia nigra and the red nucleus).",FALSE,"The correct answer is 3. Sparing of the hippocampi - Lewy body dementia. This is incorrect because Lewy body dementia is characterized by the presence of Lewy bodies in the hippocampi, not the sparing of the hippocampi.",1,"This question falls under category 1: Basic factual recall, either of basic science, physics, anatomy or regarding a procedure.",D,FALSE,"I chose option 3 because it incorrectly matches the finding of ""sparing of the hippocampi"" to Lewy body dementia. In Lewy body dementia, there is usually atrophy of the hippocampi, not sparing. The other options correctly match the findings to their respective conditions.",D,FALSE,C
13943,205045,You are reviewing the imaging of a 41-year-old female patient. On a CT scan there is a geographic area abnormality in segment IV which is hypoattenuating when compared to the rest of the liver. The rest of the liver appears normal in size and shape. On a Primovist enhanced MRI scan there is no distortion of the vascular architecture. What is the most likely diagnosis?,SBA: Gastrointestinal,Focal fatty infiltration,Focal Nodular Hyperplasia,Haemangioma,Hepatocellular carcinoma,Hepatic abscess,A,94%,3%,2%,0%,1%,"Explanation:
Gadoxetic acid disodium (Primovist) and gadobentate disodium (MultiHance) are hepatobiliary specific MRI contrast agents. They are taken up by hepatocytes.
Primovist is labelled with gadolinium in the same way that non-hepatobiliary specific agents such as Dotarem are. Their enhancement characteristics on the arterial and portal venous phases are all but identical, it is only on the delayed hepatobiliary phase (at least 20mins following injection) when the characteristics differ. At this point, the Primovist begins to be excreted by the hepatocytes and there will be enhancement anywhere where there is bile (biliary tree, gallbladder, possibly into the duodenum etc, and any bile leaks). At the same time FNHs remain bright compared to the normal background liver since the hepatocytes within them have taken up the Primovist but excretion is delayed by the abnormality of the associated biliary ductules in the lesion.
Focal steatosis also known as focal fatty infiltration
The liver plays a small role in fat storage, and subtle variation in blood supply and drainage between different areas can lead to variations in the amount of fat in those areas. Focal fatty change is very common and has a geographic appearance on all imaging modalities, with a lack of mass effect (i.e. preservation of the vascular architecture). It can occur anywhere within the liver but is classically found adjacent to the falciform ligament (i.e. segments II, III and IV). Fat-identifying sequences on MRI can be very useful to confirm the diagnosis with signal drop out on out-of-phase images. Focal fatty sparing on the other hand appears as the inverse of this and on CT will be seen as isoattenuation on a background of a diffusely hypoattenuating liver. On ultrasound the liver will be diffusely hyperechoic when compared to the right kidney, and the spared area will be hypoechoic.
  Steatosis can be focal or diffuse. In this example of diffuse steatosis there is signal drop out in the whole of the liver on the out-of phase images:

  Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)
Although metastases are the most common cause of malignant hepatic lesions, hepatocellular carcinoma is the most common primary hepatic malignancy. It usually arises on a background of cirrhosis of any cause. Patients with any of the hepatitis viruses, alcoholic cirrhosis, haemochromatosis, and Wilson disease are all at risk. Carcinogens such as thorotrast and aflatoxin also predispose to HCC formation. Serum alpha fetoprotein levels are often raised, in contrast with cholangiocarcinomas which are one of the main differential diagnoses.
  On imaging HCCs can have a variety of appearances. A large irregular mass with satellite nodules is the most common finding but a diffuse infiltrative version can also occur. Since HCCs derive their blood supply from the hepatic artery they show arterial enhancement on CT with washout on later phases. On ultrasound HCCs tend to be hyperechoic when compared to the rest of the liver and on MRI they show variable signal intensity on both T1 and T2 but arterial enhancement with venous washout can again be seen once Gadolinium has been given. Usually they return slightly higher signal on T2 than the remainder of the liver.
  Fibrolamellar carcinoma of the liver is a specific subtype which occurs in slightly younger patients with otherwise normal livers. It is an echogenic lobulated mass on ultrasound with a central fibrous scar which does not enhance on CT. The lack of enhancement, and sometimes presence of calcification, within the scar separates it from fibrous nodular hyperplasia which is the main differential diagnosis.  On MRI the scar returns low signal on T1 and T2 owing to its fibrous nature.
  Thorotrast is a carcinogenic historic contrast agent used in the 30s and 40s. Its use was abruptly curtailed once it was realised that it is retained indefinitely in the reticuloendothelial system. It causes hepatocellular carcinomas and cholangiocarcinomas but hepatic angiosarcomas are the most frequently quoted related malignancies.
  Haemangioma
Cavernous hepatic haemangiomas are the most common solid benign liver lesions and the second most common liver lesion overall (after secondary tumours). Pathologically they are composed of large vascular channels in which the blood flows very slowly. They are usually supplied by the hepatic artery which goes some way to explaining their enhancement characteristics. With all contrast studies three different types of enhancement can be seen.
Flash haemangiomas – these show immediate and uniform enhancement which persists on delayed sequences (unlike hypervascular tumours which wash out)
Peripheral nodular enhancement on arterial imaging with complete filling in on delayed images
Peripheral nodular enhancement with incomplete filling in – this usually occurs in giant (>5cm diameter) haemangiomas where the central portion is thrombosed.
  On ultrasound they are usually well-defined hyperechoic compared to normal liver parenchyma. Contrast enhanced ultrasound is coming to the forefront of diagnosis for solitary hepatic lesions, relieving some of the burden of MRI. Haemangiomas show either flash filling or peripheral nodular increased reflectivity followed by a gradual total or near total filling in when microbubble contrast is given.
  On MRI the slow flowing blood causes very high signal on T2 weighted images, higher than the spleen and high enough to cause T2 shine through on diffusion weighted images. Conversely although metastases will also show high T2 signal they do not usually outshine the spleen in this regard. Similarly to contrast enhanced ultrasound findings for a haemangioma, the pattern of gradual filling in is replicated with gadolinium-based contrast agents on an MRI scan although on the delayed phase of a hepatobiliary specific contrast agent the lesion will be low in signal as haemangiomas do not contain normal hepatocytes.
  Nuclear medicine studies can be useful in the diagnosis of heamangiomata. Sulphur colloid studies will show a photopenic area initially which 1-2hours later shows increased uptake.
  Focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH)
These lesions typically occur in women in late middle age. They are not caused by oral contraceptive use however they do enlarge in response to hormone stimulation. They are composed of hyperplastic hepatocytes and are thought to arise when a small underlying congenital vascular malformation means that an area of the liver receives a better blood supply and therefore grows better, thus they lack a true capsule but can outgrow their blood supply resulting in the classical central fibrous scar which is present in around half of cases. On imaging they do demonstrate mass effect, displacing adjacent vessels, have marked arterial enhancement which fits in with their supposed aetiology. The central scar enhances only on delayed sequences. On MRI they tend to return high signal on T2 weighted sequences. Their appearance on contrast enhanced ultrasound is interesting; the central scar enhances very early in the arterial phase, branching out in a spoke-wheel type of appearance. During the main arterial phase the lesions enhance strongly before becoming isoechoic in the portal venous phase. On the delayed hepatobiliary phases the lesions are shown to have retained contrast while the adjacent normal liver parenchyma will gradually wash out.  They are the only hepatic lesions to do this.

      Hepatic Adenoma
These benign masses are caused by hormone use (including anabolic steroid use) although they can arise without such exposure. They are composed of hepatocytes without portal tract or bile ducts. Kupffer cells are also absent meaning they do not take up hepotocyte-specific MRI agents such as Primovist. Like FNH they can have a central scar but unlike FNH they have a fibrous pseudocapsule seen on ultrasound as a hypoechoic rim surrounding the otherwise (usually but not always) hyperechoic mass. They have a tendency to outgrow their blood supply which can result in spontaneous haemorrhage (this is often the presenting feature). CT is useful in this regard, as an acute imaging technique however adenomas show arterial enhancement much like FNH making the diagnosis difficult. MRI using Primovist is therefore more useful. On the unenhanced images adenomas are isointense to the rest of the liver on T1, and loses signal on out of phase images much like FNH however adenomas do not enhance with Primovist where FNHs do.
  Hepatic abscess
Liver abscesses can occur in children, for much the same reasons as they arise in adults, although they are far more common in adults. In neonates they may arise as a complication from a misplaced umbilical venous catheter. Pyogenic abscesses result from bacteria accessing the liver via the biliary tree, septicaemia, direct spread, trauma or during a liver procedure. Adult patients are usually in their 60s. Amoebic abscesses occur in slightly younger patients (40s) and tend to result from spread of amoebae from the colon via the portal venous system. On ultrasound abscesses appear as a hypoechoic mass with posterior acoustic enhancement. Internal debris may be apparent. On CT they are usually low in attenuation and may have a rim of enhancing tissue depending on the phase of the contrast. MRI signal characteristics are dependent on the protein content of the pus but usually abscesses return little T1 signal and, owing to their fluid nature, return high signal on T2 weighted sequences. It is said that amoebic abscesses are usually found to be contiguous with the liver capsule.",TRUE,"Focal fatty infiltration is the most likely diagnosis because it is the most common benign liver lesion. It is typically seen as a hypoattenuating area on CT scans, which is consistent with the findings in this case. Additionally, Primovist enhanced MRI scans are typically used to diagnose focal nodular hyperplasia and haemangiomas, but since there is no distortion of the vascular architecture, these two diagnoses are less likely. Hepatocellular carcinoma and hepatic abscess are also less likely because they are usually associated with more extensive and obvious abnormalities in the imaging.",2,,C,TRUE,"I chose option 3, Focal fatty infiltration, because the description of the imaging findings is consistent with this diagnosis. The geographic area of abnormality in segment IV is hypoattenuating compared to the rest of the liver on CT scan, which is a characteristic finding in focal fatty infiltration. Additionally, the Primovist enhanced MRI scan shows no distortion of the vascular architecture, further supporting the diagnosis of focal fatty infiltration rather than a vascular or neoplastic lesion. The other options are less likely given the imaging findings described.",A,TRUE,A
14421,205045,Which SINGLE statement regarding the blood supply to the liver is true?,SBA: Gastrointestinal,The hepatic portal vein supplies poorly oxygenated blood from the gastrointestinal tract,The hepatic artery is the dominant blood supply to the liver,Each lobe of the liver has its own hepatic vein,The majority of the liver’s oxygen demand is met by the hepatic artery,The hepatic veins drain into the inferior vena cava via an opening situated superior to the diaphragm,A,68%,2%,12%,9%,8%,"Explanation:
The liver receives its blood supply from two separate sources:
Hepatic portal vein (70-75% of supply)
Hepatic artery (25-30% of supply)
  The hepatic portal vein is the dominant blood supply to the liver. It supplies the liver with poorly oxygenated blood from the spleen and gastrointestinal tract. This blood contains nutrients absorbed from the small intestine and allows the liver to perform important functions such as detoxification.
The hepatic artery carries oxygenated blood from the aorta via the coeliac trunk.
Oxygen is provided from both sources, approximately half of the liver’s oxygen demand being met by each of the sources. The hepatic portal vein and hepatic artery terminate at the porta hepatis by divided into right and left branches to supply the right and left lobes respectively.
Because of this dual supply liver infarction is a relatively rare event. It is also possible for a one-sided infarction to occur.
The hepatic veins are responsible for the venous drainage of the liver. There are usually three hepatic veins draining from the left, middle, and right parts of the liver. These are formed by the union of the central veins of the liver and drain into the inferior vena cava via an opening situated just inferior to the diaphragm.
  The hepatic portal vein and its tributaries (from Gray’s Anatomy)",FALSE,"The hepatic artery is the dominant blood supply to the liver, meaning that it supplies the majority of the oxygen and nutrients needed by the liver. This is the only statement that accurately describes the blood supply to the liver.",1,1. Basic factual recall,B,TRUE,"I chose option 2 because it is the most accurate statement regarding the blood supply to the liver. The hepatic portal vein indeed supplies poorly oxygenated blood from the gastrointestinal tract to the liver. This blood is rich in nutrients, which the liver processes, stores, and distributes to the rest of the body. The hepatic portal vein carries approximately 75% of the liver's blood supply, with the remaining 25% coming from the hepatic artery, which supplies well-oxygenated blood.",A,FALSE,B
14254,205045,Which of the following arteries is a direct branch of the common hepatic artery? Select ONE answer only.,SBA: Gastrointestinal,Right gastric artery,Left gastric artery,Short gastric arteries,Left gastro-omental artery,Right gastro-omental artery,A,66%,19%,3%,2%,10%,"Explanation:
The stomach receives an extensive arterial supply that is derived from the coeliac trunk and its branches. Anastomoses form along the lesser curvature by the left and right gastric arteries and long the greater curvature by the left and right gastro-omental arteries.
The arteries supplying the stomach are:
The left gastric artery – arises directly from the coeliac trunk
The right gastric artery – is a branch of the common hepatic artery, which arises from the coeliac trunk
The left gastro-omental artery – is a branch of the splenic artery, which arises from the coeliac axis

14223,205045,A new born baby is noted to have a swelling on his neck. An ultrasound scan shows enlargement of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. The thyroid and salivary glands appear normal. What is the most likely diagnosis? Select ONE answer only.,SBA: Paediatrics,Fibromatosis coli,Cystic hygroma,Haematoma,Thyroglossal cyst,Second branchial cleft cyst,A,89%,3%,4%,0%,4%,"Explanation:
Fibromatosis coli is a fibrotic process which occurs in the sternocleidomastoid muscle and is usually found in the neonatal period following a difficult or instrumental delivery. On ultrasound there is enlargement of the sternocleidomastoid muscle itself but no mass per se. Most cases resolve spontaneously over the ensuing months.
Cystic hygroma are usually (but not exclusively) multilocular and are situated in the posterior triangle of the neck.
A second branchial cleft cyst is usually described as being between the submandibular gland and the sternocleidomastoid muscle.
A thyroglossal duct cyst is usually midline or close to midline.
  Neck Masses in Children © Medical Exam Prep
 ",FALSE,"I chose 5 because a second branchial cleft cyst is the most likely diagnosis in this case. This is because the ultrasound scan shows enlargement of the sternocleidomastoid muscle and the thyroid and salivary glands appear normal, which are common findings in a second branchial cleft cyst. A cystic hygroma, haematoma, and fibromatosis coli are all unlikely in this case as they can cause enlargement of other structures such as lymph nodes, which was not seen on the ultrasound scan. A thyroglossal cyst is also unlikely in this case as it is usually associated with a midline neck mass that is not seen in this case.",2,,E,TRUE,"I chose option 1, Fibromatosis coli, because the clinical presentation and ultrasound findings are consistent with this condition. Fibromatosis coli, also known as congenital torticollis, is characterized by the enlargement of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, which is observed in the given scenario. This condition can lead to a swelling on the neck and is commonly seen in newborns. The normal appearance of the thyroid and salivary glands further supports this diagnosis, as these structures are not typically involved in fibromatosis coli.",A,TRUE,A
14159,205045,You are reviewing cases for the next urology MDT. A 65-year-old man has been diagnosed with prostate cancer following TRUS biopsies. His pre-procedure MRI is to be discussed at the meeting. Which of the following features on MRI is most indicative of the presence of prostate cancer? Select ONE answer only.,"SBA: Genito urinary, Adrenal, Obstetrics & Gynaecology and Breast",Low ADC,High signal DWI B0,Low signal on DWI B1200,High T2 signal,High T1 signal,A,85%,9%,3%,3%,1%,"Explanation:
Low signal on the ADC map is the most sensitive sign of peripheral zone prostate cancer.
MRI is currently performed as a staging tool for prostate cancer, not as a screening tool. Unfortunately, following biopsy for confirmation of diagnosis, the presence of haemorrhage within the prostate can compromise the diagnostic quality of the images. It is for this reason that in many centres prostate MRI scans are performed on the basis of elevated PSA levels and suspicious findings on digital rectal examination to exclude the need for a 6-8 week delay between a biopsy and the MRI.
The T1 weighted sequences are most useful for excluding the presence of haemorrhagic foci within the prostate. Haemorrhage will appear bright on a T1 weighted image. T2 weighted sequences are most useful for confirming the presence of prostate cancer itself which will be seen as low signal against the high signal of the normal peripheral zone.
  MRI prostate T1 (best to exclude haemorrhage) T2 (best to see prostate cancer)
Normal peripheral zone Intermediate High
Prostate cancer Isointense to the peripheral zone Low
Haemorrhage High Low
  Prostate cancer
The vast majority of cancers of the prostate are adenocarcinomas and the risk of developing prostate cancer increases with age to such an extent that by the age of 80 approximately 80% of men will have some neoplastic foci within the prostate although these may be completely occult and never manifest clinically. Where the disease does advance it becomes one of the top three most common causes of death from cancer in men alongside lung cancer and colorectal cancer. Serum Prostatic Specific Antigen (PSA) levels have been used in prostate cancer screening since the 1990s.
  Gleason score
This is formed by identifying the most common cell morphology and second most common cell morphology. The different morphologies are compared to a five-point graded system and the two grades added together to give the final score (i.e. 4+2, 5+3 etc.). If there is only one cell morphology the score can be e.g. 3+3. Prostate cancer is defined by a minimum total grading of 6 (usually 3+3).
  MRI is crucial to provide accurate staging but is also gaining in momentum on its way to becoming a screening tool in its own right.
The majority of prostate cancers arise from the peripheral zone and causes the normally high T2 signal to become low signal. Additionally, the cancer should show restriction in diffusion (i.e. high signal on DWI, correspondingly low on ADC). It is important to view the T1 images as well in order to exclude the possibility of haemorrhage which can sometimes look like a prostate cancer on the T2 weighted images.",FALSE,"I chose this answer because DWI B1200 is a type of MRI scan that can be used to identify areas of cancer in the prostate. It works by detecting changes in the movement of water molecules in the prostate tissue. Cancer cells tend to have lower signal on DWI B1200 because they are less able to move water molecules than healthy cells. Therefore, a low signal on DWI B1200 is an indication of the presence of prostate cancer.",1,"3. A question about interpreting/evaluating data?

3. A question about interpreting/evaluating data?",C,TRUE,"I chose option 4, ""Low ADC,"" because it is the most indicative of the presence of prostate cancer on MRI. 

ADC stands for Apparent Diffusion Coefficient, which is a measure derived from diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) sequences in MRI. It quantifies the degree of water molecule diffusion within tissues. In prostate cancer, the tumor cells are typically more densely packed, which restricts the diffusion of water molecules. This restriction results in a lower ADC value compared to normal prostate tissue.

Low ADC values are therefore associated with higher cellularity and are more suggestive of prostate cancer. The other options mentioned, such as high signal DWI B0, low signal on DWI B1200, high T2 signal, and high T1 signal, are not as specific or indicative of prostate cancer as a low ADC value.",A,TRUE,A
10476,205045,A CT scan shows a nodule in a large cavity. This is more likely to be malignant under which of the following circumstances?,SBA: Cardiothoracic and vascular,Enhancement of a mural nodule,Dependant nodule,Atelectasis,Volume loss in lower lobe,Bronchiectasis,A,92%,1%,2%,4%,1%,"Explanation:
The main cavitating neoplastic culprits are:
Bronchogenic carcinoma (Squamous cell carcinoma)
Metastatic squamous cell carcinoma
Adenocarcinoma (Colon + breast)
Contrast enhancement in a nodule is a strong indicator of malignancy and vice versa is also true; the absence of contrast enhancement strongly suggests a nodule is benign. True dependancy (on both supine and prone scans) would be suggestive of aspergilloma formation. Volume loss suggests fibrosis. Atelectasis has many causes and is more often seen in benign disease than as a consequence of neoplasia. Bronchiectasis implies chronicity and is not linked to malignancy (with the exception of post-radiotherapy change).",FALSE,"A dependent nodule is more likely to be malignant because it is located in a large cavity, which is an area that is prone to cancerous growths. The other conditions are not as likely to be malignant.",2,"This question falls under category 2: A question about clinical judgement, what is the correct diagnosis?",B,TRUE,"I chose option 1, ""Enhancement of a mural nodule,"" because the enhancement of a nodule in a CT scan can be an important sign of malignancy. Enhancement refers to the increased visibility of a nodule after the administration of a contrast agent, which helps to differentiate the tissue from its surroundings. Malignant tumors often have increased blood supply, leading to a higher uptake of the contrast agent and a more pronounced enhancement. This can be an indication of the aggressive nature of the tumor and its potential to invade surrounding tissues.

The other options are less indicative of malignancy:
2. Dependant nodule: Nodules that are dependent on the position of the patient are less likely to be malignant and may represent benign processes like mucus plugs or blood clots.
3. Atelectasis: Atelectasis is a collapse of lung tissue, which can be caused by various factors such as obstruction, compression, or scarring. Although it can be associated with lung cancer, it is not directly indicative of malignancy.
4. Volume loss in lower lobe: Volume loss can be caused by various factors, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), fibrosis, and infection. While it can be associated with lung cancer, it is not a specific sign of malignancy.
5. Bronchiectasis: Bronchiectasis is a chronic lung condition characterized by the abnormal dilation of bronchi, often due to infection or inflammation. It is not directly indicative of malignancy.",A,FALSE,D
14371,205045,"A 3-year-old boy is reviewed in clinic. He has been diagnosed with heterotaxy, following closure of a large ASD closed shortly after birth. Which of the following describes the most likely features of his condition? Select ONE answer only.",SBA: Paediatrics,"Bilobed lungs, polysplenia, midline liver position","Trilobed lungs, asplenia, midline liver position","Bilobed lungs, polyplenia, normal liver position","Trilobed lungs, asplenia, normal liver position","Trilobed lungs, polysplenia, normal liver position",A,43%,22%,9%,20%,6%,"Explanation:
The patient most likely has polysplenia. It is uncommon for patients with asplenia to reach the age of 3 as almost all of them have TAPVR. ASD is a much more common finding with polysplenia.
  Heterotaxy
There are two main forms of this congenital disorder:
Left sided isomerism (polysplenia)
Things that would usually be found on the left side are duplicated on the right side too. The most consistent features are the abnormalities of the spleen and IVC. The other features are commonly associated, but variably seen. The prognosis is slightly better than for asplenia syndrome as there is a lower association with congenital heart disease. There is still 75% mortality by age 5 though.
Spleen - multiple little spleens
IVC - interrupted IVC with azygos or hemiazygos continuation
Lung lobes - two on either side
Liver - situated centrally in the abdomen
Bowel - malrotation
Pancreas - truncated
Heart - ASD, VSD, PAPVR (less severe congenital heart disease)
  Right sided isomerism (asplenia)
Things that would normally be found on the right side are duplicated on the left side too. Strong association with severe congenital heart disease means the condition has a mortality rate of 80% by age 1. Beyond that, the most consistent feature is the absence of the spleen. Once again, the other features are commonly associated, but variably demonstrated.
Heart - TAPVR and other anomalies (Almost 100% have severe cyanotic congenital heart disease)
Spleen - absent
Lung lobes - three on either side (specific finding)
Liver - normal position (can be midline or malpositioned)
Bowel - malrotation
IVC - on same side as aorta (usually the right)
Kidneys - associated with horseshoe kidney
 ",FALSE,"I chose 3 because heterotaxy is a condition in which the internal organs are abnormally arranged in the chest and abdomen. This can include trilobed lungs, asplenia (absence of the spleen), and a normal liver position.",1,"3. A question about the application of knowledge, how to interpret a set of clinical findings?

This question falls under option 3: A question about the application of knowledge, how to interpret a set of clinical findings.",B,TRUE,"I chose option 1 because it best describes the most likely features of heterotaxy in a 3-year-old boy who had a large atrial septal defect (ASD) closed shortly after birth. Heterotaxy is a rare congenital disorder characterized by abnormal arrangement of internal thoracic-abdominal organs across the left-right axis of the body.

Option 1 describes bilobed lungs, polysplenia (multiple spleens), and a midline liver position, which are common features of heterotaxy. In particular, the presence of polysplenia is often associated with left isomerism, which can be seen in heterotaxy syndrome.

The other options do not accurately represent the typical features of heterotaxy:
- Option 2: Trilobed lungs and asplenia are not commonly associated with heterotaxy.
- Option 3: Bilobed lungs and polyplenia are consistent with heterotaxy, but the normal liver position is not.
- Option 4: Trilobed lungs, asplenia, and normal liver position are not typical features of heterotaxy.
- Option 5: Trilobed lungs and normal liver position are not commonly associated with heterotaxy, although polysplenia is.

Therefore, option 1 is the most accurate description of the likely features of this patient's heterotaxy condition.",A,TRUE,A
14274,205045,You are performing a contrast enhanced ultrasound scan on a patient. There is a 3cm lesion in the left lobe of the liver. Which of the following is INCORRECTLY matched with its likely diagnosis? Select ONE answer only.,SBA: Gastrointestinal,Peripheral nodular enhancement with gradual filling in - flash haemangioma,Immediate uniform enhancement which washes out - malignant lesion,Spoke wheel enhancement of a central scar - fibrous nodular hyperplasia,Gradual uniform enhancement - benign lesion,Arterial enhancement with a non-enhancing central scar - fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma,A,74%,5%,5%,9%,6%,"Explanation:
Please note that the question asks which answer is INCORRECTLY matched.
The correct pairings are as follows:
Immediate uniform enhancement which does not wash out - flash haemangioma
Immediate uniform enhancement which washes out - malignant lesion
Peripheral nodular enhancement with gradual filling in - haemangioma
Spoke wheel enhancement of a central scar - fibrous nodular hyperplasia
Gradual uniform enhancement - benign lesion
Arterial enhancement with a non-enhancing central scar - fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma
  Contrast enhanced ultrasound (CEUS)
CEUS is cheaper than MRI and confers less risk to the patient. The patient is injected with a contrast agent consisting of tiny microbubbles measuring micrometers in diameter. These circulate within the patient and when insonated cause strong reflections which show up as hyperechogenicity in real time as the bubbles wash in and out of the field of view. The microbubbles burst in time and the process can be repeated within a few minutes if required. There is no renal toxicity and adverse reactions are very rare meaning this is a safe procedure for almost all patients. The most significant limitation is the location of the lesion; if the lesion cannot be seen with B-mode ultrasound then it cannot be interrogated with CEUS.
It is a useful technique particularly for differentiating between malignant lesions (which tend to washout rapidly owing to their high vascularity), and benign lesions but is also useful for characterising benign lesions such as haemangiomata or focal nodular hyperplasia by demonstrating the same enhancement patterns which would otherwise be expected on an MRI.
The technique, having been developed with liver lesions in mind, is now being expanded to renal lesions, testicular masses and vascular work too, among others.
As a general rule, if the lesion can be seen on ultrasound, it can be investigated with CEUS however lesions smaller than 10mm are often challenging in this regard. In any case, an anechoic lesion (i.e. a cyst) needs no further investigation. Lesions close to the diaphragm (Segments VII and VIII in particular) are difficult to see with ultrasound at the best of times.",FALSE,The correct match for arterial enhancement with a non-enhancing central scar is hepatocellular adenoma.

13849,205045,A 20-year-old gymnast twists his knee after landing from a jump and suffers a meniscal tear. You are asked to review his MRI scan. Which SINGLE statement regarding the menisci of the knee is FALSE?,SBA: Musculoskeletal and Trauma,The lateral meniscus is fixed to the joint capsule and non-mobile,The lateral meniscus is attached at both ends to the intercondylar area of the tibia,Both menisci are C shaped,The medial meniscus is attached to the medial collateral ligament,They deepen the articular surface of the tibia,A,65%,16%,9%,7%,4%,"Explanation:
The menisci of the knee are two pads of fibrocartilaginous tissue, which have two main functions:
They deepen the articular surface of the tibia and increase stability of the knee joint
To disperse friction between the femur and tibia, acting as ‘shock absorbers’
  Both menisci are C shaped and are attached at both ends to the intercondylar area of the tibia.
The medial meniscus is also fixed to the medial collateral ligament and the joint capsule. As a consequence of this injuries to the medial collateral ligament are often accompanied by a tear of the medial meniscus. The lateral meniscus is smaller and does not have any extra attachments, rendering it fairly mobile.
  The head of the tibia from above, showing the menisci and ligament attachments (from Gray’s Anatomy)",FALSE,"The menisci of the knee are not C-shaped. They are U-shaped, with the medial meniscus being more circular and the lateral meniscus being more crescent-shaped.",1,"This question falls under category 1: Basic factual recall, either of basic science, physics, anatomy or regarding a procedure.",D,TRUE,"I chose option 1 because it is the false statement among the given options. The lateral meniscus is actually more mobile than the medial meniscus, as it is not directly attached to the joint capsule. This increased mobility allows the lateral meniscus to better accommodate the movement of the knee joint during various activities.

14217,205045,A 1-year-old girl is brought to the Emergency Department by her parents. She has severe abdominal tenderness and distension. Ultrasound demonstrates an ileocolic intussusception. She is brought round to the radiology department for an attempt at reduction by fluoroscopically guided air enema. Which of the following steps is best to reduce the dose to the patient? Select ONE answer only.,SBA: Paediatrics,Remove the grid,Large FOV,Continuous fluoroscopy mode,Increase magnification,Reduce collimation,A,80%,2%,1%,6%,11%,"Explanation:
Grids
An anti-scatter grid is useful for patients heavier than around 20kg (about age 4-5) when scatter from within the patient reduces the image quality but, especially for patients smaller than this, the grid only serves to increase the patient dose (by only allowing direct photons through, a greater number of photons must be supplied to create the resultant image). Without any numbers or calculations to perform it is difficult to compare the effects of grid removal and field of view however in this patient the grid should definitely not be used as the patient is too small.
  Magnification and FOV
Image magnification can be achieved either via geometric or electronic means. Geometric magnification reduces patient dose by moving the patient further away from the radiation source however the further the patient is from the source, the greater the blurring effect of any patient (or bowel, or respiratory) motion. Electronic magnification is also called changing the field of view (think of this like zooming) and increasing the FOV does reduce the dose, but at the expense of image sharpness. The dose saving can be significant owing to the inverse square law.
  Collimation
Collimating the x-ray beam involves using lead shielding to concentrate the x-ray beam onto the target area (think of this like cropping). It is important to avoid irradiating tissue which is not required for diagnosis but also reduces operator dose by reducing scatter from the irradiated patient. This may be challenging in a paediatric intussusception scan as it relies on the patient lying still within the target area.
  Continuous vs pulsed
Continuous fluoroscopy mode (as opposed to pulsed fluoroscopy) involves, as the name suggests, imaging continuously as opposed to taking an image at pulsed intervals which involves far less dose. Moving objects are also better imaged with pulsed mode as there can be significant blurring when using continuous fluoroscopy.",FALSE,I chose 3 because increasing the magnification will reduce the dose to the patient by decreasing the amount of radiation that is scattered and increasing the focus of the beam. This will result in a more precise image with less radiation exposure for the patient.,1,3. A question that requires analysis of a clinical scenario.,A,TRUE,"I chose option 1, ""Remove the grid,"" because removing the grid can help reduce the radiation dose to the patient. The grid is used to reduce scatter radiation and improve image quality. However, in pediatric patients, especially in a 1-year-old girl, the amount of scatter radiation is relatively low due to their small size. By removing the grid, less radiation is needed to create an image, thus reducing the overall dose to the patient without significantly compromising image quality. This is important in pediatric patients, as they are more sensitive to radiation and its potential long-term effects.",A,TRUE,A
10031,205045,A 53-year-old man collides with one of the hurdles during his son’s sports day. Two months later he is still noticing a lump around the distal femur and undergoes an x-ray. There is a well defined partly calcified soft tissue mass underlying the tender area. There is cortical erosion of the underlying bone. What is the most likely diagnosis?,SBA: Musculoskeletal and Trauma,Malignant fibrous histiocytoma,Myositis ossificans,Tumoral calcinosis,Gout,Osteosarcoma,A,41%,39%,7%,1%,12%,"Explanation:
Malignant fibrous histiocytoma (MFH) - more recently referred to as Undifferentiated Pleomorphic Sarcoma (UPS)
A soft-tissue MFH is the most common subtype of MFHs and the most common malignant primary soft tissue tumour in the over 50s age bracket. It usually presents as a painless soft tissue mass which enlarges over a matter of months. They can be large at the time of diagnosis measuring tens of centimetres. On x-ray they appear as a partly calcified soft tissue mass. Cortical erosion of the underlying bone is an important diagnostic feature. On MRI it returns high signal on both T1 and T2 weighted sequences.
  Myositis ossificans
Trauma to the muscle causes local haemorrhage and necrosis of damaged muscle. The sequelae of this is calcification which can persist long-term. Large muscles are particularly prone to this and the typical patient is a young, active adolescent. Myositis ossificans appears as a calcified soft tissue mass underlying the area of clinical concern. A periosteal reaction may or may not be present but crucially there is no erosion of the underlying cortex, a fact which discriminates it from malignant fibrous histiocytoma. The string sign refers to the presence of a plane of normal tissue separating the mass from the bone and unlike a parosteal osteosarcoma, in myositis ossificans this plane will extend along the whole length of the mass completely separating it from the bone.
  Tumoral calcinosis
Surprisingly for the sometimes extreme appearance of this condition, it can be completely painless. Patients are typically black and in their teens or 20s. Around a third of cases are inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion. A biochemical defect in the metabolism of phosphorus leads to accumulation of hydroxyapatite fluid around the joints causing a foreign-body type granulomatous reaction and fibrous capsule development. On imaging this appears as a progressive and calcified soft tissue mass. The skin overlying the mass can ulcerate and exude a chalky or milk like fluid. Any or all of the hips, shoulders and elbows can be affected but characteristically tumoral calcinosis does not affect the knees. Importantly the underlying bones are normal, a feature which differentiates it from gout or pseudogout.
  Gout
Excess circulating urate levels leads to crystalisation of urate (monosodium urate crystals) within the joint spaces. An acute attack may be precipitated by any acute event such as trauma or surgery as well as a change in diet to include purine containing foods (liver, kidney, game meat, some seafood, alcohol). Historically chronic manifestations of this condition included the development of gouty tophi; white lumpy areas under the skin which could ulcerate and exude a chalky material. These are still seen today but far less so thanks to improved management strategies. Involvement of the first metatarsophalangeal joint is considered classical but involvement of the carpometacarpal joints of the hands is often most debilitating where it occurs. On x-ray the earliest radiological manifestation is a joint effusion. Joint erosions develop on the lateral corners of a joint but contrary to many other erosive processes the base of the ulcers has a sclerotic margin. Juxta-articular osteopenia is not often seen, a feature which acts as a good distinguisher from rheumatoid arthritis, which is thought to be because the attacks come in acute bursts during which time disuse osteopenia does not have the time to develop. Another reasonably specific feature of gouty arthritis is the preservation of the joint space itself until relatively late into the disease.

  These are bone forming tumours which can either be primary, or secondary. Primary osteosarcomas occur in young patients or young adults when the bones are more active during adolescence than in later life, and have a predilection for either the proximal tibia or distal femur i.e. around the knee joint. Secondary osteosarcomas occur as malignant degeneration of pre-existing bone lesions. Clinically they present as a painful mass with a fever. Pain on movement is also typical. In later disease patients may have a raised serum ALP. On x-ray they are poorly defined aggressive lesions with sunburst periosteal reaction and fluffy cloud-like osseous matrix. For staging the patient should receive an MRI of the entire of the affected bone (to rule out synchronous lesions), a nuclear medicine bone scan and a CT chest. Tissue biopsy should only be performed at tertiary referral centres where to mitigate the risk of seeding the biopsy tract, immediate tissue analysis with the option of immediate amputation can be performed.
In the case of a parosteal osteosarcoma, the attachment to the underlying bone may be thin and stalk-like but will be present. Depending on the view a radiolucent plane may seem present for some of the length of the tumour, giving rise to ‘string sign’ appearance, but an attachment to the parent bone will be present.

Telangiectatic
Purely lytic, poor prognosis, fluid-fluid levels

Ages 5-10 with very poor prognosis",FALSE,"Myositis ossificans is the most likely diagnosis because it is a condition in which soft tissue, usually muscle, is replaced by bone. It is usually caused by a traumatic injury, such as a collision with a hurdle, and is characterized by a well-defined, partly calcified soft tissue mass underlying the tender area and cortical erosion of the underlying bone, which are both seen in the x-ray.",2,,E,FALSE,"I chose option 2, Myositis ossificans, because the patient's history and the x-ray findings are consistent with this condition. Myositis ossificans is a benign, self-limiting condition in which a soft tissue injury, such as a contusion or muscle strain, leads to the formation of bone within the affected muscle or soft tissue. This can occur after a trauma, like the collision with a hurdle in this case.

The x-ray findings of a well-defined, partly calcified soft tissue mass with underlying cortical erosion are also suggestive of myositis ossificans. Over time, the mass becomes more calcified and may resemble bone.

The other options are less likely given the patient's history and x-ray findings:

1. Malignant fibrous histiocytoma is a rare soft tissue sarcoma that would typically present with a rapidly growing mass, and the history of trauma is not consistent with this diagnosis.

3. Tumoral calcinosis is a rare condition characterized by the deposition of calcium in periarticular soft tissues, usually around large joints such as the hip, shoulder, or elbow. The history of trauma and the location of the mass are not consistent with this diagnosis.

4. Gout is an inflammatory arthritis caused by the deposition of monosodium urate crystals in joints and soft tissues. While it can cause soft tissue masses, the history of trauma and the x-ray findings are not typical for gout.

5. Osteosarcoma is a primary malignant bone tumor. Although it can involve the distal femur, the history of trauma and the well-defined, partly calcified soft tissue mass are not characteristic of osteosarcoma.",B,FALSE,C

Please note that the question asks for the answer which is NOT correct.
The anatomy of the middle ear is complex but important and contains a number of specific anatomical terms.
  Image © Medical Exam Prep
  The epitympanum, also known as the attic, is the superior portion above the highest point of the tympanic membrane. It contains the head of the malleus and the short crus of the incus (These give the appearance of an ice-cream cone on an axial CT).
  Image © Medical Exam Prep
  The Prussak space is found within the epitympanum and is a tiny space at the top of the tympanic membrane, just behind the scutum. Its clinical relevance is that it is the usual origin for pars flaccida cholesteatomas.
The aditus ad antrum connects the epitympanum to the mastoid antrum and thence the mastoid air cells.
The tegmen mastoidium (tegmen means roof) is the point at which the mastoid air cells meet the temporal lobe of the brain.
The tegmen tympani is the point at which the upper most extent of the epitympanum reaches the temporal lobe of the brain.
    Image © Medical Exam Prep
  The mesotympanum is the space posterior to the tympanic membrane and contains the body of the incus, the manubrium (connected to the tympanic membrane) and the anterior process of the malleus and the stapes. The stapes is connected to the incus as well as the oval window of the cochlea. There is also a round window placed more inferiorly which bulges to allow compression waves transmitted from the stapes to the oval window to travel through the cochlea.
The hypotympanum is a far less significant space than either the epitympanum or the mesotympanum. It begins at the inferior most extent of the tympanic membrane. The Eustachian tube opens into the hypotympanum anteriorly.",FALSE,"I chose number 3 because the head of the malleus is situated in the epitympanum, not the tympanic membrane. The incus is connected to the tympanic membrane, the stapes is connected to the oval window of the cochlea, and the stapes is situated in the mesotympanum. The Prussak space is found behind the superior part of the tympanic membrane.",1,"This question falls under category 1: Basic factual recall, either of basic science, physics, anatomy or regarding a procedure.",C,TRUE,"I chose option 2 because it states that ""The incus is connected to the tympanic membrane,"" which is not correct.

9986,205045,A 45-year-old man with back pain is found to have marked calcification and loss of height in the intervertebral discs of the lumbar spine. There is pronounced chondrocalcinosis and x-rays of his hands show advanced osteoarthritic changes. What is the most likely diagnosis?,SBA: Musculoskeletal and Trauma,Alkaptonuria,Haemochromatosis,Wilson disease,Calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease,Enteropathic arthropathy,A,49%,9%,2%,38%,2%,"Explanation:
Alkaptonuria also known as ochronosis
This condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. It is caused by excessive circulating levels of homogentisic acid (HGA) when the enzyme which would usually degrade it is deficient. HGA has an affinity for collagen and accumulates in the connective tissues throughout the body. In visible light HGA has a blackish colour and thus the disease can be diagnosed in infancy when a baby’s nappies are stained black by the presence of HGA in the urine. By the time patients reach their 20s pigmentation may be visible in their skin, particularly the ears. This is initially a dark yellow colour (hence the term ochronosis, from ‘Ochre’ in Greek meaning a dark yellow colour) but can progress to blue-grey and black.
In imaging chondrocalcinosis is the most prominent feature, with calcification and destruction of the intervertebral discs. Premature osteoarthritic changes to the hands, feet, shoulders, hips and knees will also develop as the collagen deteriorates. Deposition in the heart and kidneys too leads to cardiac and renal failure.
  Haemochromatosis
The primary version of this disease can be inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion. Excess dietary iron is absorbed and this accumulates in all tissues of the body leading to various different problems.
Secondary haemochromatosis can arise if patients receive numerous blood transfusions without sufficient chelation to mitigate against the iron overload.
Cirrhosis – the presence of the excess iron in the liver leads to unusual signal properties on an MRI scan. Iron is paramagnetic and causes spin dephasing. T2* and T2 sequences are particularly vulnerable to this effect but lower than expected signal will be seen on all sequences. Importantly the signal from the spleen and bone marrow should be normal. By contrast they will be involved in cases of transfusional siderosis.
Generalised osteoporosis
Hook like osteophytes on the radial aspect of the metacarpal heads – these are highly characteristic
Chondrocalcinosis, particularly affecting the knees
Insulin dependent diabetes
Congestive cardiomyopathy
Skin pigmentation
  Calcium pyrophosphate dehydrate disease (CPPD) also known as pseudogout
CPPD can present in an acute or subacute fashion but is also seen as a chronic cause of joint inflammation. It may be misdiagnosed as simple osteoarthritis owing to its often bilateral and symmetrical distribution but there are also a couple of areas of the body which can be affected in particular, and which would be unusual for isolated degenerative changes.
The patellofemoral joint – joint space loss here can be extremely striking with almost complete preservation of the joint space at the medial and lateral compartments of the knee
Triangular fibrocartilaginous complex of the wrist – calcification
Radiocarpal joints – degenerative changes without involvement of the DIPs and PIPs
  Wilson disease
Inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion, this disease results from an excess of copper within the body due to the inability of the liver to excrete it. It can present in childhood with cirrhosis but later presentations are more likely to be due to the neuropsychiatric manifestations. Clinically adolescent or adult patients develop tremor and dysarthria due to copper deposition in the lentiform nucleus. The classic diagnostic feature is Kayser-Fleischer pigment rings in the eyes. Radiologically the following features can be seen:
Hepatic manifestations: The liver appears normal on MRI since fatty infiltration effectively cancels out the paramagnetic effects of copper
Musculoskeletal manifestations: Generalised osteoporosis, subarticular cysts, chondrocalcinosis and arthropathy which can mimic CPPD
CNS manifestations: White matter atrophy and T2 hyperintensities predominantly affecting the basal ganglia and thalami. T1 signal is also high in these areas, differentiating it from many of the other basal ganglia disorders. There is a classical feature of ‘sparing of the red nucleus’ leading to an appearance known as the giant panda sign at the level of the pons.
  Enteropathic arthropathy
Sacroiliitis and spondylitis are the hallmarks of enteropathic arthropathy. It is an important seronegative spondyloarthropathy. Outside of the axial skeleton, other features common to all seronegative spondyloarthropathies are also found. These include arthritis in the hands and feet, uveitis, and enthesitis (especially calcaneal). Interestingly although it is most commonly discussed in relation to Crohn’s disease and Ulcerative Colitis, only 5 and 10% respectively of patients with these conditions will develop enteropathic arthropathy. By contrast of patients with Whipple disease, around 75-90% of them will suffer from enteropathic arthropathy. Infection with Salmonella, Shigella and Yersinia are also known associations.",FALSE,"I chose this answer because calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease is a common cause of back pain in middle-aged adults, and is characterized by calcification and loss of height in the intervertebral discs of the lumbar spine, as well as pronounced chondrocalcinosis and advanced osteoarthritic changes in the hands.",2,,D,FALSE,"I chose option 4, Calcium Pyrophosphate Deposition Disease (CPPD), because the symptoms and findings described in the question align with this condition. The marked calcification and loss of height in the intervertebral discs, as well as pronounced chondrocalcinosis, are indicative of CPPD. This disease is characterized by the deposition of calcium pyrophosphate crystals in the joints, which can lead to joint pain, inflammation, and degeneration, such as the advanced osteoarthritic changes observed in the patient's hands. The other options do not fit the described symptoms as closely as CPPD does.",D,TRUE,A

He is hypotensive and tachycardic but sufficiently stable for a CT scan which shows a large retroperitoneal haematoma and a low attenuation lesion within the kidney. He is taken for embolisation and, on entry, the initial angiogram demonstrates microaneurysms within the lesion. What is the most likely diagnosis?","SBA: Genito urinary, Adrenal, Obstetrics & Gynaecology and Breast",AML (angiomyolipoma),RCC,TCC,SCC,Oncocytoma,A,91%,4%,1%,0%,4%,"Explanation:
Angiomyolipoma (AML)
These are benign tumours which occur within the kidney and characteristically contain fat on CT scan. On an MRI scan they return high signal on both T1 and T2 and classically show signal drop-out on gradient echo sequences. They are usually small and harmless but occasionally can bleed into the retroperitoneum causing haemorrhagic shock (Wunderlich syndrome). This is more likely to occur the larger the AML due to the presence of microaneurysms. Those > 4 cm can be considered for resection or embolisation. Tuberous sclerosis is strongly associated with multiple angiomyolipomata which can be both large and numerous. Other phakomatoses such as Neurofibromatosis type 1 (not type 2) and von Hippel Lindau are also associated with AMLs to a lesser degree, as is polycystic kidney disease.
  Transitional cell carcinoma (TCC)
Bladder TCCs are very common but renal TCCs less so. Nonetheless they have a knack for appearing in multiple locations at once and thus careful evaluation of the upper tracts is necessary each time a new diagnosis of bladder TCC is made. They appear as filling defects on the excretory phase of a CT scan or IVU.
  Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC)
This is an ‘also-ran’ malignancy of the urinary tract accounting for 1% of kidney tumours. Clinically it will present in a similar fashion with haematuria however on CT there is no mass lesions to be seen as the SCC infiltrates the renal parenchyma causing renal enlargement with preservation of the overall kidney shape.
  Oncocytoma
Oncocytomas have a characteristic feature of a stellate spoke wheel vascular pattern with an enhancing central scar. In reality there is so much overlap between the features of these tumours, which are largely benign, and renal cell carcinomas, that oncocytomas must be resected for histological confirmation of the diagnosis. They can present at any age but are usually asymptomatic, despite often being very large. In the real world they can engulf the perinephric fat and confusingly come to resemble an AML which is unhelpful.
  Renal cell carcinoma (RCC)
This is the most common kidney tumour, accounting for around 80%. Patients are usually in their 50-70s although there is an increased incidence in dialysis patients and those with von Hippel Lindau. Clinically there is a classically macroscopic haematuria. A quarter or patients develop a paraneoplastic syndrome such as:
Hypercalcaemia
Polycythaemia due to erythropoietin
Stauffer syndrome (hepatomegaly without hepatic metastasis)
Limbic encephalitis
A renal protocol CT is used to evaluate lesions found on ultrasound and includes an unenhanced phase, a 60 second (corticomedullary) phase, and a 100 second (nephrogenic) phase. An excretory phase at 15 minutes can also be performed if evaluation of the collecting system anatomy is required (e.g. if the patient is a candidate for a partial nephrectomy). There are a number of different histological subtypes which are simplified and summarised in the table below:
  Histology
Prevalence
Associations
Clear cell renal carcinoma
75%
Von Hippel Lindau syndrome
Papillary renal cell carcinoma
15%
Most strongly associated with dialysis patients. Better prognosis than clear cell (if diagnosed prior to metastasis).

12356,205045,A 32-year-old woman who delivered a healthy baby two days previously in an uncomplicated normal vaginal delivery has an MRI pituitary which shows an area of high T1 signal in the suprasellar and sellar region. What is the most likely diagnosis?,SBA: Central Nervous and Head & Neck,Bleed without adenoma,Pineoblastoma,Craniopharyngioma,Bleeding into macroadenoma,Atrophic pituitary,D,37%,1%,4%,55%,3%,"Explanation:
This patient has haemorrhaged into the pituitary gland (as evidenced by the high T1 signal). Sheehan syndrome is consequent on obstetric hypovolaemia which is excluded by the description of an uncomplicated normal vaginal delivery. It is therefore more likely that she has undergone spontaneous pituitary apoplexy (and that the pregnancy is a red herring) ie bleeding into a macroadenoma.
  Pituitary apoplexy
Pathologically, pituitary apoplexy is infarction which can take place with or without haemorrhage. Over half of patients have an underlying macroadenoma; haemorrhage into a pre-existing macroadenoma is the usual presentation. 'All' patients present with a headache and panhypopituitarism. Visual impairment is also common as the pituitary enlarges and impacts on the chiasm. On a CT scan there will be a sellar/suprasellar mass (ie pituitary enlargement). Hyperdensity is caused by the underlying haemorrhage, if present. On an MRI, the pituitary can be seen to be enlarged with T1 hyperintensity (specifically in the subacute phases). In the chronic phase however, the pituitary will be involuted and small, even appearing as an 'empty sella'.
  Sheehan syndrome is pituitary apoplexy due to hypovolaemic shock and can be consequential to delivery. At the time of apoplexy, the predominant issue for the patient is the systemic hypovolaemia for which aggressive management is usually already being pursued. In the early days following the delivery, the first hypopituitary issues to manifest is usually any or all of hyponatraemia, diabetes insipidus or hypothyroidism. At this time the MRI findings can vary from a normal appearing pituitary through to the classic pituitary apoplexy appearances of an enlarged pituitary with high T1 signal. Patients can also present many months or years later with panhypoituitarism at which time an MRI will usually show an empty sella.
 ",FALSE,"Craniopharyngioma is the most likely diagnosis because it is the most common type of pituitary tumor found in this region. It is typically slow-growing and benign, and can cause symptoms such as headaches, vision problems, and hormone imbalances. An MRI can reveal a high T1 signal in the suprasellar and sellar region, which is consistent with a craniopharyngioma.",2,,C,FALSE,"I chose option 1, ""Bleed without adenoma,"" as the most likely diagnosis because the patient is a 32-year-old woman who recently delivered a healthy baby through an uncomplicated normal vaginal delivery.

In some cases, this can lead to a condition called postpartum pituitary hemorrhage or Sheehan's syndrome, where there is bleeding in the pituitary gland without the presence of an adenoma (a benign tumor).

The MRI findings of high T1 signal in the suprasellar and sellar region are consistent with hemorrhage, making option 1 the most plausible diagnosis given the patient's recent childbirth. The other options (pineoblastoma, craniopharyngioma, and bleeding into macroadenoma) are less likely given the patient's clinical history and the MRI findings.

9236,205045,A 43-year-old lady undergoes a routine laparoscopic cholecystectomy for the management of her long-standing gallstone pain. She recovers well and is discharged home on day 4. Three days later she comes back to hospital and is seen in the A+E department complaining of ongoing abdominal pain and abdominal fullness. She undergoes a CT scan which shows a large volume of intraperitoneal fluid measuring 10HU. What should the radiologist suggest next?,SBA: Gastrointestinal,MRI with gadoxetic acid disodium (Primovist),Contrast enhanced ultrasound,Expectant management,Arterial phase CT,MRI with gadodiamide (Omniscan),A,72%,1%,14%,6%,7%,"Explanation:
It is sometimes difficult on CT to prove that intra-abdominal fluid is bile. Distinguishing it from post-op fluid collections in particular may be challenging. Usually bile measures around 0-10HU and often its copious nature points to the diagnosis since the liver produces a surprisingly large volume of bile each day.
Gadoxetic acid disodium (Primovist) and gadobentate disodium (MultiHance) are hepatobiliary specific MRI contrast agents. Since it is excreted by hepatocytes it is removed from the body in bile and thus can be exceedingly useful in diagnosing a bile leak. A hepatobiliary phase scan at around 20 minutes for Primovist or 100 minutes for MultiHance can provide the diagnosis in many such cases.
CT cholangiography is possible using meglumine iotroxate (Biliscopin) which is excreted by the liver but has the obvious disadvantage of added radiation dose. The contrast agent is also less widely available than Primovist or MultiHance are.
Vicarious excretion of water-soluble contrast material does occur via the hepatic route. It can sometimes be seen in cases of renal failure or obstruction and may also occur on CT scans taken 1-2 days after a previous CT scan in otherwise healthy patients.",FALSE,"Contrast enhanced ultrasound is the best option for further evaluation of the intraperitoneal fluid in this case. Contrast-enhanced ultrasound can provide detailed information about the size, shape, and location of the fluid, as well as its composition. It can also provide information about the vascularity of the fluid, which can help to differentiate between benign and malignant processes. Additionally, contrast-enhanced ultrasound can help to identify any associated complications such as abscess formation or biliary obstruction.",3,"3. A question about the application of knowledge, what is the best course of action?",B,FALSE,"I chose option 2, expectant management, because the CT scan showed a large volume of intraperitoneal fluid with a Hounsfield unit (HU) measurement of 10HU.

Myelolipoma is a benign tumour with large areas of fat within it. Only about ¼ have calcification. On MRI, myeloid is seen as focal areas of low T1 signal. The lesions are present with retroperitoneal haemorrhage. They are associated with endocrine disorders, such as Cushing’s and Conn’s disease, but do not cause them.
With any lesion on an MRI scan the key to diagnosis lies in determining the tissue content. Try to decide if a lesion contains fat, fluid, blood or all three by going through the tissue types one by one.
Each different sequence helps to eliminate/rule-in the different tissue types.
Blood - high on T1 and does not suppress on T1 fat saturated sequences (e.g. the precontrast sequence)
Fluid - high on T2. Compare with known fluid filled organs such as the bladder for pelvic scans and the gallbladder for upper abdominal scans. If the target lesion is fluid, it should not just be slightly high on T2 but should be as high as these reference organs.

The other options are less likely based on the imaging findings.",2,,B,TRUE,"I chose Myelolipoma as the most likely diagnosis because the imaging findings described in the question are consistent with this type of adrenal lesion. A Myelolipoma is a benign, non-functioning adrenal tumor that is composed of adipose (fat) tissue and hematopoietic (blood-forming) elements. 

The ultrasound finding of a heterogeneous but predominantly echogenic lesion is suggestive of a mix of adipose and soft tissue components. On MRI, the hyperintense areas on T1-weighted images are indicative of the presence of fat, while the signal drop-out on out-of-phase imaging further supports the presence of microscopic fat within the lesion.

Nocardia
This is a rare infection which occurs particularly in bone marrow transplant patients as well as those with AIDs. Lobar consolidation and nodules with cavitation are seen but lymph node enlargement is notably absent.
  CMV infection
An opportunistic infection, CMV is seen in immunocompromised patients, most commonly those with AIDs. Small nodules with patchy ground glass opacification is seen on CT. It is also included in the differential diagnosis for the tree-in-bud appearance but as such it is unusual because the luminal opacification is derived from bronchial wall thickening as opposed to an exogenous substance. Changes are usually widespread; there is no particular predilection for the middle lobe.
  Aspergillosis
Aspergillosis is an all encompassing term which refers to the spectrum of lung diseases caused by the fungus Aspergillus. How the fungus affects the patient depends on their underlying immune status.
Severely immunocompromised patients                        → Invasive aspergillosis
Mildly immunocompromised patients                            → semi-invasive aspergillosis
Normal patients                                                                   → non-invasive aspergillosis (such as colonization of a pre-existing cyst or cavity)
Hypersensitive patients (Cystic fibrosis or asthmatics) → Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA)
  The halo sign is used to describe the appearance of a nodule surrounded by a ‘halo’ of ground glass opacification. It occurs when there is alveolar haemorrhage and is considered to be a classical finding in invasive aspergillosis.
  Graft vs Host disease
When T-cells from the donor bone marrow attack epithelial cells in the recipient a phenomenon known as Graft versus Host disease can occur. The effects are classically seen in the GI tract and the skin as opposed to the lungs but pulmonary manifestations can arise a few months after the transplant.

This infection can cause shortness of breath, fever, and patchy lower lobe consolidation. It is important to rule out other possible causes, such as Nocardia, CMV, Graft vs Host Disease, and Bleomycin toxicity, but Invasive aspergillosis is the most likely cause in this case.",2,,C,FALSE,"I chose option 2, Invasive aspergillosis, because the patient's symptoms and clinical context align with this diagnosis.

14586,205045,You are reviewing a cardiac MRI scan which shows a mass in the left ventricle. You are considering a number of differential diagnoses. Which of the following is correctly matched to its description? Select ONE answer only.,SBA: Cardiothoracic and vascular,Cardiac sarcoma - involves left ventricle and left atrium,Atrial thrombus - avid enhancement,Atrial myxoma - mass attached to valve by a stalk,Cardiac metastasis - narrow base attachment to the myocardium,Papillary fibroelastoma - high in signal on T2,A,67%,2%,18%,6%,7%,"Explanation:
Involvement of more than one chamber of the heart is a useful sign of a malignant lesion.
  Cardiac sarcoma
There are many different types of cardiac sarcoma. Cardiac sarcomas are the most common cause of primary malignant cardiac tumours. Their presentation usually relates either to embolic phenomena such as TIAs or symptoms from invasion such as pericardial effusion. In contrast to myxomas or fibroelastomas, malignant lesions tend to have a broad attachment to the heart wall. Involvement of more than one chamber of the heart, regardless of which side is involved, is a strong indicator of malignancy. With regards which side of the heart is affected; the most common kind of cardiac sarcoma is an angiosarcoma and these have a predilection for the right side of the heart however they are also found on the left side, and angiosarcomas account for less than 50% of all sarcomas, the remainder of which are more commonly (though not exclusively) found on the left.
  Cardiac metastases
Metastases are significantly more common than cardiac sarcomas meaning metastases are the most common malignant cardiac tumours. In contrast to myxomas or fibroelastomas, malignant lesions tend to have a broad attachment to the heart wall. Tumours can be from lung or breast cancer, lymphoma, leukaemia and malignant melanoma.
  Papillary fibroelastoma
These tumours are rare even for cardiac tumours but yet are the most common cardiac tumour to be associated with the valves. Rather counter-intuitively, they do not cause valvular dysfunction. They are usually quite small and, like myxomas, relatively mobile, attached by a stalk, and able to prolapse through a valve but where myxomas usually arise from the interatrial septum, papillary fibroelastomas grow from the valve itself. Histopathologically they are gelatinous tumours resembling sea anemones with multiple papillary projections. They can act as a focus for platelet aggregation leading to systemic emboli for left sided masses or pulmonary emboli for right sided masses. On MRI they are often low in signal on T2 weighted sequences owing to their fibrous nature.
  Atrial thrombus
The usual site for an atrial thrombus would be the left atrial appendage. Thrombi are not seen as mobile masses but as irregular lobulated masses. They can have a laminated appearance and the classical feature is low signal on gradient-echo MRI sequences owing to the presence of haemosiderin (blooming artefact). They do not enhance. Ventricular thrombi can form too, it is usually a sequela of a previous myocardial infarction which has healed leaving a hypomobile portion of the ventricular wall. Adjacent to that part of wall there is relative stasis sufficient to facilitate thrombus formation.
  Atrial myxoma
These are the most common benign neoplasms of the heart. Although usually sporadic, they can occur as part of Carney complex (atrial myxoma, facial/buccal pigmentation, sertoli tumours of the testis and multiple other findings. Not to be confused with Carney triad - pulmonary hamartomas, gastric leiomyosarcomas and extra-adrenal paragangliomas). The finding of a small mass attached to the interatrial septum by a stalk is classical. Their mobility allows some to prolapse through the relevant atrioventricular valve during the cardiac cycle. They can act as a focus for platelet aggregation leading to systemic emboli for the more common left sided masses or pulmonary emboli for right sided myxomas. Iso or hypointensity on T1w MRI is typical.

It is usually benign and can cause obstruction of the left atrial outflow tract, leading to a variety of symptoms.",1,1. Basic factual recall,C,FALSE,I chose option 4 (Papillary fibroelastoma - high in signal on T2) because it is the most accurate description among the given options.

9876,205045,A 34-year-old man suffers a knee injury while on a heavily activity based holiday. He undergoes x-rays at a local hospital which show no fractures. On returning home he is referred to an orthopaedic surgeon by his GP when his pain fails to resolve. An MRI is arranged which shows high signal on T2 and STIR sequences affecting the anterior aspect of the tibia. There is also a posterior cruciate ligament tear. What is the most likely diagnosis?,SBA: Musculoskeletal and Trauma,Dashboard injury,Transient patella dislocation,Pivot shift injury,Hyperextension injury,Clip injury,A,70%,1%,4%,23%,2%,"Explanation:
Bony contusions
Bruising to the bone can be detected around 2 days following an injury but may not resolve for many months thereafter. With regards knee injuries, it is often possible to discern the mechanism of injury from the pattern of bruising seen. The contusions follow fluid on MRI scans i.e. low in signal on T1 and high on T2 (and STIR). STIR is used to suppress the fat of the bone marrow thereby making the fluid stand out more.
  Dashboard injury
As the name would suggest, this injury is usually (although not exclusively) sustained by impact of the knee against the dashboard of a car during a road traffic incident. Force applied to the anterior aspect of the tibia when the knee is flexed leads to:
Osteochondral injury or fracture to the anterior aspect of the tibia
Posterior cruciate ligament rupture/sprain
  Clip injury and pivot shift injury
These two injuries are very similar. Both involve valgus stress on a flexed knee (such as a tackle to the knee during sports). A pivot shift injury also requires external rotation of the tibia. The three main structures most at risk during these injuries are:
Anterior cruciate ligament (especially in a pivot shift injury)
Medial collateral ligament (especially in a clip injury)
Medial meniscus (remember that the medial meniscus is attached to the medial collateral ligament)
If all three are present together it is referred to as the O’Donoghue triad. Since O’Donoghue defined this triad however, it has been discovered that lateral meniscal tears are actually more common with this type of injury than medial meniscus ones.
Bony contusions occur at the side of impact because the proximal tibia and distal femur impact on one another thus:
Lateral tibial plateau (posterolateral in pivot shift injury)
Lateral femoral condyle
  Transient lateral patella dislocation injury
When the patella dislocates laterally, its medial facet can impact onto the anterolateral corner of the lateral femoral condyle. Both areas become damaged and contusions can be seen on MRI. Often though, the patella reduces spontaneously and thus the exact mechanism of injury must be inferred from the imaging findings.
Joint effusion
Osteochondral injuries to the anterolateral femoral condyle and medial patella facet
Sprain or disruption to the medial retinaculum
  Hyperextension injury
These occur often following excessively forceful kicking. There will be bony contusions at the anterior aspect of the tibial plateau and femoral condyles. Either of the anterior or posterior cruciate ligaments may also be involved.
Contusions to the anterolateral aspect of the lateral femoral condyle and inferomedial patella",TRUE,"Dashboard injuries are caused by direct trauma to the knee joint, such as a dashboard impact, and are the most likely diagnosis in this case. The MRI findings of high signal on T2 and STIR sequences affecting the anterior aspect of the tibia, as well as the posterior cruciate ligament tear, are consistent with a dashboard injury.",2,,D,TRUE,"I chose ""4. Dashboard injury"" because the MRI findings mentioned in the scenario are consistent with this type of injury. A dashboard injury typically occurs when the knee is forcibly driven into the dashboard during a car accident, causing the tibia to be pushed posteriorly on the femur. This can result in a tear of the posterior cruciate ligament (PCL), as mentioned in the MRI findings. The high signal on T2 and STIR sequences affecting the anterior aspect of the tibia also suggests bone contusion or edema, which is commonly associated with this type of injury. The other options do not align as well with the given MRI findings and the presence of a PCL tear.",A,FALSE,E
14034,205045,A 6-week-old infant undergoes abdominal ultrasound for investigation of prolonged jaundice. Which finding is most indicative of extra-hepatic biliary atresia?

The most specific sign of biliary atresia is the triangular cord sign. This is an echogenic band running anterior to the portal vein at the porta. A small gallbladder, dilated intrahepatic ducts and non-visualisation of the gallbladder are all features consistent with biliary atresia, but the triangular cord sign would be most indicative of the condition. It is associated with polysplenia and heterotaxy syndrome.
  Biliary atresia
This presents between two weeks and two months of life as an obstructive jaundice picture (i.e. conjugated hyperbilirubinaemia). The extrahepatic bile ducts have become fibrosed and cause obstruction. Initial investigation is usually with ultrasound and an echogenic ‘triangular cord’ structure in the porta hepatitis is considered pathognomic. The gallbladder may be normal, small or non-visualised and therefore contributes little to the diagnosis. Further investigation is often with a HIDA scan. If there is normal activity within the liver (usually after only a few minutes) but there is no visualisation of tracer within the bowel after 24 hours this is considered diagnostic. Phenobarbitol can be given in the days leading up to the scan to increase biliary output.",FALSE,"Non-visualisation of the common bile duct is a classic sign of extra-hepatic biliary atresia. In this condition, the bile ducts are blocked, preventing bile from draining from the liver into the intestine. This can lead to jaundice and other complications. The other options are not specific signs of biliary atresia.",2,"This question falls under category 2: A question about clinical judgement, what is the correct diagnosis?",B,FALSE,"I chose option 2, ""Non-visualisation of the common bile duct,"" because extra-hepatic biliary atresia is a condition in which the bile ducts outside the liver are either absent or blocked. This leads to a buildup of bile in the liver, causing liver damage and jaundice. In an abdominal ultrasound, if the common bile duct is not visualized, it suggests that there might be an obstruction or absence of the duct, which is a key characteristic of extra-hepatic biliary atresia.",C,TRUE,A

The supradiaphragmatic portion of the IVC is located above the diaphragm, so when the tumor invades this area, it means that the cancer has spread further from its origin in the kidney.

Select ONE answer only.,SBA: Central Nervous and Head & Neck,Dense triangle sign,Empty delta sign,Bilateral haemorrhages,Subarachnoid haemorrhage,Bilateral infarctions,A,80%,13%,3%,0%,2%,"Explanation:
The empty delta sign is a post-contrast CT finding. Bilateral haemorrhages can be a secondary consequence to a sagittal sinus thrombosis which may point towards the diagnosis but the thrombosis itself is recognised by the empty delta sign on post-contrast CT.
Dense triangle sign pertains to the acute thrombus as it appears on an unenhanced CT scan.
On an MRI, static blood within the sagittal sinus gives rise to low signal on T1, although the thrombus itself is likely to be high in signal (if subacute in nature). Normally the sagittal sinus will appear as a flow void on T1w. Blooming artefact can be seen on T2* gradient echo sequences and is a strong indicatory of the diagnosis. Confusion can arise with time-of-flight 3D reformatted images and great care should be taken not to overdiagnose flow artefactas thrombosis. Careful reference should always be made to the source images and where there is doubt a CT venogram may be of more use.
The associated infarctions can often be haemorrhagic and parasagittal haemorrhages are very specific for a sagittal sinus thrombosis but subarachnoid haemorrhage is not likely to be related.",TRUE,"The dense triangle sign is a CT scan finding that is indicative of sagittal sinus thrombosis. It is seen as a triangular area of increased density in the sagittal sinus on an unenhanced CT scan. This is due to the presence of a clot in the sagittal sinus, which causes a decrease in the flow of blood, leading to an increase in the density of the area.",3,"3. A question about the application of knowledge, what is the best description of this diagnosis?",B,FALSE,"I chose option 1, the ""Empty delta sign,"" because it is the best description of the diagnosis for a sagittal sinus thrombosis on a CT scan. The empty delta sign is a classic radiological sign seen in patients with cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, specifically in the superior sagittal sinus.

Select ONE answer only.",SBA: Musculoskeletal and Trauma,Intersection syndrome,DeQuervains syndrome,Rheumatoid arthritis,Systemic lupus erythematosus,Early Dupuytren contracture,A,68%,28%,1%,0%,2%,"Explanation:
Intersection syndrome
This is tendonitis at the intersection between the 1st and 2nd compartments (1st compartment- extensor pollicis brevis and abductor pollicis longus, 2nd compartment- extensor carpi radialis brevis and longus). It is classically seen in rowers.
  DeQuervains syndrome
This affects the first dorsal compartment (extensor pollicis brevis and abductor pollicis longus) tenosynovitis. It is more common in women.
  Rheumatoid arthritis
Multiple flexor tendonitis can precede joint involvement, however tendonitis at the 1st/ 2nd tendon is specific for intersection syndrome.
  Early Dupuytren contracture
Commonly occurs in people with alcoholic liver disease. Early Dupuytren is a nodular mass on the on the palmar aspect of the aponeurosis.",FALSE,"DeQuervains syndrome is the most likely diagnosis in this case. This condition is characterized by inflammation and irritation of the tendons in the wrist and thumb, which is what the MRI findings suggest. Symptoms include pain and swelling in the thumb side of the wrist, difficulty moving the thumb, and tenderness when pressing on the tendons. Treatment typically involves rest, splinting, and anti-inflammatory medications.",2,,B,TRUE,"I chose option 3, Intersection syndrome, because the clinical presentation and MRI findings match this diagnosis. Intersection syndrome is an overuse injury characterized by pain and swelling at the intersection of the extensor carpi radialis brevis and longus tendons with the abductor pollicis longus and extensor pollicis brevis tendons, typically seen in activities involving repetitive wrist movements, like rowing. The MRI findings of high signal within and increased fluid surrounding the tendons further support this diagnosis. The other options do not fit the described clinical scenario and MRI findings as closely as Intersection syndrome does.",A,FALSE,C
9691,205045,"A 12-year-old boy, who is otherwise well, is taken to his GP by his mother who is concerned that he has developed a limp for the last 2 days. What is the most likely diagnosis?",SBA: Paediatrics,Legg-Calve-Perthes disease,Transient synovitis of the hip,Septic arthritis,Juvenile idiopathic arthritis,Osteoid osteoma,A,32%,59%,4%,4%,1%,"Explanation:
There is very little information to go on in this question, and no actual imaging findings. All of the answers provided could conceivably cause a limp in a 13-year-old boy. Without any additional information however, Perthes disease is the most likely answer. Technically symptoms must have been present for at least 6 weeks for a diagnosis of JIA. The patient is otherwise well and slightly too old for a diagnosis of transient synovitis. Septic arthritis must always be considered and should be investigated for with an ultrasound but there is nothing further in the information provided to suggest this as a diagnosis over Perthes disease. An osteoid osteoma usually presents with night pain.
  Legg-Calve-Perthes disease
Avascular necrosis of the femoral head can occur spontaneously, particularly in young (around 2-12 years, although usually 4-8 years) Caucasian boys. It is named Legg-Calve-Perthes disease and often referred to only as Perthes disease. Avascular necrosis of the femoral head secondary to sickle cell disease, leukaemia or steroid use is not technically Perthes disease.

  Perthes disease is best appreciated on a frog-leg lateral view and this view must always be included in a series when investigating for the disease and the disease should always be considered in patients presenting with a painful limp. Of the early changes, ipsilateral demineralisation is the least consistent with Perthes disease. The presence of a radiolucent crescent shaped subchondral fracture has an even lower incidence but is also not seen until late on in the disease. The goal of imaging is to identify patients early before they reach this stage.
On MRI there will be a ‘double-line’ sign on T2 with sclerotic/necrotic bone returning little signal but the granulation tissue returning high signal. The bone marrow becomes low on T1 and high on T2.
  Transient synovitis of the hip
This is the most common cause of an acute limp in a child and is usually preceded by a viral infection such as an upper respiratory tract infection. Patients may have a low-grade fever and around half have an elevated serum ESR but characteristically the x-rays will be normal with the possible exception of a joint effusion. The usual age-range is 5-10-year-olds.
  Septic arthritis
Septic arthritis in any age group is a surgical emergency and the joint must be washed out as soon as feasible in order to avoid irreversible joint damage caused. Clinical suspicious must therefore be high, not least because early x-rays may be normal. Initial investigation should be with ultrasound and echogenic debris may be found within a joint effusion. The diagnosis is confirmed by aspiration of purulent joint fluid. The condition can also be readily appreciable on MRI which is very sensitive for early joint damage. Synovial oedema can be seen as high signal on T2 with enhancement post-gadolinium on T1 fat saturated sequences.

  Juvenile idiopathic arthritis, (JIA) previously juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (JRA)
This is very similar to rheumatoid arthritis but occurs in patients below the age of 16. Patients present with joint stiffness and pains on waking. Fever and lymph node enlargement are also common. Technically, symptoms must have been present for at least six weeks for the diagnosis to be made. Unlike rheumatoid arthritis it is the large joints which are affected early on with subsequent involvement of the little joints of the hands and feet. On x-ray there will be periarticular osteoporosis but the increased perfusion of the epiphyses as a result of inflammation leads to overgrowth, early fusion and overall bone shortening. Erosions and destruction of the joint can be severe, even resembling a neuropathic joint.
  Osteoid osteoma
These are small benign tumours but which can be quite symptomatic, classically with pain relieved by aspirin. The majority form in the diaphyses of long bones but the posterior elements of the spine is another classic location.
The radiolucent nidus and symptoms of night pain in a young patient point to either an osteoid osteoma or an osteoblastoma. The final diagnosis comes down to size: <1.5 cm is definitely an osteoid osteoma, and >2 cm is definitely an osteoblastoma. There is a nasty grey area somewhere between the two sizes.
On x-ray the radiolucent nidus may not be fully appreciated and the abnormality which is picked up will be the consequential sclerotic solid periosteal reaction. In the spine there may be a painful scoliosis concave towards the lesion as a result of adjacent muscular spasm. CT is used to confirm the diagnosis as the nidus is readily appreciable.",FALSE,I chose this answer because transient synovitis of the hip is the most likely diagnosis for a 12-year-old boy who has developed a limp for the last two days. It is the most common cause of hip pain and limp in children and is usually self-limiting and resolves within a few days with rest and anti-inflammatory medications. It is often preceded by a viral infection and is usually not associated with any joint damage.,2,,B,FALSE,"I chose option 1, Transient synovitis of the hip, because it is the most common cause of hip pain and limping in children, especially in the age group of the patient mentioned in the question. Transient synovitis is a self-limiting inflammation of the synovium (the lining of the joint) and usually occurs after a viral infection. It presents with sudden onset of pain and limping, which aligns with the symptoms described in the question. The other options, while possible, are less likely given the age of the patient and the presentation of the symptoms.",B,TRUE,A
9731,205045,A 9-year-old girl presents with pain and tenderness to the forearm after falling over in the playground at school. She undergoes radiographs of her arm and a fracture to the shaft of the ulna with angulation at the fracture site is readily appreciable.

A Monteggia fracture-dislocation typically occurs following a fall onto an outstretched hand (FOOSH) and consists of an ulnar fracture with a radial head dislocation.
Dislocation at the distal radio-ulnar joint in association with a radial fracture is termed Galeazzi fracture and results from a FOOSH injury where the elbow is flexed at the point of impact.",FALSE,"I chose number 1 because a fracture to the shaft of the ulna is commonly associated with an associated radial shaft fracture and anterior dislocation of the radial head. This type of injury is caused by a direct blow to the ulna, which can cause the radial head to dislocate anteriorly. The bowing fracture of the radius and the dislocation at the distal radio-ulnar joint are less likely to occur in this type of injury.",2,"This question falls under category 2: A question about clinical judgement, what is the correct diagnosis?",B,FALSE,"I chose option 1, which is an associated radial shaft fracture and anterior dislocation of the radial head, because the patient's presentation of pain and tenderness in the forearm after a fall, along with the fracture of the ulna shaft with angulation, is highly suggestive of a Monteggia fracture-dislocation. This injury typically involves a fracture of the proximal third of the ulna and dislocation of the radial head.

14240,205045,A 3-day-old baby boy undergoes an ultrasound for obstructive urinary symptoms. There is bilateral hydronephrosis. You suspect he may have posterior urethral valves. He is investigated with a micturating cystourethrogram (MCUG). Which of the following findings on the MCUG is consistent with this diagnosis? Select ONE answer only.,SBA: Paediatrics,Left sided vesicoureteric reflux,Drooping lily sign,Cobra head sign,Claw sign,Longitudinal filling defect in the posterior urethra,A,49%,3%,12%,1%,35%,"Explanation:
Reflux can be bilateral or unilateral. When unilateral it usually on the left side. The filling defect seen in the posterior urethra is curvilinear and orientated in a transverse manner.
The drooping lily sign is seen with suprarenal tumours such as a neuroblastoma.
The cobra head sign is seen with ureterocoeles.
The claw sign is seen in intrarenal masses such as Wilms tumours.
  Posterior urethral valves
Posterior urethral valves is a condition restricted to baby boys and is sometimes diagnosed antenatally. The posterior urethra consists of the prostatic and membranous portions. The formation of valves here leads to outflow obstruction and dilatation of the posterior urethra. Obstruction causes the trabeculation of the bladder and reflux through the vesico-ureteric junction (which occurs more on the left than the right) causes hydronephrosis. The first line of investigation should be a micturating cystogram which will show fusiform dilatation of the posterior urethra and trabeculation of the bladder as well as any reflux. Prognosis is variable but some patients require renal replacement due to irreversible damage to the kidneys.",FALSE,"The cobra head sign is a specific finding on an MCUG that is indicative of posterior urethral valves. It is characterized by a rounded, cobra-like appearance of the posterior urethra, which is caused by an obstruction at the bladder neck. This is a key diagnostic sign for posterior urethral valves.",2,"This question falls under category 2: A question about clinical judgement, what is the correct diagnosis?",C,FALSE,"I chose the ""Drooping lily sign"" because it is a classic radiological finding on a micturating cystourethrogram (MCUG) that is consistent with the diagnosis of posterior urethral valves (PUV). PUV is a congenital condition in male infants, characterized by obstructing membranes in the posterior urethra, leading to urinary outflow obstruction and hydronephrosis. The ""Drooping lily sign"" refers to the appearance of a dilated and elongated posterior urethra with a sudden tapering or narrowing at the level of the obstructing valves, resembling a drooping lily flower. This sign is considered pathognomonic for PUV and helps in confirming the diagnosis.",B,FALSE,D
14438,205045,Which part of the pancreas is intraperitoneal? Select ONE answer only.,SBA: Gastrointestinal,The tail,The head,The neck,The body,The uncinate process,A,71%,14%,2%,5%,8%,"Explanation:
The pancreas is a glandular organ that has mixed endocrine and exocrine function:
Endocrine function: controls blood glucose levels via the secretion of insulin and glucagon
Exocrine function: secretes digestive enzymes into the duodenum
  The pancreas is approximately 12-15 cm long and lies transversely and obliquely on the posterior abdominal wall behind the stomach. Here it crosses the L1-L2 lumbar vertebrae. The pancreas is a retroperitoneal structure, apart from the tail, which is the only intraperitoneal part.
The exocrine component of the pancreas is composed of a series of clustered cells called acini. The secretory cells of each acinus surround a small intercalated duct, which drain into a network of intralobar collecting ducts. These in turn drain into the pancreatic duct.
The pancreatic duct begins at the tail of the pancreas runs the entire length to the head. Here it unites with the common bile duct to form the ampulla of Vater, which in turn opens into the duodenum. The ampulla of Vater opens into the duodenum and the release of bile at this point is controlled by a muscular valve called the sphincter of Oddi.
The pancreas can be divided into five parts:
1. The head:
This is the widest part and lies within the ‘C-shaped’ curve created by the duodenum. It rests posteriorly on the inferior vena cava, the right renal artery and vein and the left renal vein. The bile duct lies in a groove on its posterior surface.
  2. The uncinate process:
This is a prolongation of the head that extends superiorly and to the left to lie beneath the body. It lies posterior to the superior mesenteric vessels.
  3. The neck:
This is located between the head and the body. It lies in the transpyloric plane approximately 1-2 cm to the right of the midline. It is grooved posteriorly by the superior mesenteric vessels and the hepatic portal vein is formed by the union of the superior mesenteric vein and the splenic vein posterior to it.
  4. The body: this is the central part of the pancreas. It extends from the neck along a line running upwards and to the left for about 10 cm until it reaches the hilum of the spleen. It crosses anterior to the aorta, the L2 vertebra, the left adrenal gland, and the left kidney during its course.
  5. The tail: this is the end of the pancreas. It lies in close proximity to the hilum of the spleen and passes between the layers of the splenorenal ligament. This is the only part of the pancreas that is intraperitoneal.
  The pancreas and its relations (from Gray’s Anatomy)
 ",FALSE,"The body of the pancreas is intraperitoneal, meaning it is located within the peritoneal cavity.

The quadriceps femoris complex consists of four muscles located on the front of the thigh: the rectus femoris, the vastus lateralis, the vastus intermedius, and the vastus medialis.

1. Basic factual recall, either of basic science, physics, anatomy or regarding a procedure.",A,TRUE,"I chose option 5, the quadriceps femoris complex, because it is the primary muscle group that attaches to the patella. The quadriceps femoris complex is a group of four muscles located in the anterior (front) compartment of the thigh, and they function to extend the knee. These muscles include the rectus femoris, vastus lateralis, vastus medialis, and vastus intermedius. They converge to form a single tendon, the quadriceps tendon, which inserts onto the patella.

10891,205045,A 64-year-old man with known rheumatoid arthritis develops respiratory symptoms. He undergoes an HRCT. In which region would you most expect there to be radiological changes?,SBA: Cardiothoracic and vascular,Lower zones,Upper zones,No zonal predilection,Centrally,Peripherally,A,74%,15%,3%,1%,7%,"Explanation:
Involvement of either the upper or lower zones is typical for a number of different pathologies. Many of the upper lobe pathologies related to inhalational processes and conversely many of the lower lobe pathologies can be explained by their basis in the increased blood flow. There are a number of different mnemonics for either area, some better than others.
For example, a mnemonic for involvement of the upper zones is BREASTS:
B = Beryllosis
R = Radiation
E = Eosinophilic granuloma (Langerhans cell histiocytosis) and Extrinsic Allergic Alveolitis
A = Ankylosing spondylitis
S = Sarcoidosis
T = Tuberculosis
S = Silicosis
  Involvement of the lower zones can be remembered with the mnemonic BADAS:
B = Bronchiectasis
A = Aspiration pneumonia
D = Drugs and Desquamative interstitial pneumonia
A = Asbestosis
S = Scleroderma (and Rheumatoid arthritis)",TRUE,"Lower zones are most commonly affected in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and respiratory symptoms. This is because the lower zones of the lungs are most affected by chronic inflammation, which is a common symptom of rheumatoid arthritis. HRCT scans can reveal changes in the lower zones of the lungs, such as air trapping, mucus plugging, and consolidation, which can be indicative of inflammation.",1,"This question falls under category 1: Basic factual recall, either of basic science, physics, anatomy or regarding a procedure.",A,TRUE,"I chose the lower zones (option 5) because patients with rheumatoid arthritis often develop pulmonary manifestations, and these are more commonly seen in the lower zones of the lungs. Rheumatoid arthritis can cause a variety of lung conditions, such as pleural effusion, interstitial lung disease, and bronchiectasis, which tend to affect the lower lung zones more frequently. This is due to the increased gravitational forces in these areas, leading to more significant inflammation and fibrosis. Additionally, the lower zones have a higher blood flow, which may contribute to the increased susceptibility to disease in these regions.",A,FALSE,E
14299,205212,A 67-year-old man is admitted following a stroke. He undergoes an MRI scan which shows high DWI signal and high ADC in the fronto-parietal lobe as well as high DWI and low ADC signal in the medial posterior temporal lobe. Which of the following combinations best explains these findings? Select ONE answer only.,SBA: Central Nervous and Head & Neck,Acute PCA infarct and old MCA infarct,Acute PCA infarct and old ACA infarct,Acute MCA and old PCA infarct,Acute ACA infarct and old MCA infarct,Acute MCA infarct and old ACA infarct,A,65%,6%,6%,7%,16%,"Explanation:
Acute infarctions are seen as bright areas on DWI with a corresponding low signal area on the ADC map, however in the 7-15 days following a stroke there is first pseudonormalisation and then reversal of the ADC signal. This occurs as cerebral necrosis and the increased water content of the affected tissue gives rise to T2 shine through effect. The medial posterior temporal lobe is a slightly clumsily worded anatomical location. Largely speaking if the brain tissue is adjacent to the falx it is NOT supplied by the MCA.",FALSE,"The MRI findings in the fronto-parietal lobe indicate an acute PCA infarct, as high DWI signal and high ADC in this area are indicative of an acute ischemic infarct. The findings in the medial posterior temporal lobe indicate an old ACA infarct, as high DWI and low ADC signal in this area are indicative of an old ischemic infarct. Therefore, the combination of findings best explains these findings is an acute MCA infarct and an old ACA infarct.",2,"3. A question about application of knowledge, what is the best treatment option?

This question falls under 2. A question about clinical judgement, what is the correct diagnosis?",E,TRUE,"I chose option 3 (Acute PCA infarct and old MCA infarct) because the MRI findings described in the question are consistent with this combination of infarcts.

High DWI (diffusion-weighted imaging) signal and low ADC (apparent diffusion coefficient) signal are indicative of an acute infarct, as they represent restricted diffusion due to cytotoxic edema in the acute phase of a stroke. In this case, the medial posterior temporal lobe is affected, which is supplied by the posterior cerebral artery (PCA).

On the other hand, high DWI signal and high ADC signal suggest an old infarct, as the increased ADC represents facilitated diffusion due to the chronic phase of a stroke when the tissue has already been damaged and gliosis has occurred. The fronto-parietal lobe is affected in this case, which is supplied by the middle cerebral artery (MCA).

Therefore, the combination of an acute PCA infarct and an old MCA infarct best explains the MRI findings in this patient.",A,TRUE,A
14099,205212,You make an assessment of an elderly patient with worsening abdominal pain. He has a known diagnosis of a malignant tumour of the greater omentum. Which SINGLE statement regarding the greater omentum is true?,SBA: Gastrointestinal,It attaches to the anterosuperior aspect of the transverse colon,The gastrophrenic ligament attaches to the underside of the right dome of the diaphragm,It is highly immobile,It has a poor vascular supply,It attaches to the underside of the liver,A,64%,16%,8%,4%,9%,"Explanation:
The greater omentum is a large, fat-laden fold of visceral peritoneum that hangs like an apron from the greater curvature of the stomach and the inferior border of the proximal half of the first part of the duodenum. It consists of a double sheet of peritoneum, folded back in on itself so that it has four layers. It descends downwards to attach to the anterosuperior aspect of the transverse colon.
The greater omentum can be subdivided according to the organ to which it attaches:
Gastrophrenic ligament – extends to the underside of the left dome of the diaphragm
Gastrocolic ligament – extends to the transverse colon (main attachment)
Gastrosplenic ligament – extends to the spleen
  The greater omentum prevents the visceral peritoneum from adhering to the parietal peritoneum lining the abdominal wall. It has considerable mobility enabling it to migrate throughout the peritoneal cavity. It is sometimes referred to as the ‘policeman of the abdomen‘ because of its rich vascular supply. In cases of intra-abdominal infection or inflammation it can migrate to the affected area and wrap itself around the inflamed organ to ‘wall it off’ and protect other viscera. Because of its rich vascular supply it can also provide leukocytes to fight the infection.
  The greater omentum (from Sobotta’s Human Anatomy)",TRUE,"I chose this answer because the greater omentum is a fold of peritoneum that attaches to the anterosuperior aspect of the transverse colon. This attachment is important for providing support and stability to the transverse colon, as well as for providing a barrier to the spread of infection. The other options are incorrect because the gastrophrenic ligament attaches to the diaphragm, the greater omentum is highly mobile, and it has a good vascular supply.",1,"This question falls under category 1: Basic factual recall, either of basic science, physics, anatomy or regarding a procedure.",A,TRUE,"I chose option 2 because it is the correct statement regarding the greater omentum. The greater omentum is a large, fatty, apron-like fold of visceral peritoneum that hangs down from the stomach.

11116,205212,A 31-year-old woman is involved in a road traffic collision but no injuries are found on her trauma CT. A few months later she presents to her GP complaining of right sided weakness and other non-specific arm symptoms. She is referred up to her local hospital for an orthopaedic opinion and undergoes an MRI scan of her cervical and thoracic spine. At C6/C7 there are fluid filled spaces at the exit foramina and the nerve roots are not visualised. What is the most likely explanation?,SBA: Musculoskeletal and Trauma,Nerve root avulsion,Tarlov cyst,Neuropraxia,Acute inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy,Syringomyelia,A,74%,10%,5%,3%,8%,"Explanation:
A traumatic nerve root avulsion has been described but the remainder of the question is based in simple anatomy.
In the cervical spine the nerve roots exit above their named vertebral body; thus at the level of C4/5 it is the C5 which will be exiting. This is unlike the lumbar spine where the nerve root exits below its named vertebral body and is explained by the presence of 8 cervical nerve roots with only 7 cervical vertebra.
  A Tarlov cyst
A tarlov cyst is the name given to dilatation of the posterior nerve root sheath. They follow CSF on all sequences.
  Neuropraxia refers to a temporary nerve injury.
  Acute inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (AIDP) is a term used to describe a subtype of Guillain-Barre syndrome which is an autoimmune mediated ascending flaccid paralysis. Most imaging will be normal in such cases, with the exception of some possible contrast enhancement and thickening to the nerve roots at the cauda equina.
  Syringomyelia
A syrinx is a cavity within the spinal cord. They can be post-traumatic in nature but are more often thought of as a congenital entity. There is an association with Chiari I malformations (as well as myelomeningocoele, Chiari II, Dandy-Walker and Klippel-Feil) and a finding of either a syrinx or Chiari I should trigger a search for the other.  On MRI they are seen as a CSF signal cavity running longitudinally within the spinal cord. They are associated with symptoms such as spasticity and hyperreflexia (upper motor neurone signs) to the region affected, alongside a reduction in pain and temperature sensation due to the effect on the spinothalamic tracts.  A Charcot joint, particularly of the shoulder, can result from a syrinx within the cervical cord.",TRUE,"Nerve root avulsion is the most likely explanation as it is a common injury that occurs in a road traffic collision. Nerve root avulsion occurs when the nerve root is forcibly pulled from its attachment to the spinal cord and can cause pain, weakness, and other symptoms.",2,"3.

What is the most likely diagnosis?","SBA: Genito urinary, Adrenal, Obstetrics & Gynaecology and Breast",Endometriosis,Pelvic inflammatory disease,Krukenberg tumours,Meig syndrome,Asherman syndrome,A,94%,1%,2%,2%,1%,"Explanation:
Endometriosis
The presence of endometrial tissue outside the uterine cavity is known as endometriosis. It can be a debilitating condition, causing significant pelvic pain and is a leading cause of subfertility. Ultrasound is useful for visualising endometriomas but MRI is far better for reviewing abdominal disease and evaluating adhesions. Findings on MRI in endometriosis can be complex and variable.
  Endometrioma 
These occur as part of the spectrum of endometriosis. Although often ovarian in location they can be found in the peritoneal cavity as well as elsewhere. The ectopic endometrial tissue undergoes cyclical haemorrhage leading to a build-up of blood products and debris which gives rise to a variety of imaging characteristics. Most commonly they appear as a single cyst with posterior acoustic enhancement and homogeneous internal low-level echoes on ultrasound. On MRI the signal characteristics will vary depending on the blood content. High T1 signal suggests old blood products but must be differentiated from the fat of a potential teratoma by checking to see that the signal persists (or is not suppressed) on the fat saturated sequences. The presence of the Shading sign is very suggestive of an endometrioma and occurs when there is low signal on T2 as blood products are usually low on T2. The shading sign is useful to make the distinction from haemorrhagic corpus luteal cysts since the fresh blood in those will not have degraded sufficient to cause the T2 darkening of endometriomas.
  Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID)
This is a coverall term applied to ascending infection of the genital tract. It encompasses endometriosis, salpingitis, hydrosalpinx, pyosalpinx, and tubo-ovarian abscesses. Chlamydia and gonorrhoea account of most of the cases and the disease is most prevalent in sexually active young people. Imaging features are those secondary to inflammation with increased vascularity to the endometrium and small volume ascites. Inflammation is also seen on MRI as avid enhancement post contrast. Pelvic inflammatory disease can be complicated by a condition called Fitz-Hugh-Curtis syndrome where there is perihepatitis secondary to PID. 
  Krukenberg tumours 
A Kruckenberg tumour is a metastatic deposit from stomach cancer which causes ovarian masses. These are often bilateral and can be mistaken for primary malignancies. The histology is of a mucin producing 'signet-ring' cell cancer of which most derive from the stomach but colorectal, breast, lung, and pancreatic versions can also cause Kruckenberg tumours. On all modalities the tumours have a complex part-cystic, part-solid appearance. 
  Meig syndrome
This is a triad of an ovarian fibroma (usually, other ovarian tumours do cause it too), ascites and pleural effusions. A right sided pleural effusion is more common than the left. The underlying mechanism is unclear. Two possible explanations are that either the tumour irritates the peritoneum leading to a build up of inflammatory fluid, or that histamine release alongside other chemicals and hormones causes vasodilation and fluid exudation that way. 
  Asherman syndrome
Historically this condition was the result of infection with tuberculosis but nowadays it is more often the consequence of iatrogenic endometrial damage. The formation of intrauterine synechiae leads to subfertility and these fibrous bands can be seen on HSG as filling defects and surface irregularity. ",FALSE,"Meig syndrome is an ovarian pathology characterized by the presence of a unilateral ovarian cyst with high signal intensity on T1-weighted sequences and low signal intensity on T2-weighted sequences, as well as internal septations and/or calcifications. The cyst is typically 5 cm or greater in diameter. The patient's symptoms of pelvic pain, combined with the ultrasound and MRI findings, indicate that Meig Syndrome is the most likely diagnosis.",2,,A,TRUE,"I chose endometriosis as the most likely diagnosis based on the imaging findings and the patient's symptoms. The presence of a 5 cm round, cystic mass on the left ovary, along with the MRI findings of high signal on T1 weighted sequences, low signal on T2 weighted sequences, and shading within the mass are consistent with an endometrioma. Endometriomas are ovarian cysts filled with old blood and are a common manifestation of endometriosis. Pelvic pain is a common symptom associated with endometriosis, making this diagnosis the most likely given the provided information.",A,TRUE,A
9256,205212,In a teaching session you are presented with an MRI scan which shows low T2 signal in the liver and spleen. The consultant taking the session refuses to provide you with any details of the patient’s history or presenting complaint. Which of the following would best fit with these findings?,SBA: Gastrointestinal,Haemochromatosis,Amiodarone therapy,Gauchers,Sickle Cell Disease,Wilson disease,A,75%,6%,5%,9%,6%,"Explanation:
The MRI appearance of primary and secondary haemochromatosis are not the same. The spleen is only involved in secondary haemochromatosis.
  Haemochromatosis
The primary version of this disease can be inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion. Excess dietary iron is absorbed and this accumulates in all tissues of the body leading to various different problems.
Secondary haemochromatosis can arise if patients receive numerous blood transfusions without sufficient chelation to mitigate against the iron overload.
Cirrhosis – the presence of the excess iron in the liver leads to unusual signal properties on an MRI scan. Iron is paramagnetic and causes spin dephasing. T2* and T2 sequences are particularly vulnerable to this effect but lower than expected signal will be seen on all sequences. Importantly the signal from the spleen and bone marrow should be normal. By contrast they will be involved in cases of transfusional siderosis.
Generalised osteoporosis
Hook like osteophytes on the radial aspect of the metacarpal heads – these are highly characteristic
Chondrocalcinosis, particularly affecting the knees
Insulin dependent diabetes
Congestive cardiomyopathy
Skin pigmentation
  Wilson disease
Inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion, this disease results from an excess of copper within the body due to the inability of the liver to excrete it. It can present in childhood with cirrhosis but later presentations are more likely to be due to the neuropsychiatric manifestations. Clinically adolescent or adult patients develop tremor and dysarthria due to copper deposition in the lentiform nucleus. The classic diagnostic feature is Kayser-Fleischer pigment rings in the eyes. Radiologically the following features can be seen:
Hepatic manifestations: The liver appears normal on MRI since fatty infiltration effectively cancels out the paramagnetic effects of copper
Musculoskeletal manifestations: Generalised osteoporosis, subarticular cysts, chondrocalcinosis and arthropathy which can mimic CPPD
CNS manifestations: White matter atrophy and T2 hyperintensities predominantly affecting the basal ganglia and thalami. T1 signal is also high in these areas, differentiating it from many of the other basal ganglia disorders. There is a classical feature of ‘sparing of the red nucleus’ leading to an appearance known as the giant panda sign at the level of the pons.
  Gaucher disease
This lysosomal storage disease is usually inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion and is around 100 times more common in Ashkenazi Jews than it is in the rest of the population. There is accumulation of glycolipid in macrophage lysosomes. The infantile form is universally lethal before 24 months of age but the adult form may be asymptomatic at diagnosis and is typically diagnosed in young adulthood if not earlier. Hepatosplenomegaly is common and co-existent with thrombocytopaenia and anaemia secondary to bone marrow failure. Osteonecrosis occurs in the femoral or humeral heads leaving serpiginous sclerotic areas or a bone-within-bone appearance. Modelling deformities such as the Erlenmeyer flask deformity (Flared metaphysis + diaphyseal thinning) also occur and are considered characteristic.
  Sickle cell disease
The signal from the spleen may be affected by haemosiderin deposition due to haemolysis within the spleen but the liver is unlikely to be affected.
  Amiodarone therapy
Amiodarone is an anti-arrhythmic drug which contains iodine (am-IOD-arone). Consequently, as it accumulates in the liver, it can cause significant increase in density to the liver on a CT scan.",TRUE,"Haemochromatosis is a condition in which too much iron is stored in the body, leading to damage to the liver and spleen. The MRI scan findings of low T2 signal in the liver and spleen are consistent with this diagnosis, as iron can cause a decrease in the T2 signal intensity of organs on MRI.",3,"3.

Haemochromatosis is a disorder characterized by excessive iron accumulation in various organs, including the liver and spleen.

9756,205212,A 65-year-old lady complains to her GP of ongoing burning pains in her hand and wrist following a fall 6 months previously. At the time she was found to have fractured her ulnar styloid process and wore a plaster cast for 6 weeks. She is otherwise well. On examination her hand is oedematous with some dystrophic nail changes. She undergoes an x-ray and nuclear medicine scan. The GP suspects a diagnosis of complex regional pain syndrome. Which of the following combination of findings would be most likely?,SBA: Musculoskeletal and Trauma,Increased perfusion with osteoporosis,Increased perfusion without osteoporosis,Decreased perfusion with osteoporosis,Decreased perfusion without osteoporosis,Increased delayed perfusion without osteoporosis,A,65%,11%,13%,3%,7%,"Explanation:
Complex regional pain syndrome also known as Sudeck dystrophy
Patients develop chronic pain in an area previously affected by an, often disproportionately mild, injury. The pain is said to be burning in nature and symptoms of allodynia (pain with stimuli which would not normally be painful) and hyperalgesia (excessive sensitivity to pain) are also usually described. By contrast, reduced sensation is not normally found. On x-ray there is juxta-articular osteopenia with sub-periosteal bone resorption but preservation of the joint spaces. Soft tissue swelling can also be seen. Nuclear medicine tests may show either increased flow with increased uptake on the delayed blood pool images or (less commonly) decreased flow with decreased uptake on the delayed blood pool images.",FALSE,"The most likely combination of findings for complex regional pain syndrome is decreased perfusion without osteoporosis. This is because complex regional pain syndrome is a condition in which the nerves in the affected area become hypersensitive and can cause pain, swelling, and changes in skin color. Decreased perfusion is a common finding in complex regional pain syndrome, as the nerves become less responsive to signals from the brain, leading to decreased blood flow to the affected area. Osteoporosis is not typically associated with complex regional pain syndrome, as it is a condition that affects the bones and not the nerves.",2,,D,TRUE,"I chose option 4 (Increased perfusion with osteoporosis) because it best fits the clinical presentation and suspected diagnosis of complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS). CRPS is a chronic pain condition that often affects extremities like the hand and wrist after an injury, such as the fracture the patient experienced. 

In CRPS, there is an abnormal response to the injury, leading to persistent pain, swelling, and changes in skin color and temperature. Increased perfusion is a common finding in the affected area, as it reflects the increased blood flow and inflammatory response associated with CRPS. This increased perfusion can be detected on a nuclear medicine scan.

Osteoporosis is also a common finding in CRPS, as the ongoing inflammation and disuse of the affected limb can lead to a decrease in bone density. This can be seen on an X-ray as a sign of the disease progression.

Therefore, option 4 (Increased perfusion with osteoporosis) is the most likely combination of findings in this patient with suspected complex regional pain syndrome.",A,TRUE,A
10161,205212,A 42-year-old man is brought in after suffering a motorbike accident. He undergoes a trauma series CT scan. The radiologist on-call suspects a diaphragmatic rupture.

The dependant viscera sign refers to the fact that during the trauma CT scan the patient is usually lying supine and therefore herniated abdominal viscera within the thoracic cavity lies dependant in a posterior position within the thorax.
The hourglass sign (also known as the collar sign), which is so often talked about in the literature, refers to the appearance of the abdominal viscera either side of a diaphragmatic defect with waisting seen at the site of the defect.

This question falls under category 3: A question about the application of knowledge to a clinical situation.",C,FALSE,"I chose option 3, lower rib fractures, as the least likely to be seen with a diaphragmatic rupture because the other options are more specific to diaphragmatic injuries or their direct consequences.

1. Hourglass sign: This sign is seen when there is a herniation of abdominal contents through the diaphragmatic defect, creating an hourglass shape.
2. Dependent viscera sign: This occurs when abdominal organs, such as the stomach or intestines, are seen in the thoracic cavity due to the diaphragmatic rupture.
4. Discontinuity of the diaphragm: This is a direct sign of diaphragmatic rupture, as it indicates a tear or defect in the diaphragm.
5. Associated abdominal injuries: These are common with diaphragmatic ruptures, as the same blunt or penetrating trauma that causes the rupture can also injure other abdominal structures.

Lower rib fractures, while they can be associated with blunt trauma, are not specific to diaphragmatic injury and can be seen in various other thoracic and abdominal traumas. Therefore, they are the least likely to be seen with a diaphragmatic rupture compared to the other options.",C,TRUE,A

A thorough clerking and examination by a conscientious colleague of yours in A+E narrows the cause down to a possible testicular issue and you are asked to perform an ultrasound. Following appropriate consent procedures you find that the left testicle is small and homogeneously hypoechoic when compared to the right. The epididymis is enlarged and echogenic. What is the most likely diagnosis?",SBA: Paediatrics,Chronic testicular torsion,Acute testicular torsion,Missed testicular torsion,Reversed torsion,Epididymo-orchitis,A,55%,4%,34%,2%,5%,"Explanation:
Testicular torsion
Testicular torsion is a surgical emergency with salvage rates dropping sharply beyond the first six hours. A normal ultrasound scan does not exclude testicular torsion, particularly if performed within the first six hours. Acute unilateral pain beginning at night is a typical history and the peak age range is in either newborn boys or young adolescents (13-16 years). Ultrasound features, if present, are as follows:
Hypoechoic compared to the normal side (after 6 hours)
Heterogenous if there is ischaemic necrosis present (after 24 hours)
Enlarged (after 8 hours)
Absent Doppler signal (incomplete torsion can show flow)
Twisting of the spermatic cord with spiralling vessels
  Missed torsion
Where ultrasound features of heterogeneous testis with increased peri-testicular flow but absent testicular flow are found in a patient with symptoms lasting longer than 24 hours, a missed torsion can be diagnosed.
  Chronic torsion
Beyond around 10 days the testicle becomes small and homogeneously hypoechoic with an enlarged and echogenic epididymis.
  Reversed torsion also known as torsion-detorsion sequence
Increased blood flow within the testicle is either caused by infection or reversed torsion (a testicular tumour can also show increased blood flow).
  Epididymo-orchitis
Infection of the epididymis with concomitant infection of the testis is called epididymo-orchitis; it is seen most commonly in young adolescents with Chlamydia and Gonorrhoea accounting for most cases in this age range. In older patients E-coli and proteus are more likely to be responsible. Ultrasound is useful only in excluding testicular torsion as a cause of the pain (although a normal scrotal ultrasound does not exclude torsion), and investigating the possibility of abscess formation in cases refractory to antibiotic therapy. On ultrasound a reactive hydrocoele is often present and epididymal enlargement occurs. Colour Doppler flow can be used to demonstrate hyperaemia within the testicle and epididymis as would be expected for an infective process. Historically nuclear medicine scanning was used to confirm the diagnosis with findings of increased activity in the epididymis being expected owing to the hyperaemia.",FALSE,"I chose 5 because the ultrasound findings suggest that the left testicle is small and homogeneously hypoechoic, while the epididymis is enlarged and echogenic. These findings are consistent with epididymo-orchitis, which is an inflammation of the testicle and epididymis. Testicular torsion would present with a twisted spermatic cord and a testicle that is enlarged and heterogeneously echogenic.",2,,A,FALSE,"I chose option 2, ""Missed testicular torsion,"" because the ultrasound findings described in the scenario are consistent with this condition. The small and homogeneously hypoechoic left testicle suggests a lack of blood flow and possible necrosis, which can result from a missed or untreated testicular torsion. Additionally, the enlarged and echogenic epididymis may indicate inflammation secondary to the torsion. In acute testicular torsion, the ultrasound findings would typically show more acute changes, such as decreased echogenicity and enlargement of the affected testicle. The other options (reversed torsion, chronic testicular torsion, and epididymo-orchitis) do not match the ultrasound findings as closely as missed testicular torsion does.",C,TRUE,A
10081,205212,A 64-year-old lady who underwent a wide local excision for the management of her breast cancer presents with back pain and is found to have metastatic disease in her thoracic vertebra.

Normal bone marrow
High (fatty) Intermediate
Post-Radiotherapy
Very high and homogenous Intermediate (initially high due to oedema)
Haemangioma
High High
Abnormal bone (metastases, myeloma, regeneration)
Low but enhances with Gadolinium High (fluid)
Blastic metastases (prostate, breast, TCC) and myelofibrosis
Low Low
  Metastases
Normally metastatic deposits in the spine lead to low T1 signal and high T2 signal. There should be no signal drop out on fat saturated sequences in contrast to marrow reconversion where although red marrow will experience far less signal dropout than yellow marrow, there will still be some loss in signal owing to the fat content of both types of marrow.
Sclerotic or blastic metastases return little signal on either T1 or T2 weighted sequences. These include prostate, breast or TCC metastases among others.
Breast cancer can cause lytic or sclerotic metastases or a mixed picture.
Lytic metastases are more likely than sclerotic metastases to enhance with contrast. Similarly on DWI imaging, whereas lytic metastases will usually appear hyperintense, sclerotic metastases return little signal since they contain little water.
If there is a diffuse abnormality of the bone marrow it can be difficult to identify but normal bone marrow should not be lower in signal intensity than the muscle on T1 weighted sequences.",FALSE,"Metastatic lesions in the thoracic vertebrae typically appear as high signal intensity on T1-weighted images and low signal intensity on T2-weighted images.

Please note that the question asks for the answer that is NOT correct.
The anatomy of the middle ear is complex but important and contains a number of specific anatomical terms.
  Image © Medical Exam Prep
  The epitympanum, also known as the attic, is the superior portion above the highest point of the tympanic membrane. It contains the head of the malleus and the short crus of the incus (These give the appearance of an ice-cream cone on an axial CT).
  Image © Medical Exam Prep
  The Prussak space is found within the epitympanum and is a tiny space at the top of the tympanic membrane, just behind the scutum. Its clinical relevance is that it is the usual origin for pars flaccida cholesteatomas.
The aditus ad antrum connects the epitympanum to the mastoid antrum and thence the mastoid air cells.
The tegmen mastoidium (tegmen means roof) is the point at which the mastoid air cells meet the temporal lobe of the brain.
The tegmen tympani is the point at which the upper most extent of the epitympanum reaches the temporal lobe of the brain.
    Image © Medical Exam Prep
  The mesotympanum is the space posterior to the tympanic membrane and contains the body of the incus, the manubrium (connected to the tympanic membrane) and the anterior process of the malleus and the stapes. The stapes is connected to the incus as well as the oval window of the cochlea. There is also a round window placed more inferiorly which bulges to allow compression waves transmitted from the stapes to the oval window to travel through the cochlea.

Acute idiopathic scrotal wall oedema syndrome
This occurs mostly in children under the age of 10 but can occur in adults too and is an important differential diagnosis for acute scrotal pain. It is thought to be a kind of localised hypersensitivity reaction. Scrotal swelling is typical but accompanying pain may or may not be present. Features are usually fairly typical on ultrasound with unilateral scrotal wall oedema (can be bilateral in 10%) and hypervascularity.

14144,205212,A 31-year-old lady who is 15 weeks pregnant with her first pregnancy presents with shortness of breath and tachycardia. Full blood count and renal function tests are normal. The admitting team suspect she may have a pulmonary embolism. Which of the following is correct? Select ONE answer only.,"SBA: Genito urinary, Adrenal, Obstetrics & Gynaecology and Breast",A perfusion-only scan may be able to exclude a pulmonary embolism,A chest radiograph is not necessary because further imaging is planned,A doppler scan of the legs is not indicated even if there are symptoms of a DVT,A CTPA study will confer a greater radiation dose to the foetus of this patient than a V/Q scan,Iodinated contrast is safe to use because it does not cross the placenta,A,79%,2%,1%,11%,6%,"Explanation:
A pregnant patient suspected to have a pulmonary embolus should undergo a chest x-ray to look for alternative causes of shortness of breath such as a lower respiratory tract infection, pleural effusions or a pneumothorax. In the event that they go on to have a VQ scan a chest radiograph is required for comparison.
Thereafter the patient should undergo bilateral lower limb venous dopplers if they have signs or symptoms of deep vein thrombosis. Around a third of pregnant patients who develop pulmonary emboli will have a deep vein thrombosis and for these patients treatment can be started on the basis of their DVT diagnosis without the need for further imaging. If the patient has no signs or symptoms of a DVT, they should proceed to a VQ scan or a CTPA.
The patient should be counselled that there is a small increase in the absolute risk of the foetus developing a childhood cancer following a maternal VQ scan but also that the absolute risk of maternal breast cancer is reduced compared to a CTPA.
  CTPA
CTPA imaging confers a lower dose to the foetus than V/Q scanning, although this effect is diminished in the third trimester as the gravid uterus becomes closer to the field of view.
Unfortunately however, CTPA confers a far greater dose to the breast tissue of the mothers at a time when the tissue is more radiosensitive than it would otherwise be in a non-pregnant woman.
A secondary consideration is the use of iodinated contrast. Iodine crosses the placenta and is excreted by the foetal kidneys into the amniotic fluid. Babies of mothers who have received iodinated contrast during pregnancy should be tested during their first week of life for thyroid suppression although there is little evidence in literature to suggest that many if any infants have developed hypothyroidism following maternal intravenous iodine exposure.
Technical factors to performing a CTPA scan in pregnant patients, if required, are also important to consider. Hyperdynamic circulation can render usual triggering bolus mechanisms suboptimal and raise the possibility of a non-diagnostic study.
  V/Q or Q only scanning
V/Q scanning confers a far lower breast dose to the mother but the dose to the foetus, particularly when small, can be greater owing to tracer accumulation within the solid organs of the mother. The mother should be encouraged to adequately hydrate and void frequently in the subsequent hours/days following a scan.
Many institutes choose to perform perfusion scanning only in pregnant women on the understanding that if the perfusion scan is normal then there is no need to go on to perform the ventilation study. The perfusion scan can also be performed at half the usual dose to further reduce the foetal-dose. Naturally doing so comes with the trade-off of lower sensitivity and specificity.
  Gadolinium in pregnancy
Gadolinium also crosses the placenta and is excreted by the foetus into the amniotic fluid. The chelated form of gadolinium in itself poses no risk to the foetus however the free form of gadolinium is teratogenic and the longer the foetus is exposed to the chelated gadolinium administered for the scan, the greater the risk of each molecule of gadolinium becoming dissociated from its chelate. For this reason therefore, gadolinium should only be administered in a patient known to be pregnant, if there is likely to be significant diagnostic benefit from the resultant images.
  Considerations during lactation
Less than 1% of injected iodine or gadolinium is excreted into breast milk and less than 1% of this is then absorbed by the baby's intestinal tract. Although these amounts are considered acceptably low as to not necessitate any breast-feeding cessation advice many families are understandably over-cautious. It is accepted that contrast agents are undetectable in blood 24hours after administration and so any mother wishing to 'pump-and-dump' despite the negligible risks need not do so for longer than a day. Care should, however, be given to counsel the family that it is possible for inadvertent weaning to occur even after short intervals and this should be factored in to any decision made by the family.
Following a nuclear medicine study the risks to the baby are two-fold; firstly from tracer excretion into the breast milk, but also through proximity to the mother during breast-feeding. Recommendations for breast-feeding interruption vary depending on the half-life of the tracer used. For perfusion imaging using technetium (half-life 6 hours) breast milk should be expressed for the first 24 hours following the scan. In theory, it need not be discarded but can safely be bottle-fed to the baby after these 24 hours have elapsed, however in practice many patients none-the-less choose to discard it.
Most tracers simply require adherence to a washout time but of note, the precautions following administration of Gallium-67 based tracers (most commonly used for pyrexia of unknown origin) are much more limiting and, practically speaking, unfortunately lead to complete cessation of breastfeeding. The half-life of Ga-67 is approximately 78 hours. Breastfeeding should, if time allows, be stopped for 2-4 weeks prior to the scan to allow the breast tissue to become less radiosensitive while the tracer circulates within the mother. Where this is an unacceptably long delay for the clinical state of the patient the study can be performed straight away anyway but in either case, milk should also be discarded for at least a further two weeks following the study. Clearly a disruption to breast-feeding of such a long time is far from ideal, even assuming that a patient who is sufficiently unwell as to need a PUO study is able to continue breast-feeding at all, and is likely to lead to complete cessation of breast-feeding.

Pseudo-cyst of calcaneus
This is a variation of the normal trabecular pattern centrally within the calcaneus. Will not have a crisp edge for this reason. Persistence of thin trabeculae and a visible nutrient foramen are supporting features.
  Unicameral bone cyst
This is a well-defined lesion with thick sclerotic edges and potentially a multiloculated appearance. Absence of calcification within the lesion is a key differentiator from intraosseous lipoma, although if fractured, a fallen fragment sign can be seen.
  Intraosseus lipoma
Calcification within the center of this lesion is a key feature which differentiates it from other lesions of plain film. Fat density on CT or MRI would also be a key differentiator.
  Geode
This is a subchondral cyst associated with osteoarthritis which should have communication with the joint space and be present in an older patient.
  Chondroblastoma
The calcaneus, like the patella, is an epiphyseal equivalent, so any epiphyseal lesions should be considered a possibility in this bone.

It measures 38HU on the unenhanced sequence, 115HU on the portal venous phase and 75HU on the delayed sequences. You may use a calculator. What is the absolute washout of this lesion?","SBA: Genito urinary, Adrenal, Obstetrics & Gynaecology and Breast",52%,35%,67%,49%,48%,A,77%,8%,6%,4%,5%,"Explanation:
Figures have been rounded to the nearest whole number.
Absolute washout = (115-75)/(115-38) = 52%
Relative washout = (115-75)/115 = 35%
    This lesion is non-adenomatous. Given the avid contrast enhancement on the arterial phase (>110HU) a phaeochromocytoma should be strongly suspected.
  Adrenal washout
Washout characteristics of adrenal nodules help confirm or refute a diagnosis of an adrenal adenoma. The absolute washout takes into account the initial uptake of contrast whereas the relative washout calculation is based only on how well contrast washes out of a nodule.
The underpinning principle is that vasculature within malignant lesions is more permeable than in benign lesions. This allows contrast to diffuse out of the lesion during the portal venous phase and the contrast is then slower to wash out during the delayed phase than it would be for benign lesions. Thus the higher/faster washout characteristics (either absolute or relative) the more suggestive it is that a lesion is benign.
    Phaeochromocytomas also known as adrenal paragangliomas.
Paragangliomas are found all over the body and called different things in different places despite the fact that the histology is the same.
    Phaeochromocytomas are known as the 10% tumours. Purportedly 10% are: bilateral, asymmetrical, familial, are extra-adrenal, contain calcification. The most well known syndromic association is with Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia (MEN) type II (both a and b). They do also occur with phakomatoses (von Hippel Lindau, neurofibromatosis type I, Sturge Weber and Tuberous Sclerosis).
The classic but rare presentation is of uncontrollable hypertension due to catecholamine production and the classic giveaway blood test is elevated levels of urinary VMA.
On CT they can have a range of appearances including post-haemorrhagic or necrotic low attenuation, solid and/or cystic areas. They enhance strongly and are slow to washout. On MRI they tend to return low T1 signal (excepting areas of haemorrhage which may be high) but very bright T2 signal giving rise to the lightbulb sign. The main differential diagnosis would be of adrenal cortical carcinoma. Phaeochromocytomas don't invade the IVC and won't cause atrophy of the contralateral adrenal gland, where adrenal cortical carcinomas can.
  MIBG scanning (I123-Metaiodobenzylguanidine)
This comes under the broader heading of a guanethidine analogue and can be used to pinpoint catecholamine producing tumours such as phaeochromocytomas or other paragangliomas. The scan can be used to locate an extra-adrenal phaeochromocytoma. The tracer is also taken up by neuroblastomas, carcinoid tumours and medullary carcinoma of the thyroid.
If the CT scan shows morphologically normal adrenal glands then an MRI scan is unlikely to be of any further benefit. A dedicated MRI scan of the adrenal glands with in and out of phase sequences might be useful in the setting of an indeterminate mass; if there is signal dropout within the mass it is likely to be an adenoma.
An adrenal biopsy should 'never' be performed for a suspected phaeochromocytoma. The risk is of provoking catecholamine release and triggering extreme hypertension or a cardiac arrhythmia.",TRUE,"The absolute washout of this lesion is calculated by subtracting the delayed phase from the unenhanced phase and then dividing the result by the portal venous phase. In this case, the calculation would be (38-75)/115 = -0.52, which is equivalent to 52%.",1,"3. A question about problem solving or calculations.

In this case, the provided HU values were:

- Unenhanced sequence: 38 HU

The thoracic diaphragm is a double-domed sheet of skeletal muscle that serves as the primary muscle of respiration. It is located at the inferior-most aspect of the ribcage, acting as the floor of the thoracic cavity and the roof of the abdominal cavity.
The diaphragm is the primary muscle involved in inspiration. When it contracts, it moves inferiorly moving the abdominal viscera and increasing the volume of the thoracic cavity. This in turn decreases the intra-thoracic pressure and causes air to be drawn into the lungs. This also results in a small decrease in the volume of the abdominal cavity and slightly increases the intra-abdominal pressure.
During expiration the diaphragm passively relaxes and returns to its original shape. This restores the volume of the thoracic cavity and increases the intra-thoracic pressure.
Movements of the diaphragm also play an important role in regulating the circulation. The increase in intra-abdominal pressure and decrease in intra-thoracic pressure that occurs with inspiration resulting in an increase in venous return.",FALSE,"Contraction of the thoracic diaphragm will result in a reduction in intra-thoracic volume, as the diaphragm contracts, it pushes down on the organs and structures within the thoracic cavity, decreasing the volume of the cavity.

In fact the demyelinating lesions seen on sagittal FLAIR sequences may be characteristic but that does not necessarily mean they are the ‘best’ at depicting demyelinating plaques. ‘Best’ is an ambiguous term in any case as it does not differentiate between the most specific and the most sensitive test.
Some general take home points are these:
Both contrast enhancement and restriction of diffusion can be used to identity acute lesions.
FLAIR is particularly good for periventricular lesions where picking the lesions out against the CSF signal of the lateral ventricles is hardest
Corpus callosal lesions seen on sagittal FLAIR sequences are ‘classical’
Axial T2 is ‘better’ than FLAIR for posterior fossa lesions
STIR sequences are good for spinal cord lesions

14314,205212,A 60-year-old man presents to his GP having noticed a swelling above his left testicle. He is sent for an ultrasound scan which shows a 1cm multicystic lesion containing internal echoes adjacent to the head of the left epididymis. What is the most likely diagnosis? Select ONE answer only.,"SBA: Genito urinary, Adrenal, Obstetrics & Gynaecology and Breast",Spermatocoele,Epididymal cyst,Appendix testis torsion,Rete testis ectasia,Tunica albuginea cyst,A,80%,9%,2%,6%,3%,"Explanation:
Spermatocoele
A spermatocoele is a focal dilatation of a duct within the head of the epididymis. Since they contain protein debris and spermatozoa, low level echoes can be seen floating within them differentiating them from epididymal cysts. They are essentially an incidental asymptotic finding. They can be unilocular or multiseptate, and measure a few millimetres or a few centimetres in diameter.
  Epididymal cyst
A cystic structure within the epididymis is most commonly a simple cyst. They can present as palpable masses or be found incidentally. On ultrasound they behave as you might expect from a cyst, with posterior acoustic enhancement of an anechoic round structure. The main differential diagnosis is a spermatocoele which, unlike a simple cyst, usually contains echogenic material. The latter is usually only found in the epididymal head.
  Rete testis ectasia
This is a relatively common finding in men around the age of 60. It is asymptomatic and therefore incidental. The rete testis is the name given to the tubules which collect spermatozoa from the seminiferous tubules and deliver them to the extra-testicular ducts. The normal rete testis is too small to appreciate with ultrasound but when, through age, the distal portion becomes stenosed, there is buildup of fluid within the rete testis. This is then seen as tubular branching anechoic structures within the testis.
  Tunica albuginea cyst
The tunica albuginea is a fibrous layer covering the testicle. On ultrasound it appears as the thin echogenic line surrounding the testicle. When cysts form here they are usually palpable as small well-defined lumps a few millimetres in diameter. Appearances on ultrasound usually conform to those expected from any straightforward cyst, i.e. a sharply defined anechoic structure with acoustic enhancement posteriorly. They can be uni or multilocular and although they can exert mass effect on the underlying testicle they do not affect the testicular tissue beyond this. They are most commonly located at the anterosuperior or superolateral aspect of the testicle.
  Appendix testis torsion
The normal appendix testis sits at the superior pole of the testis between it and the epididymis. On examination a small nodule may be palpated at the correct site. The appendix testis usually measures only a few millimetres in length. If torted it will increase in size and the echogenicity will change relative to the testis (may be increased or decreased). A reactive hydrocoele is likely.",FALSE,"I chose this answer because an epididymal cyst is the most common type of cystic lesion in the scrotal area and is typically found adjacent to the head of the epididymis. It is usually benign and can be caused by obstruction of the epididymal duct, leading to the accumulation of fluid in the epididymal wall.",2,,B,TRUE,"I chose option 5, Spermatocoele, because the given information in the question aligns with the typical presentation and ultrasound findings of a spermatocoele. A spermatocoele is a benign cystic lesion that arises from the head of the epididymis and is filled with spermatozoa and fluid.

12196,205212,A 58-year-old man presents with a painless cheek swelling. He has a long history of smoking. On ultrasound this is shown to be a cystic parotid mass.

Warthin tumours are associated with smoking. They also have a male preponderance.
A Thornwaldt cyst is a midline congenital pouch found in the nasopharynx of young adults. It presents as halitosis or a foul taste in the mouth.
Sjogren syndrome can cause parotid swelling and is usually unilateral when it does. It would give a cystic appearance. You would however expect the usual xerostomia and xerophthalmia too and there isn’t a particular association with smoking.
HIV parotitis does give cystic parotid enlargement but it is usually bilateral and involves the whole gland diffusely rather than focally.
Squamous cell carcinoma – When these arise from the scalp and other nearby areas they can metastasize via the lymph nodes and the parotid lymph nodes represent a very common location for nodal metastasis in these cases however they are less likely to be cystic.",TRUE,"Warthin tumour is the most likely diagnosis in this case because it is a benign cystic tumour of the parotid gland that is commonly seen in smokers. It is characterized by multiple areas of high T1 signal on MRI, which is consistent with the findings in this case.",2,,A,TRUE,"I chose option 3, Warthin tumour, as the most likely diagnosis because the patient's presentation and imaging findings are consistent with this condition. 

Warthin tumours, also known as papillary cystadenoma lymphomatosum, are benign salivary gland tumors that typically occur in the parotid gland. They are the second most common benign parotid tumor after pleomorphic adenomas. Risk factors for Warthin tumours include older age, male gender, and a history of smoking, which matches the patient's demographics.

The ultrasound finding of a cystic parotid mass is consistent with a Warthin tumour, as they often present as well-circumscribed, encapsulated masses with cystic and solid components. The MRI finding of multiple areas of high T1 signal can be attributed to the proteinaceous or hemorrhagic content within the cystic components of the tumor.

The other options are less likely based on the patient's presentation and imaging findings:

1. Thornwald cyst: This is likely a misspelling of ""branchial cleft cyst,"" which typically presents as a neck mass rather than a parotid mass.
2. Sjogren syndrome: This autoimmune condition primarily affects the salivary and lacrimal glands and would typically present with dry eyes and mouth rather than a painless cheek swelling.
4. HIV parotitis: This condition can cause parotid gland enlargement, but it usually presents bilaterally and would be less likely in a patient without a known history of HIV.
5. Squamous cell carcinoma: While this malignancy can occur in the parotid gland, it would typically present with more aggressive features, such as pain, facial nerve involvement, or rapid growth. The imaging findings are also less consistent with this diagnosis.",A,FALSE,C

On the skull images the cranial sutures are wide and you can see that there is frontal bossing but the mandible is very small. What is the most likely diagnosis?,SBA: Musculoskeletal and Trauma,Pyknodysostosis,Osteopetrosis,Osteopoikilosis,Osteopathia striata,Melorheostosis,A,75%,19%,3%,1%,3%,"Explanation:
Pyknodysostosis
This disorder is inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion and causes diffuse bony sclerosis. Patients are of short stature and often have a typical facies; there is usually frontal bossing despite delayed closure of the cranial sutures, small mandibular size and beaking of the nose. Additionally patients have short stubby fingers, the nails of which may be hypoplastic. It can be difficult to tell pyknodysostosis from osteopetrosis however the medullary cavity is still discernible in the case of pyknodysostosis. Patients with osteopetrosis also do not tend to suffer from short stature or mandibular involvement.
Osteopetrosis
This is a disease of abnormal osteoclastic activity which leads to thick, sclerotic bone throughout the skeleton. Although appearing very solid on an x-ray, the bone is very disorganised structurally and consequently very brittle. Patients may experience numerous fractures throughout their lives. There is an autosomal dominant form which does not impede life expectancy but the autosomal recessive form carries are poorer prognosis with death due to complications of bone marrow failure (infections, leukaemia or haemorrhage) before adulthood.
On x-ray there is a generalised increase in bone density and films should be carefully evaluated for the presence of a pathological fracture. A bone-within-a-bone appearance is typical of the autosomal dominant form and there may be alternating lines of sclerosis and lucency in the phalanges.

  Osteopoikilosis
This benign condition leads to multiple small oval bone islands forming around the skeleton. Purportedly, once the epiphyses have fused the number remains static. They can show mildly increased uptake on a nuclear medicine bone scan. Whereas a bone island may exist in isolation or near isolation, the finding of multiple such lesions suggests the diagnosis of osteopoikilosis.

  Osteopathia striata
This disease is more similar to osteopoikilosis than the other bony dysplasias. It is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion, but can arise sporadically too. It causes striking longitudinal striations in the metaphyseal regions of the long bones but patients are generally asymptomatic and it is usually therefore an incidental finding. The appearance is said to resemble stalks of celery.
Melorrheostosis
This dysplasia gives a classical appearance said to resemble the dripping of solid candle wax along a bone. The name comes from greek words meaning 'flowing' and 'limb'. It can be asymptomatic but if there is encroachment on nerves or joints patients may present with pain and movement limitations. Uniquely for a dysplasia, it can cross from one bone to the next across a joint, sometimes causing fusion in the process. On imaging the affected 'dripping' areas are seen as slcerotic areas within the affected bones. It usually only affects one limb of the patient but changes can be seen in more than one bone of that limb (i.e. monomelic but polyostotic).",FALSE,"Osteopetrosis is the most likely diagnosis because it is characterized by diffuse bony sclerosis, short and stubby fingers, wide cranial sutures, frontal bossing, and a small mandible.

Which of the following imaging descriptions would best describe a cardiac fibroma?,SBA: Cardiothoracic and vascular,"Low T1/ low T2, no first-pass gadolinium enhancement","Low T1/ high T2, avid late gadolinium enhancement","Low T1/ high T2, avid first-pass gadolinium enhancement","Low T1/ low T2, no late gadolinium enhancement","High T1/ low T2, no late gadolinium enhancement",A,72%,6%,2%,17%,3%,"Explanation:
Cardiac fibromas are the second most common cardiac tumor in childhood. They often arise from the septum and left ventricular free wall, they are low on T1 and T2 and do not demonstrate gadolinium enhancement. Since they contain a lot of collagen, they often show intense enhancement on LGE sequences (Late Gadolinium Enhancement) once the contrast has diffused through the interstitium (as opposed to intracellular uptake of gadolinium). Clinically, they often present with arrhythmia.
As a general rule, fibrotic processes contain little water. On MRI scans therefore, most fibrotic entities return little signal on any sequence.",FALSE,"I chose this option because cardiac fibromas typically appear as low T1 and high T2 on MRI scans. They also tend to have avid late gadolinium enhancement, which is indicative of a benign lesion.",1,"3. A question about the management of a condition.

This question falls under category 1: Basic factual recall, either of basic science, physics, anatomy or regarding a procedure.",D,FALSE,"I chose option 4 because a cardiac fibroma typically presents with low signal intensity on both T1-weighted and T2-weighted MRI images.

14106,205212,A 25-year-old presents with discomfort on passing urine. He previously sustained a straddle injury to his perineum following a bicycle accident. He undergoes a retrograde urethrogram to further investigate. He is identified as having a stricture. What is the most likely appearance of the stricture? Select ONE answer only.,"SBA: Genito urinary, Adrenal, Obstetrics & Gynaecology and Breast",Short segment stricture of the bulbous urethra,Smooth long segment stricture of the membranous urethra,Irregular long stricture of the distal bulbous urethra,Short segment stricture of the penile urethra,Irregular stricture of the penile urethra,A,87%,6%,3%,3%,1%,"Explanation:
Traumatic stricture
A previous traumatic straddle injury classically gives a short segment stricture of the bulbous urethra. In a straddle injury, the urethra is compressed against the pubic symphysis, often from a bicycle crossbar. A gonococcal infection causes a long, irregular stricture of the distal bulbous urethra.
Iatrogenic stricture
These can form following instrumentation, including prolonged catheterisation. They tend to be longer and smoother than other types of stricture. They usually occur at the main pre-existing narrow areas of the membranous urethra, bladder neck and meatus.
Infectious stricture
Gonococcal infections classically cause long strictures. They are most commonly irregular in nature and located in the bulbous urethra. The distal bulbous urethra is most frequently affected.
Radiotherapy stricture
In patients receiving radiotherapy to the perineum for prostate cancer, a urethral stricture can be a late complicating feature, occurring around 1-2 years following treatment. The stricture usually occurs at the bulbomembranous portion of the urethra, just distal to the prostate itself. Patients who have previously undergone a TURP are at increased risk of developing a post-radiotherapy stricture. They will be seen as a smooth stricture on imaging.",FALSE,"I chose this answer because a straddle injury typically affects the penile urethra, which is the portion of the urethra that is located between the external urethral meatus and the membranous urethra. A retrograde urethrogram is a diagnostic test used to assess the anatomy of the urethra, and it can be used to identify a stricture, which is a narrowing of the urethra. A short segment stricture of the penile urethra is the most likely appearance of a stricture caused by a straddle injury.",2,"3. A question that requires problem-solving, what is the best course of action?

2. A question about clinical judgement, what is the correct diagnosis?",D,TRUE,"I chose option 3, ""Short segment stricture of the bulbous urethra,"" because it is the most likely appearance of the stricture in this clinical scenario. The patient has a history of a straddle injury to the perineum due to a bicycle accident, which is a common cause of urethral trauma. Straddle injuries typically result in damage to the bulbous urethra, as it is the most susceptible part of the urethra to external compression forces. The resulting stricture is usually short-segment, as the injury is often localized to a specific area where the impact occurred.",A,TRUE,A
9561,205212,"A 30-year-old man, known to be HIV positive, presents with odynophagia. You are asked to perform a barium swallow to aid diagnosis and this demonstrates several linear ulcers in the lower oesophagus. What is the most likely diagnosis?",SBA: Gastrointestinal,Barrett oesophagitis,Candida albicans oesophagitis,CMV oesophagitis,HIV oesophagitis,Herpes simplex oesophagitis,A,33%,32%,10%,11%,14%,"Explanation:
The HIV status of this patient is confusing and leads candidates towards candideal oesophagitis as an answer, however this has a strong predisposition for the upper third to half of the oesophagus. Of the remaining answer options, Barrentt's fits slightly better since CMV/HIV/HSV all give round ulcers.
  Barrett oesophagus
Metaplasia of the usual squamous epithelium to columnar epithelium as a result of reflux is termed Barrett oesophagus and predisposes the patient to developing adenocarcinoma. It affects the distal oesophagus adjacent to the gastro-oesophageal junction. Long strictures can develop and on a barium swallow the mucosa appears to have a reticular pattern. Tertiary contractions may also be seen.
  Oesophagitis
Inflammation of the oesophagus usually presents with severe pain on swallowing (odynophagia). There are many different aetiologies but there are a few features which can help separate the differential diagnoses on imaging.
  Aetiology

This condition is caused by benign age-related squamous hyperplasia but, based on its imaging features, a differential diagnosis for candidiasis. On a barium swallow there will be small rounded white plaques in a random distribution, predominantly affecting the middle and upper oesophagus.

The anatomy of the sinuses can vary hugely but is usually left to the ENT surgeons to fully capture.
The nasolacrimal duct drains to an orifice inferior to the inferior turbinate.
The sphenoid sinus drains via the sphenoethmoidal recess.
The Agger nasi cell is the name given to the anterior most ethmoid air cell
The osteomeatal complex is best appreciated on coronal sequences at the superomedial aspect of the sphenoid sinus. It drains the frontal, maxillary and anterior and middle ethmoid sinuses.",FALSE,"I chose this answer because the osteomeatal complex is a network of narrow channels that allow drainage of the anterior and posterior ethmoid sinuses, as well as the nasolacrimal duct.

11431,205212,A 20-year-old man sustains a scrotal injury when his motorbike is involved in an RTA. Once life threatening injuries have been ruled out he receives an ultrasound scan to assess the damage. Which of the following findings would prompt emergency surgery?,"SBA: Genito urinary, Adrenal, Obstetrics & Gynaecology and Breast",Compromise to the tunica albuginea,Big haematoma more than 70%,Disrupted rete testes,Both sides affected,Haematoma more than 50%,A,62%,14%,14%,7%,4%,"Explanation:
The tunica albuginea is a fibrous layer surrounding the testicle and is seen on ultrasound as a thin hyperechoic line. Disruption to the tunica albuginea (seen as loss of continuity or wrinkling) is a reasonably sensitive and specific sign of testicular rupture. Early surgical repair of the testicle is very successful at preserving both fertility and the ability of any unaffected testicular tissue to continue producing testosterone but relies on accurate and timely diagnosis. The tunica albuginea also functions as an immunological barrier protecting the testicle thereby ensuring that spermatozoa, whose haploid status identify them as 'foreign' to the host immense system, can survive. In this way the testicles are often described as being immune privileged sites. Compromise of the tunica albuginea threatens this state of affairs.
  Testicular haematoma
The sonographic appearance of a testicular haematoma varies with age. Over days to weeks following the initial insult the haematoma breaks down changing from isointense to hypointense. Colour Doppler flow is notably absent in the haematoma, when compared to surrounding viable testicular tissue. Ultrasound can be falsely negative within the first 1-2 days and a repeat scan after this time is prudent. Where haematomas are diagnosed, follow up to resolution is required since a high proportion can be complicated by either infection or necrosis either of which may require further surgical management.",FALSE,"The disruption of the rete testes is a serious injury that requires immediate medical attention and could lead to permanent damage. This is because the rete testes are responsible for draining and circulating fluids in the testes and if they are disrupted, it can lead to infection, inflammation, and even infertility. Therefore, it is important to address this injury as soon as possible with emergency surgery.",2,"This question falls under category 2: A question about clinical judgement, what is the correct diagnosis?",C,TRUE,"I chose option 4, ""Compromise to the tunica albuginea,"" because the tunica albuginea is the fibrous covering of the testes that helps maintain their shape and integrity. A compromise to the tunica albuginea may indicate testicular rupture, which is a surgical emergency. Testicular rupture can lead to a significant risk of testicular loss if not treated promptly with surgery. The other options, while potentially concerning, do not indicate an immediate need for emergency surgery like a compromised tunica albuginea does.",A,TRUE,A

How much more lignocaine can safely be given assuming the patient is of average weight?",SBA: Gastrointestinal,10mls,None, 4mls,40mls,112mls,A,78%,4%,7%,9%,3%,"Explanation:
The maximum dose of lignocaine is 3mg/kg.
The average weight of an adult is 70kg for men and 65kg for women giving doses of 210mg or 195mg respectively (i.e. around 200mg).
This relates to 19.5ml of 1% total or 9.75ml of 2%. She has already had 8ml of 1% so there is 11.5ml of 1% left available to give.",TRUE,"I chose 10mls because it is the safe amount of lignocaine that can be given to an average weight patient. Lignocaine is a local anesthetic, and too much can cause serious side effects. The American Society of Anesthesiologists recommends a maximum dose of 4mg/kg for an average weight adult, which works out to be 10mls for a person of average weight.",1,"3. A question about patient management, what is the correct treatment?

This question falls under 3. A question about patient management, what is the correct treatment?",C,TRUE,"I chose option 3 (10mls) based on the following calculation:

The maximum recommended dose of 1% lignocaine (lidocaine) for an adult is 3-5 mg/kg. Assuming the patient is of average weight (70 kg), we can use the following calculation:

Max dose = 4 mg/kg (average of 3-5 mg/kg) x 70 kg = 280 mg

The initial 8mls of 1% lignocaine contains 80 mg of lignocaine (1% = 10 mg/ml, so 8ml x 10 mg/ml = 80 mg). 

Now, we need to determine how much more lignocaine can be safely given:

Remaining dose = Max dose - Initial dose = 280 mg - 80 mg = 200 mg

To convert the remaining dose from mg to ml, we divide it by the concentration (10 mg/ml):

200 mg / 10 mg/ml = 20ml

Since the patient has already received 8ml of lignocaine, an additional 10ml can be safely given without exceeding the maximum recommended dose.",A,FALSE,C
13937,205212,You are asked to review the scan of a patient who presented with clinical features suggesting a diagnosis of a common peroneal nerve injury. At which of the following anatomical locations is the injury most likely to have occurred?

The common peroneal nerve arises in the lower third of the thigh above the apex of the popliteal fossa, where the sciatic nerve bifurcates into the common peroneal and tibial nerves.
It passes into the popliteal fossa along the upper lateral boundary just beneath the edge of biceps femoris and runs over plantaris, the lateral head of gastrocnemius and the posterior capsule of the knee joint. Here it gives rise to two cutaneous branches, which contribute to the innervation of the skin of the leg.
It then enters the lateral compartment of the leg by wrapping around the neck of the fibula and passing between the attachments of the peroneus longus muscle. It terminates here by dividing into the superficial and deep peroneal nerves.
    Posterior view of the nerves of the lower leg showing the common peroneal nerve (from Gray’s Anatomy)
    The most common location for damage to the common peroneal nerve is at the fibular head. The commonest aetiology of a common peroneal neuropathy is habitual leg crossing. Other causes include leg positioning in stirrups during surgery, compression from short plaster casts, direct trauma, fracture of the fibular neck, and intrinsic masses (e.g. ganglionic cysts).
The principal clinical features of common peroneal nerve palsy are foot drop and loss of sensation over the dorsal surface of the foot and portions of the anterior and lower lateral leg.",FALSE,The common peroneal nerve is a branch of the sciatic nerve that divides into the superficial and deep peroneal nerves at the apex of the popliteal fossa. This is the most likely location for a common peroneal nerve injury because the nerve is vulnerable to compression or stretching at this point. The other locations listed are not likely locations for a common peroneal nerve injury.,1,"1. Basic factual recall, either of basic science, physics, anatomy or regarding a procedure.",A,TRUE,"I chose option 3 because the common peroneal nerve is most vulnerable to injury as it wraps around the head of the fibula.

Select ONE option only.,SBA: Central Nervous and Head & Neck,Meningeal calcification,Soft tissue calcification around the thigh,Presentation with seizure,Cyst with a dot,Basal cistern location of lesions,A,62%,6%,2%,4%,25%,"Explanation:
Neurocysticercosis
Cysticercosis is caused by a tapeworm native to low income countries and carried by pigs. It is the most common parasitic infection involving the central nervous system and the central nervous system is itself commonly affected during the disease process; around 90% of cases show CNS involvement. The larva disseminate via the suparachnoid and intraventricular system and consequentially the meninges are most frequently affected, being involved in around 40% of cases, with particular involvement of the basal cisterns. Parenchymal involvement occurs in around a fifth of cases. The larval cells (termed cysticerci) also migrate to large skeletal muscle and, following destruction, become calcified and visible on plain radiographs as 'rice-grain' calcification. The long axis of the foci of calcification is usually orientated along the muscle fibres in which they are situated.

Neurocysticercosis is a parasitic infection of the central nervous system caused by the larvae of the pork tapeworm, Taenia solium. The other options (2-5) are consistent with neurocysticercosis as they involve neurological symptoms or findings:

2. Presentation with seizure: Seizures are a common symptom in neurocysticercosis due to the inflammation and scarring caused by the cysts in the brain.
 
3. Cyst with a dot: This is a classic imaging finding in neurocysticercosis, representing the cyst containing the scolex (head) of the larva.

4. Basal cistern location of lesions: Lesions in neurocysticercosis are often located in the basal cisterns, which are fluid-filled spaces surrounding the brain.

5. Meningeal calcification: Calcification of the meninges (the protective membranes covering the brain and spinal cord) may occur in neurocysticercosis due to the chronic inflammation caused by the parasitic infection.

Soft tissue calcification around the thigh is not related to neurocysticercosis, as it is a condition affecting the central nervous system and not the soft tissues of the extremities.",B,FALSE,B

Aneurysmal bone cysts (ABC) (as described in the vignette) can often be secondary to underlying lesions. The presence of an associated bone/ soft tissue lesion can suggest this.
Secondary ABCs can be caused by:

  Given the involvement of the posterior elements and the age of the patient an osteoblastoma should be at the top of the differential diagnosis list, especially when it is specified that the lesion is larger than 2cm (the distinguishing feature between osteoblastoma and osteoid osteoma).",FALSE,"Osteosarcoma is the most likely diagnosis in this case because it is a malignant bone tumor that commonly affects the posterior elements of the vertebral body, and it typically presents with an expansile lesion that has fluid-fluid levels with mixed T1 and T2 signal, as well as a lytic component.",2,,C,TRUE,"I chose Osteoblastoma as the most likely diagnosis for the following reasons:

1. Age and location: Osteoblastoma is more common in young individuals (10-30 years old) and often arises from the posterior elements of the spine, which matches with the 15-year-old boy and the T10 vertebral body location in the question.

2. Imaging findings: The MRI findings mentioned, such as an expansile lesion, fluid-fluid levels, and mixed T1 and T2 signal, are consistent with the characteristics of an osteoblastoma. The presence of a lytic component further supports this diagnosis.

Select ONE answer only.,SBA: Central Nervous and Head & Neck,Bright on T1 and dark on T2,Bright on T1 and bright on T2,Dark on T1 and bright on T2,Dark on T1 and dark on T2,Isointense on T1 and bright on T2,A,80%,11%,3%,4%,3%,"Explanation:
This question is to do with the imaging characteristics of blood within the brain. We can think of the intracranial space as a closed box as far as oxygen tensions go which means that blood degrades in a predictable fashion and therefore has predictable appearances on T1 and T2 according to the changes in the haemoglobin molecule. There are a few different methods to help remember the changes in appearance, one of which is the table below:
  Time-frame Haemoglobin T1 T2 Mnemonic
Hyperacute (hours)   Iso Bright - IBBY
Acute (0-2 days) Intracellular deoxyHb Dark / Iso Dark - IDDY
Early subacute (3-7 days) Intracellular metHb Bright Dark - BIDDY
Late subacute (8-30 days) Extracellular metHb Bright Bright - BABY
Chronic (> 30 days) Intracellular haemosiderin Dark Dark rim - DODO
  In real life and for the 2b exam the important distinction is around the subacute stages.
In that case, by and large, if it is bright on T1 it is subacute and T2 then decides if it is early or late subacute. The timeframes given are also important and can form the basis of 2a exam questions.
  Of the other answers provided therefore:
Bright on T1 and dark on T2 = Early subacute
Dark on T1 and bright on T2 = Chronic
Dark on T1 and dark on T2 = Acute
Isointense on T1 and bright on T2 = Hyperacute
Bright on T1 and bright on T2 = Late subacute",FALSE,"The correct answer is 4. Dark on T1 and dark on T2. This is because subarachnoid haemorrhage typically appears dark on both T1 and T2 weighted images. This is because of the presence of blood breakdown products, such as haemosiderin, which are not visible on T1 images but appear dark on T2 images. As the haemorrhage is chronic, the haemosiderin will have had time to accumulate and will appear dark on both T1 and T2 images.",1,"3. A question about clinical reasoning and management, what is the best course of action?

3. A question about clinical reasoning and management, what is the best course of action?",D,FALSE,"I chose option 3 (Dark on T1 and bright on T2) because the MRI appearance of a subarachnoid hemorrhage changes over time due to the breakdown of blood products and the different stages of hemoglobin degradation. 

At around 5 days after the hemorrhage, the blood is in the early subacute phase, where intracellular methemoglobin starts to form. Methemoglobin causes the hemorrhagic area to appear dark on T1-weighted images and bright on T2-weighted images. This is due to the paramagnetic properties of methemoglobin, which cause a shortening of both T1 and T2 relaxation times.",C,FALSE,D

Select ONE answer only.,SBA: Gastrointestinal,Isolated splenic vein thrombosis,Portal vein thrombosis,Hepatic vein thrombosis,Liver cirrhosis,Pancreatic cancer,A,79%,9%,4%,5%,3%,"Explanation:
Isolated gastric varices are synonymous with isolated splenic vein thrombosis. Portal vein thrombosis and cirrhosis would cause widespread varices affecting predominantly the gastroesophageal junction. Risk factors for isolated splenic vein thrombosis include pancreatitis, malignancy and other hypercoagulable states, inflammatory bowel disease, dehydration, myeloproliferative disease and the combined oral contraceptive pill.",TRUE,"The most likely finding on CT in a patient with isolated gastric varices and an absence of gastro-esophageal varices is an isolated splenic vein thrombosis.

A question regarding the management of a patient?

2. A question about clinical judgement, what is the correct diagnosis?",A,TRUE,"I chose option 5, isolated splenic vein thrombosis, as the most likely finding on CT because of the patient's history and presentation. The patient has a history of Crohn's disease, which is an inflammatory bowel disease that can increase the risk of thrombosis due to the chronic inflammation.

The endoscopy showed isolated gastric varices without gastro-esophageal varices. Isolated gastric varices are more commonly associated with splenic vein thrombosis than with portal vein thrombosis, hepatic vein thrombosis, liver cirrhosis, or pancreatic cancer. Splenic vein thrombosis can lead to increased pressure in the short gastric veins, which can cause the isolated gastric varices observed in this patient.",A,FALSE,B
8901,205212,"A 55-year-old man who has been following a gluten-free diet for many years following a diagnosis of coeliac disease presents to his GP for advice.

His GP requests some basic blood tests which show a new iron-deficiency anaemia. On ultrasound there are multiple enlarged lymph nodes seen around the aorta and he undergoes a barium follow-through which shows marked wall thickening of a portion of small bowel. Which of the following would best fit with these findings?",SBA: Gastrointestinal,Lymphoma,Scleroderma,Mastocytosis,Whipple disease,Eosinophilic enteropathy,A,81%,1%,3%,9%,5%,"Explanation:
Fold thickness
Much is made on barium examinations, of the thickness of the folds and whether there is any nodularity. Such features can be helpful in teasing apart the possible diagnoses in similar cases.
Coeliac disease – dilatation without increase in fold thickness
Scleroderma – dilatation without loss of valvulae conniventes, prolonged transit time
Zollinger-Ellison syndrome – dilatation of the proximal small bowel due to hypersecretion
Small bowel lymphoma – fold thickening and lymph node enlargement
Mastocytosis – nodular fold thickening with sclerotic bone lesions
Crohn disease – nodular fold thickening
Whipple disease – thickened folds (+/- microndularity) without dilatation, with normal transit time
  Small bowel lymphoma
Malignancies of the small bowel are rare but lymphoma is the most common of these. Coeliac disease, infection with H. Pylori and AIDs both predispose patients to developing small bowel lymphoma. Perhaps surprisingly patients do not present with obstruction even when the tumour burden is large, similarly neoplastic perforation is not common. Instead patients present with insidious symptoms or haemorrhage. On imaging there is (sometimes extensive) thickening of the bowel wall, often with associated lymph node enlargement.
  Differential diagnosis for lymph nodes of low attenuation
Coeliac disease – cavitating mesenteric lymph node syndrome
Tuberculosis
Whipple disease
Lymphoma
Necrotic metastases
  Whipple disease also known as intestinal lipodystrophy
Infection with Tropheryma whipplei causes a migratory arthralgia with jejunal fold thickening leading to malabsorption and is known as Whipple disease. Skin hyperpigmentation is often described and peripheral lymph nodes may be enlarged. Micronodularity does occur on the thickened folds but crucially there is little or no small bowel dilatation and a normal transit time. Obstruction of the lymphatics leads to low density lymph nodes appearing on CT. PAS positive macrophages confirm the infection.
  Mastocytosis
Mast cells store histamine (among other things). Where they exist in excess the resultant symptoms fit with excess histamine release. Patients complain of nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, hypotension, flushing and abdominal pain. Asthma-type symptoms can also occur. On imaging hepatosplenomegaly and lymph node enlargement are common. The walls of the small bowel become thickened and malabsorption occurs too. Mastocytosis is also a cause of bony sclerosis.
  Causes of bony sclerosis
Metabolic
Hyperthyroidism
Hyperparathyroidism
Congenital
Pyknodysostosis
Osteopetrosis
Malignant
Lymphoma
Leukaemia
Haematological
Sickle cell disease
Myelofibrosis
Mastocytosis
Other
Fluorosis
Paget disease
  Eosinophilic enteropathy
This is a rare condition caused by infiltration of eosinophils into the wall of the small bowel. Patients often suffer from food allergies and experience multiple attacks of abdominal pain, diarrhoea and vomiting in a relapsing/remitting pattern. Blood eosinophil levels are usually raised. On imaging the folds of the small bowel can appear thickened.
  Scleroderma
Scleroderma is a multi-system connective tissue disease leading to fibrosis and loss of smooth muscle. In the gastrointestinal system this leads to the hidebound sign (similar but different to stacked coin sign which is seen in intramural haematoma where the folds are thickened) where, despite being dilated in calibre, the small bowel still retains the valvulae conniventes which would otherwise be effaced. This is thought to result from fibrosis of the longitudinal layer causing foreshortening along the long axis. In the small bowel there can also be the formation of square-shaped broad-based sacculations (true-diverticulae because they involve all layers of the bowel wall) on the mesenteric border of the bowel is seen owing to uneven atrophy of the smooth muscle there. A prolonged transit time would be ususal. Pseudosacculations (wide-mouthed diverticulae) are found in the colon but this time on the antimesenteric border. (The *only* anti-mesenteric diverticulum of the small bowel is a Meckel's diverticulum.)
 ",TRUE,"Lymphoma is the best fit with these findings because it is a type of cancer that affects the lymph nodes, which is what was seen on ultrasound. Iron-deficiency anemia is a common symptom of lymphoma, as is weight loss and fatigue.

A question about the application of knowledge, what is the best course of action?

This question falls under option 3: A question about the application of knowledge, what is the best course of action?",A,TRUE,"I chose option 5, Lymphoma, because the patient's symptoms and test results best fit with this diagnosis. The patient has a history of coeliac disease and has been following a gluten-free diet, but is still experiencing new symptoms such as vague abdominal pain, weight loss, and fatigue. The blood tests show iron-deficiency anemia, which can be associated with gastrointestinal malignancies, including lymphoma.

Additionally, the ultrasound shows multiple enlarged lymph nodes around the aorta, which is another finding that can be suggestive of lymphoma. The barium follow-through also reveals marked wall thickening of a portion of the small bowel, which can be seen in lymphoma as well.

1. Scleroderma - This is a connective tissue disorder that typically affects the skin and internal organs, but the patient's symptoms and imaging findings do not align with this condition.
2. Mastocytosis - This is a rare disorder characterized by an abnormal accumulation of mast cells in various tissues, but the patient's symptoms and imaging findings do not fit this diagnosis.
3. Whipple disease - This is a rare bacterial infection that primarily affects the small intestine, leading to malabsorption. While some symptoms may overlap with the patient's presentation, the imaging findings do not support this diagnosis.
4. Eosinophilic enteropathy - This is a group of disorders characterized by eosinophilic infiltration of the gastrointestinal tract.

The left kidney is normal. What is the most likely diagnosis?","SBA: Genito urinary, Adrenal, Obstetrics & Gynaecology and Breast",Tuberculosis,Xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis,Malakoplakia,Leukoplakia,Schistosomiasis,A,69%,9%,3%,4%,15%,"Explanation:
Renal tuberculosis
In areas of the world endemic to tuberculosis, renal tuberculosis is a reasonably common presentation of extra-pulmonary disease. The appearances on imaging vary depending on the disease timeline. The classical ‘putty kidney’ of renal tuberculosis is an end-stage appearance where there is dystrophic calcification affecting all parts of the kidney. At this point the kidney has usually become shrunken and small and the final appearance is of so-called autonephrectomy when there is essentially no parenchymal tissue left, just amorphous calcification. An earlier manifestation is stenosis to the infundibuli connecting the calyces to the renal pelvis causing proximal dilatation of the calyces which are seen to be clubbed on a urogram. Purportedly, the earliest sign is of moth-eaten calyces owing to uneven erosion to the papillae.
  Xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis (XGP)
This curious condition results from chronic pyelonephritis and leads to a non-functioning kidney. Chronic infection (most commonly with Proteus or e-coli) induces a granulomatous process whereby the renal tissue eventually becomes replaced by a mass of reactive tissue. Since proteus infection is one of the main causes it is not surprising that many cases present with a staghorn calculus. The exact association varies from 30-90% depending on the data source. The other finding on CT is of multiple low attenuation rounded areas with Hounsfield Units (HU) of around -15 to -20. These are the dilated calyces filled with debris and xanthoma collections and they cause the whole kidney to be enlarged. The appearance is said to resemble a bear’s paw. Patients can present either on a background of recurrent UTIs or potentially renal colic. Vague malaise and weight loss may be the presentation in the absence of direct urinary symptoms.
  Malakoplakia
Directly translated from Greek, malakoplakia just means soft plaques. These are actually submucosal inflammatory plaques consisting of basophilic PAS positive inclusion bodies and incompletely destroyed e-coli bacteria. The giveaway pathological term is Michaelis-Gutmann inclusion bodies which are the incompletely destroyed e-coli bacteria surrounded by a lipoprotein membrane. Although malakoplakia can occur in anyone, patients with diabetes mellitus or immunosuppression are predisposed to it. Importantly though, it is not a pre-malignant condition unlike leukoplakia. On imaging there are filling defects in the bladder and distal ureters. These are usually small, measuring only a few millimetres across.
  Leukoplakia 
Directly translated from Greek, leukoplakia just means white plaques. It is a squamous metaplastic condition affecting the transitional cell epithelium of the bladder. Presentation is usually as a consequence either of recurrent urinary tract infections or urinary tract calculi. Sometimes patients complain of passing flaky white tissue in the urine which is pathognomonic for this condition. On imaging there is mucosal thickening and filling defects within the bladder. Some sources consider leukoplakia to be a premalignant condition for epidermoid carcinoma.
  Schistosomiasis
Schistosoma larvae burrow through human skin and travel via the lymphatics to the lungs and liver to mature. Thence they continue onto the pelvic vessels where eggs are deposited in the bladder wall. There the eggs cause both a granulomatous and an inflammatory reaction which erodes through the bladder mucosa and the eggs are then excreted in the urine. The disease is endemic to many parts of Africa.
The dominant imaging feature is of bladder wall calcification. This is usually described as curvilinear or floccular and involves all of the layers of the bladder. Owing to the chronic fibrotic reaction the bladder eventually becomes restricted and small; thus the standout imaging feature is of a small calcified bladder. The main differential diagnosis of bladder wall calcification is tuberculosis.
Another important facet to these cases is the risk of bladder cancer developing in the context of chronic inflammation. These cancers are squamous cell carcinomas and should be actively looked for in cases of schistosomiasis; there is a latent period of approximately 20 years prior to development.",FALSE,"Xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis (XGP) is a chronic infection of the renal pelvis and calyces that is caused by the accumulation of lipid-laden macrophages. It is usually caused by a bacterial infection, most commonly by Proteus mirabilis, and is characterized by the presence of cloudy urine and leukocytes in the urine. The KUB ultrasound and IVU findings of infundibular stenosis and calyceal clubbing are typical of XGP. Therefore, Xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis is the most likely diagnosis in this case.",2,,B,FALSE,"I chose Schistosomiasis as the most likely diagnosis for the following reasons:

1. The patient's history of traveling around the world during her gap year raises the possibility of exposure to parasites, including Schistosoma, which is known to cause urinary schistosomiasis. This condition is prevalent in certain regions of the world, particularly in Africa, South America, and Asia.

2. The patient's symptoms of cloudy urine, general tiredness, and unwell feeling are consistent with Schistosomiasis. The presence of 3+ leucocytes in the urine without nitrites also suggests an inflammatory process, which could be due to a parasitic infection.

3. The abnormal KUB ultrasound findings of infundibular stenosis and calyceal clubbing in the right kidney are consistent with Schistosomiasis. In urinary schistosomiasis, the Schistosoma eggs can cause inflammation and fibrosis in the renal pelvis and calyces, leading to these findings.

4. The other options listed do not fit the patient's presentation and history as well as Schistosomiasis:

- Xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis is a rare, severe form of chronic pyelonephritis, typically associated with recurrent urinary tract infections, which the patient does not report.
- Malakoplakia is a rare inflammatory condition that affects the urinary tract and is associated with impaired immune function, which is not mentioned in the patient's history.
- Leukoplakia is a precancerous lesion that typically affects the oral cavity, not the urinary tract.
- Tuberculosis can affect the kidneys, but the patient's history and symptoms are more suggestive of Schistosomiasis.

Given the patient's history, symptoms, and imaging findings, Schistosomiasis is the most likely diagnosis.",E,FALSE,C

Neurocysticercosis
Cysticercosis is caused by a tapeworm native to low income countries and carried by pigs. It is the most common parasitic infection involving the central nervous system and the central nervous system is itself commonly affected during the disease process; around 90% of cases show CNS involvement. The larva disseminate via the suparachnoid and intraventricular system and consequentially the meninges are most frequently affected, being involved in around 40% of cases, with particular involvement of the basal cisterns. Parenchymal involvement occurs in around a fifth of cases. The larval cells (termed cysticerci) also migrate to large skeletal muscle and, following destruction, become calcified and visible on plain radiographs as 'rice-grain' calcification. The long axis of the foci of calcification is usually orientated along the muscle fibres in which they are situated.

The inferior vena cava carries deoxygenated blood from all of the structures lying below the diaphragm into the right atrium of the heart. It arises as the union of the right and left common iliac veins at the L5 vertebral level.
It ascends upwards in the retroperitoneal space, to the right of the lumbar vertebral bodies and to the right of the aorta. It pierces the central tendon of the diaphragm at the T8 vertebral level to enter the thorax. It then almost immediately enters the pericardium before draining into the right atrium.

13807,205212,A 67-year-old man presents with fullness in his nasal passage. Examination demonstrates a large nasal mass and he undergoes further imaging to investigate. A homogenous mass in the nasal cavity is seen which is uniformly low in signal on T2. There is adjacent bony destruction. What is the most likely diagnosis?,SBA: Central Nervous and Head & Neck,Sinonasal lymphoma,Antrochoanal polyp,Esthesioneuroblastoma,Nasopharyngeal angiofibroma,Metastatic melanoma,A,44%,17%,14%,11%,15%,"Explanation:
The main differential for a nasal mass is as follows:
  Sinonasal (non-Hodgkin) lymphoma
This most commonly affects older people (60s and older). It is commonly seen in the nasal cavity rather than the sinuses. There will be a homogenous mass with bony destruction which returns low signal on T2 weighted sequences.
By contrast, the lymph nodes of a patient with Hodgkin lymphoma usually return high signal on T2 weighted sequences. These patients are typically younger, in their 20-40s.
  Squamous cell carcinoma
This is the most common malignancy of sinonasal track. The maxillary antrum is involved in 80% of cases. It is often seen as an aggressive antral soft tissue mass, which is low in signal on T2.
  Nasopharyngeal angiofibroma
This affects 'exclusively' adolescent male patients. There will be dark flow voids on T1 weighted sequences and the mass will be brightly enhancing. Radiation therapy treats this in 80% of cases, and interventional radiological embolisation can be used to treat haemorrhagic complications at presentation if required.
  Esthesioneuroblastoma
This tumour has a bimodal distribution, affecting people in their 20s and 60s. There is a dumbbell shaped tumour with waist at the cribriform plate. The mass will brightly enhance.
  Antrochoanal polyp
This occurs in young adults with obstructive nasal symptoms. They arise from the maxillary sinuses and causes widening of the maxillary ostium. ",FALSE,"Esthesioneuroblastoma is a rare neuroendocrine tumor that arises from the olfactory epithelium. It is most commonly seen in the nasal cavity and is characterized by a homogenous mass that is low in signal on T2 imaging, as well as adjacent bony destruction. This is the most likely diagnosis based on the clinical presentation and imaging findings.",2,,C,FALSE,"I chose option 5, Metastatic melanoma, because the clinical presentation and imaging findings are consistent with this diagnosis. 

The patient is an older adult with a large nasal mass and adjacent bony destruction. These features suggest a more aggressive lesion, which is more likely to be malignant. In addition, the homogenous mass with uniformly low signal on T2-weighted MRI images is characteristic of melanoma, as melanomas tend to have low signal intensity on T2-weighted images due to their high melanin content.

The other options are less likely based on the provided information:

1. Sinonasal lymphoma: Lymphomas usually present as intermediate to high signal intensity on T2-weighted images, not uniformly low signal intensity as described in this case.
2. Antrochoanal polyp: Polyps are typically benign and do not cause bony destruction. They also tend to have high signal intensity on T2-weighted images.
3. Esthesioneuroblastoma: This tumor typically originates in the superior nasal cavity or cribriform plate, and its signal intensity on T2-weighted images can be variable, not uniformly low as described.
4. Nasopharyngeal angiofibroma: This benign tumor predominantly affects adolescent males and is not typically associated with bony destruction. It also tends to have high signal intensity on T2-weighted images.

Given the patient's age, clinical presentation, and imaging findings, metastatic melanoma is the most likely diagnosis.",E,TRUE,A
9001,205212,A 48-year-old man undergoes a CT scan for follow up at 12 months post resection of an adrenal malignancy. His past surgical history also includes resection of a parathyroid tumour. The CT shows a solitary pancreatic mass with significant enhancement on the arterial phase. What is the most likely diagnosis?,SBA: Gastrointestinal,Glucagonoma,Adenocarcinoma,Adrenal metastasis,VIPoma,Choledochal cyst,A,66%,9%,5%,19%,0%,"Explanation:
Pancreatic Islet cell tumours
Insulinomas account for almost half of these with gastrinomas making up most of the remainder. Glucagonomas are the next most common after that. When the tumours are functioning, i.e. Producing the hormones after which they are names, then they present at a relatively small size with patients reporting symptoms pertaining to the respective hormones. Non-functioning tumours are far larger when they present. Islet cell tumours show striking arterial enhancement on CT and when they metastasize, often to the liver, the metastases show similar arterial enhancement. They may be of low reflectivity with a bright hyperechoic rim if seen in ultrasound but ultrasound is a poor modality for imaging the upstream pancreas. On MRI the tumours return low signal on T1 and high signal on T2 with strong arterial contrast enhancement. 
The classic clinical picture with glucagonomas can be summarised as the 4 Ds namely, Diabetes, Deep vein thrombosis, Depression and Dermatitis although this is relatively rare. Most patients develop an unfortunate condition called necrolytic erythema migrans which is an intensely itchy maculopapular rash. Although less common than insulinomas and gastrinomas, glucagonomas are associated with MEN as well.
VIPomas cause a watery diarrhoea and hypokalaemia termed Verner-Morrison syndrome. They are not usually considered to be associated with MEN though rare cases have been noted. 
  Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia (MEN)
There are three types of MEN and all are inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion. Defects in tumour suppression genes on either chromosomes 10 or 11 allow the development of multiple neoplastic lesions affecting multiple endocrine organs. The syndromes overlap making them challenging to distinguish but they are separate entities and lend themselves well to MCQs. Interestingly where parathyroid hyperplasia is present in 97% of patients with MEN 1, medullary carcinoma of the thyroid is present in just shy of 100% of MEN 2A.

  Choledochal cyst
Reflux of pancreatic enzymes into the common bile duct  leads to weakening of the wall of the common bile duct [CBD] (+/- the common hepatic duct) and thereafter aneurysmal dilatation termed a choledochal cyst. There are five different subtypes. Patients are mostly diagnosed in childhood.  If undiagnosed to adulthood patients present with a triad of episodic jaundice, right upper quadrant pain and a right upper quadrant mass.
Type I – This is by far the most common version. The common bile duct is affected either focally or along its entire length.
Type II – A true diverticulum of the CBD
Type III – Focal dilatation of the CBD contained within the wall of the duodenum. This type is also called a choledochocoele. They present slightly later with most patients being in their 30s at the time of diagnosis and can be seen as a duodenal filling defect on barium follow-through studies.
Type IV – The intrahepatic and extrahepatic biliary ducts are affected
Type V – The intraheptic ducts are affected alone. This is termed Caroli disease however there is some discrepancy in the literature as to whether this can be called a type V choledochal cyst or whether it is a separate disease in its own right. Caroli disease (cavernous ectasia of the intrahepatic ducts) can be inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion. When present it is quite striking on imaging with saccular dilatation of most of the larger intrahepatic biliary ducts alongside focal strictures giving a beaded appearance. There is an association with medullary sponge kidney and patients are at significantly increased risk of developing cholangiocarcinoma.
  Adrenal metastasis
Secondary adrenal malignancies are more common than primary ones and the second most common adrenal lesion overall(after adenoma). The main four cancers to metastasize to the adrenal glands are four of the most prolific cancers namely: breast, colon, lung and pancreas. Of the remaining cancers, malignant melanoma can metastasize to the adrenal glands. The appearance of an adrenal metastasis varies hugely. They can be relatively low in attenuation on CT owing to a degree of central necrosis. Whereas adenomas tend to washout on multi-phase imaging, metastases often display far slower washout characteristics.
  Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma
Unfortunately pancreatic adenocarcinoma has a poor prognosis and is also reasonably common. At the time of diagnosis only 10% have surgically resectable disease and the 5 year survival rate is pitifully low at 2-3%. The classical specific presentation is with painless jaundice (Courvoisier sign – painless jaundice and a right upper quadrant mass is unlikely to be caused by gallstones) however most patients actually present with vague abdominal or right upper quadrant pains. The tumour markers usually found are CEA and Ca19-9.  Smokers, obese patients and those with a relevant oncological family history  of hormonal cancers are at increased risk of developing the cancer, as are those suffering from cancer syndrome such as HNPCC (hereditary non polyposis colorectal cancer). On ultrasound the tumour will show low reflectivity compared to any adjacent normal pancreatic tissue. On CT the masses tend to enhance poorly.
The key to management is operability. Involvement of various different local structures excludes or potentially excludes some patients from surgical management as follows:
Operable
Borderline operable
Palliative
Duodenum
Veins – IVC, SMV and Portal vein
SMA
Spleen
Arteries – aorta, splenic artery if further than 1cm from origin,
Coeliac axis
 ",FALSE,"The most likely diagnosis is adenocarcinoma, which is the most common type of pancreatic cancer.

11031,205212,A 41-year-old man complains to his GP of worsening shortness of breath and increased sputum production. He has never smoked. Abnormalities on his CXR prompt analysis with CT which shows panacinar low attenuation regions bilaterally with a lower lobe predominance. What is the most likely diagnosis?,SBA: Cardiothoracic and vascular,Alpha 1 antitrypsin deficiency,Lymphangioleiomyomatosis,Congenital lobar hyperinflation,Swyer-James syndrome,Neurofibromatosis,A,91%,3%,1%,3%,2%,"Explanation:
Alpha 1 antitrypsin deficiency
Alpha-1 antitrypsin is a glycoprotein which is made in the liver and secreted. One of its functions in the lungs is to oppose the action of proteolytic enzymes the likes of which are secreted by white blood cells in order to counter sub-clinical bacterial infections. Since A1AT is deficient in these patients the unopposed action of the enzymes goes beyond the intended destruction of pathogenic bacteria and causes damage to the lung tissue. Patients are usually diagnosed in early adulthood when their symptoms develop. On CT there is panacinar emphysema, particularly affecting the bases. Bronchiectasis is also often seen. Cirrhosis is another feature of this disease and should be looked for on imaging. 
  Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM)
LAM can go misdiagnosed for many years as emphysema. It occurs exclusively in non-smoking women of childbearing age and quite often a history of spontaneous pneumothorax is given. Radiologically there are numerous small cystic spaces surrounded by normal lung. A chylous pleural effusion (negative Hounsfield units) is reasonably specific. The main differential diagnosis would be histiocytosis which tends to be associated with smoking, classically spares the costophrenic angles and gives small nodules but both can present with spontaneous pneumothorax and give small cysts. The lung volumes in LAM will remain normal whereas they can be increased in Histiocytosis (surprisingly for a fibrotic lung disease).
  Congenital lobar overinflation (previously congenital lobar emphysema)
This condition is thought to be caused by underdevelopment of bronchial cartilage in the affected lobe(s). Consequently the bronchus is unable to remain patent during expiration leading to significant air trapping. It is usually the left upper lobe which is affected but approximately 40% of cases involve the left upper lobe; the right middle or the right upper lobes are affected in a further 55% of cases. There is a reasonable male preponderance of approximately 3:1.
On a CXR there is hyperlucency of the affected lobe and often mass effect on the mediastinum leading to contralateral mediastinal shift and thereby respiratory distress.
  Swyer-James syndrome
In this condition, normal development of the infant lung is impeded by bronchiolitis (viral or mycoplasma) at an early age, with superadded acute airspace destruction. Consequently the affected lobe is small and lucent on the CXR due to air trapping. It is a differential diagnosis for a unilateral lucent hemithorax, along with a pneumothorax, very large pulmonary emboli and causes of decreased chest wall musculature such as Poland syndrome or, historically, polio. In an an exam situation Swyer-James syndrome is usually given as a teenage or young adult patient with a history of recurrent LRTIs. Air trapping, and bronchiectasis can also be described.
  Neurofibromatosis
Technically neurofibromatosis (type I) is included in the differential diagnosis for lung cysts (particularly in the upper lobes) however the rest of the information provided is insufficient to make this the most likely answer here.",FALSE,"I chose this answer because Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) is a rare lung disease that causes panacinar low attenuation regions bilaterally with a lower lobe predominance, which is consistent with the patient's symptoms and CT results.

She requests an x-ray which shows a densely calcified mass around the elbow, although the rest of the imaged skeleton appears normal. What is the most likely diagnosis?",SBA: Paediatrics,Tumoral calcinosis,Gout,Parosteal osteosarcoma,Secondary hyperparathyroidism,Tertiary hyperparathyroidism,A,82%,8%,6%,3%,1%,"Explanation:
Tumoral calcinosis
Surprisingly for the sometimes extreme appearance of this condition, it can be completely painless. Patients are typically black and in their teens or 20s. Around a third of cases are inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion. A biochemical defect in the metabolism of phosphorus leads to accumulation of hydroxyapatite fluid around the joints causing a foreign-body type granulomatous reaction and fibrous capsule development. On imaging this appears as a progressive and calcified soft tissue mass. The skin overlying the mass can ulcerate and exude a chalky or milk like fluid. Any or all of the hips, shoulders and elbows can be affected but characteristically tumoral calcinosis does not affect the knees. Importantly the underlying bones are normal, a feature which differentiates it from gout or pseudogout.
  Gout
Excess circulating urate levels leads to crystalisation of urate (monosodium urate crystals) within the joint spaces. An acute attack may be precipitated by any acute event such as trauma or surgery as well as a change in diet to include purine containing foods (liver, kidney, game meat, some seafood, alcohol). Historically chronic manifestations of this condition included the development of gouty tophi; white lumpy areas under the skin which could ulcerate and exude a chalky material. These are still seen today but far less so thanks to improved management strategies. Involvement of the first metatarsophalangeal joint is considered classical but involvement of the carpometacarpal joints of the hands is often most debilitating where it occurs. On x-ray the earliest radiological manifestation is a joint effusion. Joint erosions develop on the lateral corners of a joint, but contrary to many other erosive processes the base of the ulcers has a sclerotic margin. Juxta-articular osteopenia is not often seen, a feature which acts as a good distinguisher from rheumatoid arthritis, which is thought to be because the attacks come in acute bursts during which time disuse osteopenia does not have the time to develop. Another reasonably specific feature of gouty arthritis is the preservation of the joint space itself until relatively late into the disease.

  Hyperparathyroidism
Parathyroid hormone acts to increase calcium levels either by promoting reabsorption in the kidneys or by acting on the osteoclasts of the bones and leads to increased bone resorption. This is seen as generalised osteopenia and cortical thinning, particularly of the subperiosteal bone.
Primary hyperparathyroidism is usually caused by an autonomous adenoma (alternatively parathyroid hyperplasia or a parathyroid carcinoma). Medullary nephrocalcinosis is most commonly caused by primary hyperparathyroidism but does also occur with secondary and tertiary hyperparathyroidism.
Secondary hyperparathyroidism is a hyperplastic response of the parathyroid glands to the high phosphate and  low calcium levels which accompany renal osteodystrophy. Soft tissue calcification is very much a feature of renal osteodystrophy. Confusingly the high circulating levels of phosphate in renal osteodystrophy leads to dystrophic mineralisation of trabecular bone which is seen as sclerosis; hence renal osteodystrophy is a cause of generalised increase in bone density despite hyperparathyroidism being a cause of osteopenia.
Tertiary hyperparathyroidism occurs when a patient with secondary hyperparathyroidism (i.e. chronic overstimulation of the parathyroid glands) goes on to develop an autonomous adenoma.
  Renal osteodystrophy
In the context of chronic renal failure there are three different mechanisms at work which give rise to a collection of different musculoskeletal manifestations. These are:
Osteomalacia or rickets
Secondary hyperparathyroidism (Brown tumours, subperiosteal bone resorption, soft tissue calcification, bony sclerosis)
Aluminium toxicity if the patient is on dialysis
Generalised increase in bone density
Renal osteodystrophy is a differential diagnosis for generalised increase in bone density and this can be the most striking finding, or indeed the only finding, for these patients. In the spine the end-plates can be particularly affected which leads to the appearance known as ‘rugger jersey spine’.
Soft tissue calcification
This most commonly affects the main organs: heart, lungs, kidneys. It can also occur around joints as fluffy cloud-like densities.
Looser zones
These are insufficiency fractures from normal stress applied to abnormal bone. They occur at 90o to the cortex and in characteristic locations such as the pubic rami, the medial aspect of the femoral neck, the lateral aspect of the scapulae, and the ribs. They are not unique to renal osteodystrophy though; they can also be found in fibrous dysplasia, Paget disease and osteogenesis imperfecta.
Brown tumours
Haemosiderin deposition from localised haemorrhage gives these lesions their name. They are osteoclastomas rather like Giant Cell Tumours which form when there is rapid bone loss in a given area due to high parathyroid hormone levels acting on osteoclasts. On plain film they appear as well defined lytic lesions which can expand the cortex but do not destroy it.
Pepperpot skull also known as salt and pepper skull
This is a feature of hyperparathyroidism and is seen when patchy resorption of trabecular bone in the skull leaves behind tiny lucencies.
Rickets
In the unfused skeleton the effects of abnormal calcium and phosphate levels manifests in many ways. There is widening of growth plates with metaphyseal cupping and fraying. Bowing of weight bearing bones is not uncommon.
  Osteosarcoma
Secondary osteosarcomas
Paget disease
Bone infarct
Osteochondroma
Osteoblastoma
Radiotherapy change
  These are bone forming tumours which can either be primary, or secondary. Primary osteosarcomas occur in young patients or young adults when the bones are more active during adolescence than in later life, and have a predilection for either the proximal tibia or distal femur i.e. around the knee joint. Secondary osteosarcomas occur as malignant degeneration of pre-existing bone lesions. Clinically they present as a painful mass with a fever. Pain on movement is also typical. In later disease patients may have a raised serum ALP. On x-ray they are poorly defined aggressive lesions with sunburst periosteal reaction and fluffy cloud-like osseous matrix. For staging the patient should receive an MRI of the entire of the affected bone (to rule out synchronous lesions), a nuclear medicine bone scan and a CT chest. Tissue biopsy should only be performed at tertiary referral centres where to mitigate the risk of seeding the biopsy tract, immediate tissue analysis with the option of immediate amputation can be performed.

Uncontrolled hypertensive attacks
  Phaeochromocytomas are known as the 10% tumours. Purportedly 10% are: bilateral, asymmetrical, familial, are extra-adrenal, contain calcification. The most well known syndromic association is with Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia (MEN) type II (both a and b). They do also occur with phakomatoses (von Hippel Lindau, neurofibromatosis type I, Sturge Weber and Tuberous Sclerosis).
The classic but rare presentation is of uncontrollable hypertension due to catecholamine production and the classic giveaway blood test is elevated levels of urinary VMA.
On CT they can have a range of appearances including post-haemorrhagic or necrotic low attenuation, solid and/or cystic areas. They enhance strongly and are slow to washout. On MRI they tend to return low T1 signal (excepting areas of haemorrhage which may be high) but very bright T2 signal giving rise to the lightbulb sign. The main differential diagnosis would be of adrenal cortical carcinoma. Pheochromocytomas don't invade the IVC and won't cause atrophy of the contralateral adrenal gland, where adrenal cortical carcinomas can. 
  MIBG scanning -(I123-Metaiodobenzylguanidine)
This comes under the broader heading of a guanethidine analogue and can be used to pinpoint catecholamine producing tumours such as pheochromocytomas or other paragangliomas. The scan can be used to locate an extra-adrenal pheochromocytoma. The tracer is also taken up by neuroblastomas, carcinoid tumours and medullary carcinoma of the thyroid.

  If the CT scan shows morphologically normal adrenal glands then an MRI scan is unlikely to be of any further benefit. A dedicated MRI scan of the adrenal glands with in and out of phase sequences might be useful in the setting of an indeterminate mass; if there is signal dropout within the mass it is likely to be an adenoma.
An adrenal biopsy should 'never' be performed for a suspected pheochromocytoma. The risk is of provoking catecholamine release and triggering extreme hypertension or a cardiac arrhythmia.
  Adrenal adenoma
These present a diagnostic challenge if only to rule out a malignant adrenal mass. Once the diagnosis is confirmed they can then be left alone and do not require any further imaging. The majority are obvious on CT and obviously adenomas. Owing to their high fat content most adenomas show low Hounsfield units (HU) and HU <18 on an unenhanced study has a sensitivity of 85% and a specificity of 100%.
In cases where the fat content is insufficient to make the diagnosis an adrenal protocol CT can be performed. This compares the HU on an unenhanced scan, a portal venous phase scan and a 15 minute delayed phase scan. From these values the absolute washout can be calculated by comparing the difference between the two contrast studies with the amount of contrast taken up in the first place (i.e. the difference between the portal venous phase and the unenhanced phase). The relative washout is calculated by comparing the difference between the two contrast studies to just the portal venous phase (i.e. it is relative to the portal venous phase).
An alternative diagnostic strategy which, but for demand management, is better for patients as far as dose preservation is concerned, is an MRI scan. The fat content of adrenal adenomas shows up well as signal loss on out-of-phase imaging and gives a chemical shift artefact in the frequency encoding direction on both gradient echo and spin echo sequences.  On gradient echo sequences due to the chemical shift a black line appears in all directions and is termed the India Ink effect or etching artefact.

  Adrenal metastasis
This is an important differential diagnosis for a malignant lesion of the adrenal gland. Lung cancer is the most obvious culprit but other cancers do also metastasize to the adrenal glands (Breast, Colorectal, Renal cell, Malignant melanoma, Pancreas). Metastases take on a variety of appearances depending on their cell type but usually retain contrast for longer than adenomas leading to low washout figures. Owing to their neoplastic nature they are however, usually reasonably vascular and therefore show strong enhancement in the portal venous phase (>100HU). On an MRI scan they enhance with gadolinium but importantly fail to show any signal loss on fat suppression sequences.
  Adrenal cortical carcinoma
These present either as large incidental masses or, in around half of cases, secrete hormones and are found during investigations for their effects. Cushing syndrome, Conn syndrome or virulisation are the predominant consequences. They present in adulthood, often around the age of 50 and can be quite large by the time they are diagnosed, although those that produce hormones are often picked up earlier and consequently do not reach the impressive sizes seen with their more inert counterparts. Bizarrely they are seen in association with astrocytomas and less bizarrely they can occur as part of Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia (MEN). On CT they will be seen as a suprarenal heterogeneous mass with modular peripheral enhancement. Areas of low attention are seen when necrosis has occurred and calcification can sometimes be seen. Where calcification is present in a suprarenal mass it is a strong indicator of malignancy. Adrenal washout is used more for the detection of phaeochromocytomas and proving the benignity of adenomas but adrenal cortical carcinomas do retain contrast leading to low washout percentages - a relative washout of <40% would be expected. Scans must be scrutinised for evidence of invasion of the IVC, diaphragm or kidney.
MRI findings are not all too dissimilar to CT namely heterogeneity with limited contrast washout. They are usually hyper-intense on both T1 and T2 when compared to the liver.

13942,205212,You are performing an ultrasound scan on a 60-year-old woman and notice a liver lesion. You suggest characterisation with MRI as your hospital does not offer contrast-enhanced ultrasound. On the MRI scan the liver is small and irregular in outline but the lesion is slightly higher in intensity than the rest of the liver on the T2 weighted sequences. There is strong arterial enhancement with Primovist but on the hepatobiliary phase sequences the lesion returns little signal. What is the most likely diagnosis?,SBA: Gastrointestinal,Hepatocellular carcinoma,Focal Nodular Hyperplasia,Haemangioma,Hepatic abscess,Focal fatty infiltration,A,77%,10%,11%,1%,1%,"Explanation:
Gadoxetic acid disodium (Primovist) and gadobentate disodium (MultiHance) are hepatobiliary specific MRI contrast agents. They are taken up by hepatocytes.
The hepatobiliary phase is taken at approximately 20mins following contrast injection. At this point, with Primovist, only normal hepatocytes (and FNHs) should retain the contrast. Malignant lesions such as HCC will have washed-out.
  Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)
Although metastases are the most common cause of malignant hepatic lesions, hepatocellular carcinoma is the most common primary hepatic malignancy. It usually arises on a background of cirrhosis of any cause. Patients with any of the hepatitis viruses, alcoholic cirrhosis, haemochromatosis, and Wilson disease are all at risk. Carcinogens such as thorotrast and aflatoxin also predispose to HCC formation. Serum alpha fetoprotein levels are often raised, in contrast with cholangiocarcinomas which are one of the main differential diagnoses.
On imaging HCCs can have a variety of appearances. A large irregular mass with satellite nodules is the most common finding but a diffuse infiltrative version can also occur. Since HCCs derive their blood supply from the hepatic artery they show arterial enhancement on CT with washout on later phases. On ultrasound HCCs tend to be hypoechoic when compared to the rest of the liver and on MRI they show variable signal intensity on both T1 and T2 but arterial enhancement with venous washout can again be seen once Gadolinium has been given. Usually they return slightly higher signal on T2 than the remainder of the liver.
Fibrolamellar carcinoma of the liver is a specific subtype which occurs in slightly younger patients with otherwise normal livers. It is an echogenic lobulated mass on ultrasound with a central fibrous scar which does not enhance on CT. The lack of enhancement, and sometimes presence of calcification, within the scar separates it from fibrous nodular hyperplasia which is the main differential diagnosis. On MRI the scar returns low signal on T1 and T2 owing to its fibrous nature.
Thorotrast is a carcinogenic historic contrast agent used in the 30s and 40s. Its use was abruptly curtailed once it was realised that it is retained indefinitely in the reticuloendothelial system. It causes hepatocellular carcinomas and cholangiocarcinomas, but hepatic angiosarcomas are the most frequently quoted related malignancies.
  Haemangioma
Cavernous hepatic haemangiomas are the most common solid benign liver lesions and the second most common liver lesion overall (after secondary tumours). Pathologically they are composed of large vascular channels in which the blood flows very slowly. They are usually supplied by the hepatic artery which goes some way to explaining their enhancement characteristics. With all contrast studies three different types of enhancement can be seen.
Flash haemangiomas – these show immediate and uniform enhancement which persists on delayed sequences (unlike hypervascular tumours which wash out)
Peripheral nodular enhancement on arterial imaging with complete filling in on delayed images
Peripheral nodular enhancement with incomplete filling in – this usually occurs in giant (>5cm diameter) haemangiomas where the central portion is thrombosed.
  On ultrasound they are usually well-defined hyperechoic compared to normal liver parenchyma. Contrast enhanced ultrasound is coming to the forefront of diagnosis for solitary hepatic lesions, relieving some of the burden of MRI. Haemangiomas show either flash filling or peripheral nodular increased reflectivity followed by a gradual total or near total filling in when microbubble contrast is given.
On MRI the slow flowing blood causes very high signal on T2 weighted images, higher than the spleen and high enough to cause T2 shine through on diffusion weighted images. Conversely although metastases will also show high T2 signal they do not usually outshine the spleen in this regard. Similarly to contrast enhanced ultrasound findings for a haemangioma, the pattern of gradual filling in is replicated with gadolinium-based contrast agents on an MRI scan although on the delayed phase of a hepatobiliary specific contrast agent the lesion will be low in signal as haemangiomas do not contain normal hepatocytes.
Nuclear medicine studies can be useful in the diagnosis of heamangiomata. Sulphur colloid studies will show a photopenic area initially which 1-2hours later shows increased uptake.
  Focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH)
These lesions typically occur in women in late middle age. They are not caused by oral contraceptive use however they do enlarge in response to hormone stimulation. They are composed of hyperplastic hepatocytes and are thought to arise when a small underlying congenital vascular malformation means that an area of the liver receives a better blood supply and therefore grows better, thus they lack a true capsule but can outgrow their blood supply resulting in the classical central fibrous scar which is present in around half of cases. On imaging they do demonstrate mass effect, displacing adjacent vessels, have marked arterial enhancement which fits in with their supposed aetiology. The central scar enhances only on delayed sequences. On MRI they tend to return high signal on T2 weighted sequences. Their appearance on contrast enhanced ultrasound is interesting; the central scar enhances very early in the arterial phase, branching out in a spoke-wheel type of appearance. During the main arterial phase the lesions enhance strongly before becoming isoechoic in the portal venous phase. On the delayed hepatobiliary phases the lesions are shown to have retained contrast while the adjacent normal liver parenchyma will gradually wash out.  They are the only hepatic lesions to do this.

    Hepatic Adenoma
These benign masses are caused by hormone use (including anabolic steroid use) although they can arise without such exposure. They are composed of hepatocytes without portal tract or bile ducts. Kupffer cells are also absent meaning they do not take up hepotocyte-specific MRI agents such as Primovist. Like FNH they can have a central scar but unlike FNH they have a fibrous pseudocapsule seen on ultrasound as a hypoechoic rim surrounding the otherwise (usually but not always) hyperechoic mass. They have a tendency to outgrow their blood supply which can result in spontaneous haemorrhage (this is often the presenting feature). CT is useful in this regard, as an acute imaging technique however adenomas show arterial enhancement much like FNH making the diagnosis difficult. MRI using Primovist is therefore more useful. On the unenhanced images adenomas are isointense to the rest of the liver on T1, and loses signal on out of phase images much like FNH however adenomas do not enhance with Primovist where FNHs do.
  Focal steatosis also known as focal fatty infiltration
The liver plays a small role in fat storage and subtle variation in blood supply and drainage between different areas can lead to variations in the amount of fat in those areas. Focal fatty change is very common and has a geographic appearance on all imaging modalities, with a lack of mass effect (ie preservation of the vascular architecture). It can occur anywhere within the liver but is classically found adjacent to the falciform ligament (i.e. segments II, III and IV). Fat-identifying sequences on MRI can be very useful to cinch the diagnosis with signal drop out on out-of-phase images. Focal fatty sparing on the other hand appears as the inverse of this and on CT will be seen as isoattenuation on a background of a diffusely hypoattenuating liver. On ultrasound the liver will be diffusely hyperechoic when compared to the right kidney, and the spared area will be hypoechoic.
  Hepatic abscess
Liver abscesses can occur in children, for much the same reasons as they arise in adults, although they are far more common in adults. In neonates they may arise as a complication from a misplaced umbilical venous catheter. Pyogenic abscesses result from bacteria accessing the liver via the biliary tree, septicaemia, direct spread, trauma or during a liver procedure. Adult patients are usually in their 60s. Amoebic abscesses occur in slightly younger patients (40s) and tend to result from spread of amoebae from the colon via the portal venous system. On ultrasound abscesses appear as a hypoechoic mass with posterior acoustic enhancement. Internal debris may be apparent. On CT they are usually low in attenuation and may have a rim of enhancing tissue depending on the phase of the contrast. MRI signal characteristics are dependent on the protein content of the pus but usually abscesses return little T1 signal and, owing to their fluid nature, return high signal on T2 weighted sequences. It is said that amoebic abscesses are usually found to be contiguous with the liver capsule.
 ",TRUE,"The most likely diagnosis of a liver lesion with slightly higher intensity than the rest of the liver on T2 weighted sequences, strong arterial enhancement with Primovist, and little signal on the hepatobiliary phase sequences is hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).

He makes a good recovery initially but three months later is still experiencing symptoms at the site of bruising and he undergoes an x-ray. The x-ray points to a diagnosis of myositis ossificans which is subsequently confirmed with CT. Which of the following patterns of calcification would be most specific for myositis ossificans?,SBA: Musculoskeletal and Trauma,Well-defined mass with marginal calcification,Poorly defined mass with central calcification,Well-defined mass with central calcification,Poorly defined mass with marginal calcification,Poorly defined mass with diffuse calcification,A,56%,5%,10%,17%,13%,"Explanation:
Myositis ossificans
Trauma to the muscle causes local haemorrhage and necrosis of damaged muscle. The sequelae of this is calcification which can persist long-term. Large muscles are particularly prone to this and the typical patient is a young, active adolescent. Myositis ossificans appears as a calcified soft tissue mass underlying the area of clinical concern. A periosteal reaction may or may not be present but crucially there is no erosion of the underlying cortex, a fact which discriminates it from malignant fibrous histiocytoma. The string sign refers to the presence of a plane of normal tissue separating the mass from the bone and unlike a parosteal osteosarcoma, in myositis ossificans this plane will extend along the whole length of the mass completely separating it from the bone.
Myositis ossificans has different appearances at different time-frames post-injury. It begins as amorphous calcification and then develops a sharper cortical margin after approximately 2 months. Classically it further calcifies occurs from the outer rim inwards. This is significant as it is in contrast to a parosteal osteosarcoma which demonstrates central calcification and peripheral lucency.",FALSE,Myositis ossificans is a condition in which a mass of bone forms in a muscle due to trauma or inflammation. The most specific pattern of calcification for this condition is a well-defined mass with central calcification. This means that the mass has a clearly defined border and the calcification is concentrated in the center of the mass. This pattern of calcification is seen in myositis ossificans and can help differentiate it from other conditions that can cause similar symptoms.,1,"3.

The uterine cavity outlines normally but you notice irregularity and multiple diverticuli of the fallopian tubes bilaterally. There is no spill. What is the most likely diagnosis?,"SBA: Genito urinary, Adrenal, Obstetrics & Gynaecology and Breast",Salpingitis isthmica nodosa,Pelvic inflammatory disease,Actinomycosis,Tuberculosis,Asherman syndrome,A,85%,6%,2%,3%,4%,"Explanation:
Salpingitis isthmica nodosa 
The aetiology of this condition is debatable but has been linked with previous pelvic inflammatory disease. There is a strong association with infertility and, where pregnancy does arise, with ectopic implantation. Nodular thickening affects the fallopian tube, with particular prevalence in the proximal two thirds. This leads to a classical appearance on HSG of multiple tiny diverticuli, with no spill of contrast distally. 
  Asherman syndrome
Historically this condition was the result of infection with tuberculosis but nowadays it is more often the consequence of iatrogenic endometrial damage. The formation of intrauterine synechiae leads to subfertility and these fibrous bands can be seen on HSG as filling defects and surface irregularity. 
  Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID)
This is a coverall term applied to ascending infection of the genital tract. It encompasses endometritis, salpingitis, hydrosalpinx, pyosalpinx, and tubo-ovarian abscesses. Chlamydia and gonorrhoea account of most of the cases and the disease is most prevalent in sexually active young people. Imaging features are those secondary to inflammation with increased vascularity to the endometrium and small volume ascites. Inflammation is also seen on MRI as avid enhancement post contrast. Pelvic inflammatory disease can be complicated by a condition called Fitz-Hugh-Curtis syndrome where there is perihepatitis secondary to PID. 
  Tuberculous pelvic inflammatory disease
TB tends to affect the Fallopian tubes, causing many separate strictured points which causes a beaded appearance on HSG.  On CT the presence of calcified pelvic lymph nodes may point at the diagnosis.
  Actinomycosis
Various species of actinomyces reside within the gastrointestinal and genitourinary tracts without causing any problems however opportunistic infections can occur when there is a breach to the mucosa. Thus pelvic actinomycosis tends to be consequent from events such as IUCD placement, surgery or trauma. Broadly speaking the imaging features will be those of pelvic inflammatory disease with pelvic fat stranding on CT, intraperitoneal free fluid and possible tubo-ovarian abscess formation. The density of any free fluid is pertinent only insofar pointing towards an infective cause go. Other causes of increased free fluid density would be haemorrhage or a high protein content.",TRUE,"Salpingitis isthmica nodosa (SIN) is a condition characterized by the presence of multiple nodular lesions in the fallopian tube, which can lead to infertility. The nodules are caused by inflammation of the mucosa and can be seen on hysterosalpingogram (HSG) as irregularity and multiple diverticuli of the fallopian tubes bilaterally. The lack of spill on the HSG is also a typical finding in SIN. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis in this case is Salpingitis isthmica nodosa.",2,,A,FALSE,,B,TRUE,A

Idiopathic eosinophilic oesophagitis
History of atopy usually present
Specific ring-like indentations to the oesophagus
  Glycogen acanthosis
This condition is caused by benign age-related squamous hyperplasia but, based on its imaging features, a differential diagnosis for candidiasis. On a barium swallow there will be small rounded white plaques in a random distribution, predominantly affecting the middle and upper oesophagus. Patients are typically middle aged or elderly.
  Intramural pseudodiverticulosis
This is a feature of candidal oesophagitis. Tiny diverticulae are found scattered along the length of the oesophagus and on a barium swallow the appearance can be quite impressive!

Which SINGLE statement regarding the ligaments of the ankle is true?,SBA: Musculoskeletal and Trauma,The anterior talofibular ligament inserts into the lateral aspect of the talus,The deltoid ligament inserts into the base of the 1st metacarpal,The deltoid ligament is thinner than the lateral collateral ligament,The posterior talofibular ligament resists over-eversion of the foot,The deltoid ligament arises from the lateral malleolus,A,64%,10%,4%,13%,9%,"Explanation:
The ankle has two sets of ligaments, which originate from each malleolus:
1. The medial (deltoid) ligament:
This is a multi-banded ligament that lies on the medial side of the ankle. It attaches proximally to the medial malleolus. It consists of four separate ligaments that fan out distally to attach to the talus, calcaneus and navicular. Its primary action is to resist over-eversion of the foot.
2. The lateral ligament:
The lateral collateral ligament is made up of three individual bands that all arise from the lateral malleolus. It resists over-inversion of the foot. The insertions of the three ligaments are as follows:
The anterior talofibular ligament: lateral aspect of the talus
The posterior talofibular ligament: posterior aspect of the talus
The calcaneofibular ligament: calcaneus
  The medial collateral (deltoid) ligament is much thicker and stronger than the lateral collateral ligament and less commonly injured.
Gravity stress radiographs assess the integrity of the deltoid ligament in lateral malleolar ankle fractures without talar shift.
 ",FALSE,"I chose this answer because it is the only statement that accurately describes the ligaments of the ankle.

There is a differential diagnosis for lytic lesions of the skull.
  Parietal foramina
This is a benign congenital condition where the parietal bones fail to completely ossify leading to paired defects in the characteristic para-sagittal location. There are usually no clinical consequences.
  Eosinophilic granuloma causes round punched-out type lesions, usually described as having a bevelled edge. These would usually be solitary although multiple lesions are definitely possible. The symmetry of the lesions described in the question goes against this on grounds of probability though.
  Fibrous dysplasia can affect the skull. It is usually described as having a ground glass appearance with cortical expansion and a swell-defined sclerotic margin.
  Osteogenesis imperfecta is not usually part of the differential diagnosis for lytic lesions in the skull. Multiple wormian bones are part of the diagnostic criteria and at a stretch leptomeningeal cysts caused by skull fractures due to fragility could be brought into the picture.
  Sinus pericranii is largely a soft tissue (vascular) mass which can cause secondary effects on the skull, including a localised defect. Again though, bilateral symmetrical defects would be unusual.",TRUE,"Parietal foramina are the most likely diagnosis because they are symmetrical, well-circumscribed lucencies seen posteriorly in the skull vault.

What is the most likely diagnosis?,SBA: Central Nervous and Head & Neck,Cavernoma,Malignant melanoma metastasis,Renal cell carcinoma metastasis,Cerebral amyloid angiopathy,Diffuse axonal injury,A,83%,6%,4%,6%,1%,"Explanation:
The classical feature of a cavernoma (aka cavernous haemangioma) on MRI is the ‘popcorn’ appearance caused by a bright lobulated centre surrounded by a rim of hypointensity. Haemosiderin deposition causes the blooming artefact on susceptibility weighted sequences. It is perhaps slightly counterintuitive that there can be no enhancement on post-contrast CT scans, given the vascular nature of these lesions, however when we consider that flow within the lesion may be very slow then this makes a little more sense. Another important distinguishing feature from other lesions is the fact that, unlike metastases, there is no mass effect or oedema from these lesions, despite the fact that they can often present with seizures.
Cerebral amyloid angiopathy gives rise to micro-haemorrhages at the grey-white matter junction which are well seen as blooming artefact on susceptibility weighted sequences.",TRUE,"I chose this answer because a cavernoma is the most likely diagnosis based on the imaging findings. A cavernoma is a vascular malformation composed of dilated, thin-walled blood vessels that often present as a hyperdense lesion on CT and a heterogenous T1 signal with a hypointense rim on T2 and susceptibility on T2* on MRI.

14204,205212,A 12-year-old boy undergoes a contrast enhanced CT scan for further investigation of an anterior mediastinal mass which was found on a chest radiograph.

Select ONE answer only.,SBA: Paediatrics,Lymphoma,Tuberculosis,Teratoma,Seminoma,Askin tumour,A,75%,3%,10%,6%,6%,"Explanation:
Lymphoma
This is the most common anterior mediastinal mass in children. It may be difficult to differentiate a lymphoma from normal thymus, particularly in a patient younger than 10 years of age. Associated lymphadenopathy (i.e. cervical) can be the key to distinguishing the two pathologies. Calcification is rare prior to any treatment but can be a feature of lymphoma which has been treated.
  Renal lymphoma
Renal lymphoma may be seen as an incidental finding or in the context of a pre-existing non-Hodgkin lymphoma study. Involvement of the kidneys can be either via haematogenous spread or direct extension from retroperitoneal lymph nodes. The appearances on CT tend to fall into one of a few different categories despite there being little difference in the type of lymphoma.
By far the most common pattern is that of multiple bilateral masses. The masses tend to enhance poorly with contrast and are therefore seen as low attenuation against the normal renal parenchyma.
A large solitary mass mimicking a renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is another type of renal lymphoma presentation. These will usually be more homogenous in appearance than an RCC although there is much overlap in appearances of the two.
Contiguous retroperitoneal extension can appear quite drastic on a CT scan. Often associated with bulky lymph nodes in the retroperitoneum there is a homogeneous soft-tissue mass encasing the renal vessels which can usually still be seen running through the mass even when it is significantly large.
Perirenal disease is odd in so far as it can leave the renal parenchyma itself relatively unharmed. It appears as low attenuation surrounding the kidney at may at first casual glance, be mistaken for a urinoma.
Infiltrative disease can be a subtle finding when there is bilateral renal enlargement. The key finding is that although enlarged, the kidneys retain their ‘reniform’ shape. Infiltrative lymphoma is the most likely of the above to cause a decline in renal function. Usually kidneys infiltrated with lymphoma would appear hypoechoic, not echogenic.
  Germ Cell Tumour
This often causes a large anterior mediastinal mass. It can be subdivided into Teratoma (usually cystic with fat and calcification), seminoma (bulky and lobulated) and Non-seminomatous Germ Cell Tumour (haemorrhage and necrosis).
  Askin Tumour
These heterogenous tumours are part of the Ewing Sarcoma spectrum. Patients are often in their early teens. Askin tumours displace rather than invade adjacent mediastinal structures although rib destruction is common and is a fact which can help distinguish it from a pleuropulmonary blastoma which is another cause of a large mediastinal mass, albeit usually found in babies under the age of 2, but which does not cause rib destruction.",FALSE,"Seminomas are a type of germ cell tumor that usually occur in the testicles, but they can also occur in the mediastinum. The CT scan would likely show bilateral low density renal lesions, which is a common finding in seminomas.",2,,D,TRUE,,A,FALSE,B

Arterial bleeding from pelvic fractures
Pelvic fractures in the context of trauma are a cause of significant morbidity and mortality. Life threatening haemorrhage may be caused by arterial bleeding or other sources such as the fractured bones themselves, and the pelvic venous structures. External fixation is one of the few means of managing acute haemorrhage in the pre-hospital setting however for arterial bleeding it is far less effective at tamponading ongoing haemorrhage. It remains the treatment of choice for bone bleeding or venous bleeding.
Catheter angiography and embolisation is the most effective method to control arterial haemorrhage. If the patient is haemodynamically unstable due to an arterial pelvic haemorrhage, catheter embolisation still provides the best hope for managing the patient successfully. Even if the patient has abdominal injuries which are likely to necessitate open abdominal trauma surgery, studies have shown that arterial pelvic bleeding should still be controlled via catheter embolisation prior to their open surgery.",TRUE,"Angiography and embolisation is the best option for managing this type of pelvic fracture with active haemorrhage from an internal iliac artery branch.

11771,205212,On the ward round of the neonatal intensive care unit a baby is reviewed. She was born four weeks ago at 31+4 weeks gestation. She has been receiving mechanical ventilation but her CXRs have been gradually worsening. The latest one shows hyperinflation of both lungs with coarse linear lucencies. Focal areas of emphysema can also be seen. There are no pleural effusions. What is the most likely diagnosis?,SBA: Paediatrics,Bronchopulmonary dysplasia,Transient tachypnoea of the newborn,Meconium aspiration,Pulmonary interstitial emphysema,Hyaline membrane disease,A,48%,1%,2%,45%,5%,"Explanation:
This question comes down to either BPD or PIE as both can occur in neonates and the radiological features overlap. It would therefore perhaps be unfair to be asked to choose between them in the real exam. The timing fits BPD well and as a general rule, the clinical deterioration from BPD is more gradual; with PIE it is more sudden. On this basis, the correct answer for this question should be given as BPD.
----------------------
Of the five main respiratory conditions of the neonate the differential diagnosis can be narrowed based on gestational age. The presence of hyperinflation can also be useful but may not always be present where feasible so should not be used as an absolute discriminator. If present, it is useful.
    Meconium aspiration
Meconium is sticky and causes a chemical pneumonitis in the lungs, seen as patchy consolidation. In addition small globules of meconium entering bronchi and bronchioles of a decreasing calibre act as a ball-valve mechanism and lead to air trapping; thus the lung volumes of a baby with meconium aspiration may be increased. Air bronchograms are notably absent. The typical baby in a meconium aspiration situation is post-term.
  Transient tachypnoea of the newborn (TTN)
The classical patient for TTN would be a term baby born by caesarean section to a diabetic mother. During normal vaginal delivery the compression of the baby as it descends the birth canal acts to squeeze fluid out from its lungs. This mechanism is all but absent during a caesarean section. Consequently these babies are born with an excess of retained fluid. The CXR of an affected baby will show bilateral symmetrical air space opacification with air bronchograms, fluid in the fissures and pleural effusions. This peaks in severity at 24hrs but resolves by three days.
  Hyaline Membrane Disease (HMD) also known as surfactant deficient disease (SDD)
It is to reduce the likelihood of this disease developing that a woman in pre-term labour will be offered a steroid injection. The steroids help the neonatal lungs to develop faster and increase the likelihood of their being able to produce surfactant once delivered. Where there is surfactant deficiency the alveoli collapse. The CXR will show a granular opacification throughout both lungs which progresses to bilateral ground glass opacification with air bronchograms. If exogenous surfactant is given to the baby there may be asymmetrical improvement in the appearances depending on how much reaches each lung. Of note HMD does not cause pleural effusions. Finally a normal CXR at 6hrs post delivery excludes HMD.
  Pulmonary interstitial emphysema (PIE)
As the name would suggest, this disease is diagnosed when there is air within the interstitial tissues of the lungs. It is caused by alveolar rupture due to the barotrauma of mechanical ventilation or positive airway pressure. It can be associated with hyaline membrane disease and is prevalent in infants of a low birth weight. Complications such as pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum can be severe and acutely life threatening. Radiographically there is hyperinflation and lucencies in either a cystic pattern or streaks emanating from the hila and following the direction of the bronchi/bronchioles. It is treated with high frequency oscillation ventilation which is less traumatic to the lungs.
  Bronchopulmonary dysplasia
This also occurs due to barotrauma in ventilated neonates but is a more gradual process, occurring later on in the baby’s life. Typically (but not exclusively) the baby is premature (hence requiring ventilation). It only usually occurs after the baby in question has received ventilation of >21% oxygen for longer than 28 days. The lungs are hyperinflated and what starts off as ground glass opacification becomes complete opacification with air bronchograms in a few days. After 30 days it can be seen as coarse linear lucencies, described as radiating from the hila, with focal emphysematous change. Mikity syndrome has similar features but occurs in term infants who have not received mechanical assistance.",TRUE,Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is the most likely diagnosis for this baby. BPD is a chronic lung disease that can develop in preterm infants due to the effects of mechanical ventilation and other treatments used in the neonatal intensive care unit. The CXR findings of hyperinflation of both lungs with coarse linear lucencies and focal areas of emphysema are consistent with BPD. The absence of pleural effusions is also consistent with BPD.,2,,A,FALSE,,D,FALSE,E

The Lauge-Hansen classification is a lesser used, but highly useful classification for ankle fractures. It describes the mechanics of the injury in better detail than the Weber classification.
  Pronation-external rotation
Transverse medial malleolus fracture (or deltoid disruption) and spiral fibula fracture.

Subacute combined degeneration
This is a curious condition which can be subtle to detect. A deficiency of vitamin B12 (usually caused by malabsorption) leads to degeneration within the dorsal columns of the cord. The dorsal columns carry nerves responsible for position and vibration sense and as such patients present with loss of these senses as well as sensory ataxia (balance significantly deteriorates when the patients’ eyes are shut thereby excluding visual stabilisation as opposed to sensory stabilisation), and hyperreflexia.
On an MRI scan there will be (if the resolution allows), a longitudinal line of high T2 signal within the cord on sagittal sequences, and often a characteristic 'inverted-V' shape of high T2 signal on axial sequences. In some cases, the 'V' is clearly seen and in others it is harder to appreciate and the finding is more of high T2 signal bilaterally and symmetrically in the region of the posterior columns.

The vascular supply to the spinal cord is derived largely from the vertebral arteries or intercostal arteries with one longitudinal running anterior spinal cord artery and two small longitudinally running posterior spinal cord arteries.
The artery of Adamkiewicz is a particularly large segmental artery supplying the anterior spinal artery from around the level of T9. It is responsible for most of the spinal cord blood supply for the lumbar spinal cord. Damage during aortic surgery or trauma can result in spinal cord infarction.
Usually any vascular insult results in a reasonably rapid onset of symptoms. Spinal cord infarctions are no exception. Often more than one vertebral level is affected.
An MRI will show T2 hyperintensity of at least the central grey matter (if not the whole cross-section of the cord) due to oedema. As with intracranial infarctions there will be restriction of diffusion on the DWI sequences.
Particularly in the thoracic spine, the adjacent vertebral body may also lose its blood supply and undergo infarction.
 ",TRUE,"The inverted-V shape of high T2 signal in the posterior columns is highly suggestive of subacute combined degeneration of the cord. This is because the high T2 signal is indicative of an inflammatory process, which is a hallmark of this condition. The high T2 signal is typically seen in the posterior columns of the spinal cord, and it is usually in the shape of an inverted-V. This is because the inflammation affects the posterior columns first, then spreads outward from there.",2,,D,TRUE,,A,FALSE,C

Takayasu arteritis
This is a large vessel vasculitis which can in extreme cases cause aortic occlusion. The renal arteries are commonly involved and the result is hypertension.

13964,205212,A 73-year-old lady is seen in a neurology clinic and undergoes an MRI scan of her brain as well as a nuclear medicine study. There is global cerebral atrophy and on the T2 weighted sequences there is blurring of the pars compacta in the midbrain. The nuclear medicine study shows reduced uptake in the posterior putamina bilaterally. What is the most likely diagnosis? Select ONE answer only.,SBA: Central Nervous and Head & Neck,Parkinson's disease,Alzheimer's disease,Pick's disease,Huntington's disease,Lewy body dementia,A,74%,6%,3%,8%,9%,"Explanation:
Parkinson's disease
Generalised cerebral atrophy occurs with Parkinson's disease but is a highly non-specific feature. There are, however, radiological findings in the midbrain which although subtle, are far more specific. Parkinson's disease occurs when there is neuronal loss in the substantia nigra, specifically the pars compacta of the substantia nigra. On a T2 weighted MRI image this appears as blurring of the intermediate signal intensity line which separates the two adjacent low intensity structures (these are the pars reticulata of the substantia nigra and the red nucleus).
A DAT scan (Dopamine Active Transfer) can be performed to confirm the diagnosis. This uses the radiopharmaceutical I-123 Ioflupane to image dopamine transporters in the brain. These are present in the highest concentrations in the putamina and caudate nuclei. In patients with true Parkinson's disease (as opposed to other similar conditions), there will be loss of uptake in the posterior putamen. This can be an asymmetric finding. Colloquially speaking the appearance of these areas on a normal patient resembles a comma and on a patient with Parkinson's disease they become more like full stops.

    There are two anatomical areas of the brain which are particular important in the field of neurodegenerative nuclear medicine.
The cingulate gyrus - next to the corpus callosum
The precuneus - between the cingulate sulcus and the parieto-occipital sulcus
  Image © Medical Exam Prep
  Pick's disease is also called frontotemporal dementia
As the name would suggest, the main abnormalities are seen in the frontal and temporal lobes, including the anterior part of the cingulate gyrus. These areas show low metabolism on PET studies. The posterior part of the cingulate gyrus and the precuneus are spared.
  Lewy body dementia
A core clinical feature to this dementia is the fluctuant nature of the symptoms. Parkinsonian features can also develop although these are usually subsequent to the memory decline. Visual hallucinations are also a feature.  Radiologically there is a generalised decrease in cerebral volume (sparing the hippocampi). Temporo-parietal hypoperfusion on HMPAO Tc99m SPECT scanning is indicative of Lewy body dementia. Involvement of the occipital cortex, which is typically spared in Alzheimers disease, sets the two apart from one another on PET studies. The cingulate island sign has also been ascribed to Lewy body dementia, where there is preservation of metabolism in the  mid-posterior cingulate gyrus. If present, this is said to be specific for Lewy body dementia.
  Alzheimer's disease
Neuronal loss with Alzheimer's disease occurs first in the mesial temporal lobe which can be seen as cerebral volume loss there on an MRI scan. To assess this region the scan should be viewed on a coronal sequence through the level of the pons, where the hippocampi can be seen clearly. Although medial temporal lobe atrophy is not remotely specific for Alzheimer's disease, it is almost always present. Early changes in metabolism can be seen in the posterior part of the cingulate gyrus and the precuneus on PET studies, as well as in the posterior temporal and parietal lobes. Classically there is sparing of specific areas such as the anterior cingulate gyrus the basal ganglia, and the occipital lobes.
  Huntington’s disease
There are relatively few radiological manifestations of Huntington disease. The usual one described is atrophy of the heads of the caudate nuclei with consequential prominence of the adjacent lateral ventricle frontal horns with a ‘box’ like appearance. Various studies have been done to quantify the extent of this atrophy. On functional studies there can be low activity in the caudate nucleus head and putamen.",TRUE,"I chose this answer because Parkinson's disease is one of the most common causes of global cerebral atrophy, which is the condition seen on the MRI scan.

13740,205212,A 55-year-old man with symptoms of breathlessness and palpitations is being investigated. He is found to be in AF. On examination he has a mid-diastolic murmur with presystolic accentuation. ECHO shows a solid pericardial mass. On MRI it is hyperintense to the myocardium on T1 and T2. What is the most likely diagnosis?,SBA: Cardiothoracic and vascular,Cardiac metastasis,Atrial myxoma,Atrial thrombus,Cardiac sarcoma,Papillary fibroelastoma,A,61%,16%,8%,8%,7%,"Explanation:
High T1 signal can be caused by:
Melanin, protein, contrast agents, fat, methaemaglobin (subacute haemorrhage).
  Cardiac metastases
Metastases are significantly more common than cardiac sarcomas, meaning metastases are the most common malignant cardiac tumours. In contrast to myxomas or fibroelastomas, malignant lesions tend to have a broad attachment to the heart wall. Tumours can be from lung or breast cancer, lymphoma, leukaemia and malignant melanoma.
Although malignant melanoma most commonly metastasizes to the lungs, liver, brain and skeleton and is rarely found in the heart, of cardiac metastases at all it is by far the most common.
  Atrial myxoma
These are the most common benign neoplasms of the heart. Although usually sporadic, they can occur as part of Carney complex (atrial myxoma, facial/buccal pigmentation, sertoli tumours of the testis and multiple other findings. Not to be confused with Carney triad - pulmonary chondromas, gastric leiomyosarcomas and extra-adrenal paragangliomas). The finding of a small mass attached to the interatrial septum by a stalk is classical. Their mobility allows some to prolapse through the relevant atrioventricular valve during the cardiac cycle. They can act as a focus for platelet aggregation leading to systemic emboli for the more common left sided masses or pulmonary emboli for right sided myxomas. Iso or hypointentisty on T1w MRI is typical.
  Carney Triad Carney Complex
1. Pulmonary chondromas Atrial myxoma
2. Gastric leiomyosarcoma Facial/ buccal pigmentation
3. Extra-adrenal paraganglioma Sertoli tumour of the testis
  Pituitary adenoma
  Papillary fibroelastoma
These tumours are rare even for cardiac tumours but yet are the most common cardiac tumour to be associated with the valves. Rather counter-intuitively, they do not cause valvular dysfunction. They are, like myxomas, relatively mobile, attached by a stalk, and able to prolapse through a valve but where myxomas usually arise from the interatrial septum, papillary fibroelastomas grow from the valve itself. Histopathologically they are gelatinous tumours resembling sea anemones with multiple papillary projections. They can act as a focus for platelet aggregation leading to systemic emboli for left sided masses or pulmonary emboli for right-sided masses.
  Cardiac sarcoma
There are many different types of cardiac sarcoma. Cardiac sarcomas are the most common cause of primary malignant cardiac tumours. Their presentation usually relates either to embolic phenomena such as TIAs or symptoms from invasion such as pericardial effusion. In contrast to myxomas or fibroelastomas, malignant lesions tend to have a broad attachment to the heart wall. Another useful differentiating feature on imaging is the involvement of more than one chamber of the heart.
  Atrial thrombus
The usual site for an atrial thrombus would be the left atrial appendage. Thrombi are not seen as mobile masses but as irregular lobulated masses. They can have a laminated appearance and the classical feature is low signal on gradient-echo MRI sequences owing to the presence of haemosiderin (blooming artefact). Ventricular thrombi can form too, it is usually a sequelae of a previous myocardial infarction which has healed leaving a hypomobile portion of the ventricular wall. Adjacent to that part of wall there is relative stasis sufficient to facilitate thrombus formation.",FALSE,Atrial myxoma is the most likely diagnosis in this case because it is the most common primary cardiac tumor and is usually associated with a mid-diastolic murmur with presystolic accentuation. It is also typically hyperintense to the myocardium on T1 and T2 MRI.,2,,B,FALSE,,B,TRUE,A

The lymphatic drainage of the liver is via superficial and deep lymph vessels. The majority of these lymph vessels join those in the porta hepatis before entering the hepatic lymph nodes.
The majority of the efferent lymph vessels from the hepatic lymph nodes drain into the coeliac lymph nodes.
Some of the deep lymphatic vessels follow the hepatic veins to the vena caval foramen in the diaphragm to drain into the phrenic lymph nodes.
The lymphatic vessels on the ‘bare area’ of the liver (where there is no peritoneum present on the diaphragmatic surface) pass through the vena caval foramen to drain into the phrenic and mediastinal lymph nodes.
Lymph from the phrenic and mediastinal nodes subsequently drains into the right lymphatic duct and thoracic duct.",FALSE,"I chose this answer because the majority of the efferent lymph vessels from the hepatic lymph nodes drain into the splenic lymph nodes.

Select ONE answer only.,SBA: Central Nervous and Head & Neck,The Eustachian tube opens into the hypotympanum,The stapes is connected to the malleus,The head of the malleus is situated in the mesotympanum,The Prussak space is found behind the inferior part of the tympanic membrane,The short crus of the incus is situated in the mesotympanum,A,61%,6%,12%,6%,14%,"Explanation:
The anatomy of the middle ear is complex but important and contains a number of specific anatomical terms.
  Image © Medical Exam Prep
  The epitympanum, also known as the attic, is the superior portion above the highest point of the tympanic membrane. It contains the head of the malleus and the short crus of the incus (These give the appearance of an ice-cream cone on an axial CT).
  Image © Medical Exam Prep
  The Prussak space is found within the epitympanum and is a tiny space at the top of the tympanic membrane, just behind the scutum. Its clinical relevance is that it is the usual origin for pars flaccida cholesteatomas.
The aditus ad antrum connects the epitympanum to the mastoid antrum and thence the mastoid air cells.
The tegmen mastoidium (tegmen means roof) is the point at which the mastoid air cells meet the temporal lobe of the brain.
The tegmen tympani is the point at which the upper most extent of the epitympanum reaches the temporal lobe of the brain.
    Image © Medical Exam Prep
  The mesotympanum is the space posterior to the tympanic membrane and contains the body of the incus, the manubrium (connected to the tympanic membrane) and the anterior process of the malleus and the stapes. The stapes is connected to the incus as well as the oval window of the cochlea. There is also a round window placed more inferiorly which bulges to allow compression waves transmitted from the stapes to the oval window to travel through the cochlea.
The hypotympanum is a far less significant space than either the epitympanum or the mesotympanum. It begins at the inferior most extent of the tympanic membrane. The Eustachian tube opens into the hypotympanum anteriorly.",FALSE,"I chose number 5 because it is an anatomical fact that the short crus of the incus is situated in the mesotympanum.

The biliary tract, or biliary tree, is a pathway through which bile that has been secreted by the liver is transported to the duodenum.
The biliary tract begins as the interlobular bile ducts form the right and left hepatic ducts. These two ducts merge to form the common hepatic duct, which is situated alongside the hepatic vein.
The common hepatic duct exits the liver and joins with the cystic duct from the gallbladder to form the common bile duct. The common bile duct is sometimes referred to as the ‘trunk of the biliary tree’ and together with the hepatic artery and hepatic portal vein forms the central axis of the portal triad.
The common bile duct passes downwards posteriorly to the proximal duodenum and joins with the pancreatic duct from the pancreas to form the ampulla of Vater. The ampulla of Vater opens into the duodenum and the release of bile at this point is controlled by a muscular valve called the sphincter of Oddi.

A Meckel’s diverticulum is a vestigial remnant of the vitellointestinal duct. It is the commonest malformation of the gastrointestinal tract, being present in around 2% of the population. They are twice as common in men than women.
When present a Meckel’s diverticulum is located in the distal ileum, usually within 60-100 cm (2 feet) of the ileocaecal valve. They are usually 3-6 cm (approx. 2 inches) long and may have a greater lumen than that of the ileum.
They are commonly found as an incidental finding, particularly at appendicectomy. The majority are asymptomaticbut they can present with the following complications:
Haemorrhage (25-50% of complications)
Intestinal obstruction (10-40% of complications)
Diverticulitis
Perforation
  Meckel’s diverticula run antimesenterically but receive their blood supply from the mesentery of the ileum, and a typical feeding vessel called the vitelline artery can be identified. They are typically lined with ileal mucosa but frequently contain ectopic mucosa, the two commonest types being gastric (50%) and pancreatic (5%). More rarely colonic or jejunal mucosa may be present.

Charcot joint (also known as neuropathic osteoarthropathy)
More commonly this condition is seen in the forefoot or ankle joints in patients with advanced diabetes mellitus. Although only a small number of Charcot joints affect the shoulder most of those caused by a syrinx do. A syrinx is also a more common cause of Charcot joints than either multiple sclerosis or Hansen disease (leprosy).
  Causes of Charcot joints
Diabetes mellitus
Syringomyelia
Hansen disease (Leprosy)
Poliomyelitis
Neurosyphilis
Multiple sclerosis
  Whatever the underlying cause, compromise to the sensory nerves supplying the relevant joint prevent the normal protective mechanisms and as such minor trauma does not have sufficient an environment to heal correctly. This is particularly pertinent to weight-bearing joints. Loss of sympathetic control of the same area is also thought to play a part.
The joints can take either an atrophic pattern, a heterotropic pattern or a mixed pattern.
The radiological findings can be summarised as the 5Ds, namely:
Destruction
Dislocation
Density (due to heterotrophic new bone formation and sclerosis)
Disorganisation
Debris
Characteristically there is no juxtaarticular osteoporosis but joint effusions are common. In the case of the shoulder, the humeral head may be completely destroyed.
  Atrophic

12871,205212,You are performing an FNA for a 76-year-old lady with an enlarged inguinal lymph node. The histology is reported as squamous cell carcinoma. Which of the following is the LEAST likely primary source?,"SBA: Genito urinary, Adrenal, Obstetrics & Gynaecology and Breast",Bladder cancer,Vulval cancer,Vaginal cancer,Cervical cancer,Anal cancer,A,71%,5%,3%,13%,7%,"Explanation:
Although around 10% of bladder cancers are squamous cell in nature, involvement of the inguinal nodes is considered non-regional disease. Bladder cancer normally spreads first to the internal and external iliac nodes.
  Women
Cervical cancer is predominantly squamous cell in origin and spreads initially via the obturator nodes and thence to the internal or external iliac nodes. The lymphatic spread of vaginal cancer depends to an extent on its exact location. Cancers situated in the upper two thirds of the vagina behaves in a similar way to cervical cancer (Obturater, internal and external iliac nodes) but those in the lower third do spread first to the inguinal or femoral nodes as local disease as do vulval cancers.
  Men
Penile cancer is well known to spread to the inguinal lymph nodes as regional disease and indeed at the time of presentation most patients (>90%) will have palpable nodes here. By contrast anal cancer spreads first to the perirectal nodes and then to the inguinal nodes, although both are considered as regional disease. One point of controversy would be that anal cancers are actually far more prevalent than penile cancers so although the latter may be more likely to be found in inguinal nodes as an index presentation, arguably the former is a more likely diagnosis by sheer volume of numbers.
Scrotal skin cancers are usually squamous cell in origin and spread via the lymphatics, initially to the inguinal nodes. Of note involvement of the inguinal nodes may be contralateral to the site of the index tumour since both sets of inguinal nodes drain the whole scrotal sac. Testicular tumours however, will only spread to the inguinal region as regional disease if the patient has undergone previous inguinal or scrotal surgery. In the absence of prior intervention the inguinal region is considered as a non-regional area for testicular tumours.
  Proportion of squamous cell carcinomas
Penile cancer
  >90%
Anal cancer
Scrotal skin cancer
Cervical cancer
Vulval cancer
Vaginal cancer
>80%
Bladder cancer
<10%
Prostate cancer
<1%
Testicular cancer
<1% (can be a site of metastatic SCC though)
  Prostate cancer is nearly always adenocarcinoma not squamous cell carcinoma and secondly regional nodes in the context of prostate cancer would be internal and external iliac nodes. Inguinal nodes are therefore less likely to be from prostate cancer; these would be considered as non-regional metastatic disease.
When not adenocarcinomatous in origin, prostate cancer can (rarely) be transitional cell, sarcoma, lymphoma or adenoid cystic cancer.
Inguinal lymph node involvement would be considered regional disease for anal cancers in both sexes as well as penile and scrotal skin cancers in men and vulval or vaginal cancers in women.
  Bladder cancer
Imaging the bladder with MRI is a balancing act between sufficient distension to achieve adequate sensitivity rates without the images being compromised by motion due to the discomfort of having a full bladder for the duration of the scan.
On T2 the detrusor muscle returns low signal but the continuity of this layer will be disrupted if there is invasion.
The T1 images are more useful for evaluating lymph node involvement and any bony metastases.
Post-contrast images are of limited use in bladder cancer imaging. Some literature does support their use since the tumours tend to enhance early, whereas the muscle layer undergoes only delayed enhancement but since the bladder mucosa and submucosa also enhance in the early phase the appearances can be confusing to the untrained eye.",FALSE,"I chose 4.

Aspiration
This classically causes lower lobar bronchiectasis. Many different factors in childhood can cause an increased risk of aspiration. Of course, no two patients with cerebral palsy are alike and the information in the question is purposefully brief, however cerebral palsy which affects swallowing coordination or central tone can indeed put the patient at risk of aspirating.
  Cystic Fibrosis
This is causes bronchiectasis but predominantly affects the upper lobes. Presentation, if not before this point, is with recurrent chest infections. Otherwise it can present in the neonatal period with a meconium plug. Adults often suffer from subfertility, pancreatitis and malabsorption.
  Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia
This predominantly causes bronchiectasis in the middle and lower lobes. Only 50% have Kartagener’s syndrome (A triad of situs inversus, sinusitis and bronchiectasis), hence the normal heart position in the question. Affected men are infertile, and women are subfertile.
  ABPA
This is generally only seen in asthmatics and is characterised by central bronchiectasis particularly in the mid-zones and sometimes upper zones. Centrilobular nodules are also a feature.

What is the most likely diagnosis?",SBA: Cardiothoracic and vascular,Thymoma,Pericardial fat pad,Bronchogenic cyst,Pericardial cyst,Lymphoma,A,41%,3%,6%,36%,14%,"Explanation:
Thymoma
The right cardiophrenic angle is not a particularly classical location for a thymoma, by any stretch of the imagination. It would not be impossible however and with the correct demographic, as well as symptoms of diplopia pointing towards a diagnosis of myasthenia gravis this is the most likely answer given here.
A pericardial fat pad would be of negative Hounsfield units.
Both pericardial and bronchogenic cysts could easily be 20HU however neither fit with the symptom of diplopia.
Lymphomas can be seen as a solitary lobulated mediastinal mass arising from thymic tissue in children but this is the wrong age group and would not be a classical presentation for lymphoma.
  The thymus is a specialized primary lymphoid organ of the immune system, within which T-lymphocytes mature. After puberty it decreases in size and is slowly replaced by fat.
It is mainly located within the superior mediastinum, posterior to the manubrium sterni. A certain degree of anatomical variation exists and in some individuals it can extend superiorly into the neck, or inferiorly into the anterior mediastinum.
The thymus has an asymmetrical, flat shape with a lobular structure. The lobules are comprised of a series of follicles, which consist of a medullary and a cortical portion.
The cortex is located peripherally within each follicle and is mainly composed of lymphocytes, supported by a network of finely branched epithelial reticular cells.
The medulla is located centrally within each follicle and contains fewer lymphocytes and a greater number of epithelial reticular cells. It also contains Hassall’s corpuscles, which are the remains of the epithelial tubes.",TRUE,"Thymoma is the most likely diagnosis in this case because it is the most common type of tumor found in the cardiophrenic angle. It is usually seen on CT scans as a mass of 20HU or higher. Thymomas are usually benign and can be treated with surgery or radiation therapy. Other tumors found in the cardiophrenic angle are much less common and include pericardial fat pad, bronchogenic cyst, and lymphoma.",2,,A,FALSE,,D,FALSE,D
14216,205212,A baby boy born at full term is started on phototherapy for presumed physiological jaundice at day 3. Two days later his condition has improved and he is discharged home. On day 16 he is re-referred by the Health Visitor with ongoing jaundice. An ultrasound scan is normal and a HIDA scan shows no bowel excretion after 6 hours. Which of the following would help differentiate between neonatal hepatitis and biliary atresia? Select ONE answer only.,SBA: Paediatrics,Liver biopsy,Time of presentation,Negative viral serology,No excretion on a HIDA scan at 6 hours,Normal ultrasound scan,A,59%,3%,3%,28%,7%,"Explanation:
The differential diagnosis here is between biliary atresia and neonatal hepatitis. After 6 hours and 24 hours the former should show no bowel uptake on a HIDA scan since the unformed biliary ducts do not produce the bile to excrete to the bowel which would normally give rise to the tracer uptake there. In contrast, patients with neonatal hepatitis have an anatomically normal liver and so produce small amounts of bile, even if the overall liver function is severely derranged. Thus if there is any bowel activity at 24 hours biliary atresia can be excluded. If there is bowel activity at 6 hours then biliary atresia can also be excluded in a far shorter timeframe. Ideally if there is no bowel activity at 6 hours then the patient should be brought back for further images at 24 hours. Strictly speaking this does not constitute a 'repeat' HIDA scan since no further tracer injection has been given. Unfortunately the option of 'continue the HIDA scan to 24 hours' has not been provided. Certainly if there is no bowel uptake after 24 hours then a biopsy should be done to exclude hepatitis and confirm biliary atresia as the diagnosis. Accurate diagnosis of biliary atresia is crucial since a portojejunostomy (Kasai procedure) performed early (around 1-2 months of age) is associated with higher success rates with the native liver.
  Biliary atresia
This presents between two weeks and two months of life as an obstructive jaundice picture (i.e. conjugated hyperbilirubinaemia). The extrahepatic bile ducts have become fibrosed and cause obstruction. Initial investigation is usually with ultrasound and an echogenic ‘triangular cord’ structure in the porta hepatitis is considered pathognomic. The gallbladder may be normal, small or non-visualised and therefore contributes little to the diagnosis. Further investigation is often with a HIDA scan. If there normal activity within the liver (usually after only a few minutes) but there is no visualisation of tracer within the bowel after 24 hours this is considered diagnostic. Phenobarbitol can be given in the days leading up to the scan to increase biliary output.
  Neonatal hepatitis
This usually presents within the first month of life with jaundice. After blood tests, ultrasound is the first line of investigation and may show global increased echogenicity, or may be considered to be normal. A HIDA scan should show some bowel uptake (indicating a slowly functioning biliary system with biliary excretion into the bowel) though this may take the full 24 hours to be visualised. Neonatal hepatitis may be caused by hepatitis viruses, but also CMV, HSV, and toxoplasmosis. Non-viral causes include alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency, and inborn errors of metabolism.",FALSE,"I chose number 4 because a HIDA scan at 6 hours can help to differentiate between neonatal hepatitis and biliary atresia. In cases of biliary atresia, there will be no excretion of the radiotracer after 6 hours, whereas in cases of neonatal hepatitis, there will be some excretion. Therefore, a negative HIDA scan at 6 hours can help to confirm a diagnosis of biliary atresia.",1,"3. A question about clinical reasoning, what would help differentiate between two diagnoses?

Osteoid osteoma
These are small benign tumours but which can be quite symptomatic, classically with pain relieved by aspirin. The majority form in the diaphyses of long bones but the posterior elements of the spine is another classic location.
The radiolucent nidus and symptoms of night pain in a young patient point to either an osteoid osteoma or an osteoblastoma. The final diagnosis comes down to size. <1.5cm is definitely an osteoid osteoma, and >2 cm is definitely an osteoblastoma. There is a nasty grey area somewhere between the two sizes.
On x-ray the radiolucent nidus may not be fully appreciated and the abnormality which is picked up will be the consequential sclerotic solid periosteal reaction. In the spine there may be a painful scoliosis concave towards the lesion as a result of adjacent muscular spasm.

Non-accidental injury
It is the responsibility of all members of the healthcare profession to be alert to the possibility of non-accidental injury. For radiologists, there are specific findings which should alert the reporter to the possibility of non-accidental injury. These include:
Lower limb injuries in a non-ambulant child

12146,205212,A 32-year-old lady with pre-eclampsia who delivered 2 days ago by normal vaginal delivery develops sudden cortical blindness. She has been receiving treatment for pre-eclampsia both before and after delivery. She is taken for a scan. What are the expected imaging features?,SBA: Central Nervous and Head & Neck,Pituitary haemorrhage and ischaemic changes to both occipital lobes,Low attenuation and loss of grey/white matter differentiation in both occipital lobes,Enlarged pituitary with high T1 and low T2 signal,Subarachnoid haemorrhage,Normal CT head,A,30%,55%,11%,2%,3%,"Explanation:
This is not a straightforward question; the answers given in this question are deliberately confusing but this question is ultimately aimed at PRES (posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome). Although the pathophysiology of PRES is not fully understood, in imaging terms it is specifically the subcortical white matter which is involved and shows ischemic changes (low attenuation on CT and high T2/FLAIR on MRI). Loss of grey/white matter differentiation implies territorial infarction with cytotoxic oedema as opposed to the vasogenic (and reversible) oedema of PRES where the grey/white matter junction is preserved. Given this, we can choose the answer given over the other option mentioning the occipital lobes despite the red herring of the pituitary haemorrhage. Pituitary haemorrhage in a post-partum setting points to Sheehan syndrome but around 10% of patients with PRES also have intraparenchymal haemorrhage.
Classically PRES presents as a visual disturbance in a pregnant or post-partum patient with pre-eclampsia and CT shows haemorrhages in the posterior fossa. The main underlying pathological process is vasogenic oedema. Technically PRES is not exclusive to pregnancy or the post-partum period, and often with a history (implied or provided) of pre-eclampsia. Other causes such as SLE or immunosuppression are also technically feasible. Cortical blindness is the classical symptom.
Sheehan syndrome is pituitary apoplexy due to hypovolaemic shock and can be consequential to delivery. At the time of apoplexy, the predominant issue for the patient is the systemic hypovolaemia for which aggressive management is usually already being pursued. In the early days following the delivery, the first hypopituitary issues to manifest is usually any or all of hyponatraemia, diabetes insipidus or hypothyroidism. At this time the MRI findings can vary from a normal appearing pituitary through to the classic pituitary apoplexy appearances of an enlarged pituitary with high T1 signal. Patients can also present many months or years later with panhypoituitarism at which time an MRI will usually show an empty sella.
 ",TRUE,"The correct answer is 3 and 4. Pituitary haemorrhage and ischaemic changes to both occipital lobes are expected imaging features in a patient with sudden cortical blindness. Pituitary haemorrhage is a common complication of pre-eclampsia, and ischaemic changes to the occipital lobes can occur due to reduced blood flow to the area due to the pre-eclampsia. Subarachnoid haemorrhage is not expected in this case, and a normal CT head would not be expected either.",3,"3. A question about the management of a patient, what is the most appropriate treatment?

14584,205212,You are reviewing a cardiac MRI scan which shows a 9mm mass in the left ventricle. It is attached to the left coronary cusp by a stalk and returns intermediate signal on the T1 weighted sequence. What is the most likely diagnosis? Select ONE answer only.,SBA: Cardiothoracic and vascular,Papillary fibroelastoma,Cardiac metastasis,Cardiac sarcoma,Atrial thrombus,Atrial myxoma,A,75%,2%,2%,2%,19%,"Explanation:
Papillary fibroelastoma
These tumours are rare even for cardiac tumours but yet are the most common cardiac tumour to be associated with the valves. Rather counter-intuitively, they do not cause valvular dysfunction. They are usually quite small and, like myxomas, relatively mobile, attached by a stalk, and able to prolapse through a valve but where myxomas usually arise from the interatrial septum, papillary fibroelastomas grow from the valve itself. Histopathologically they are gelatinous tumours resembling sea anemones with multiple papillary projections. They can act as a focus for platelet aggregation leading to systemic emboli for left sided masses or pulmonary emboli for right sided masses. On MRI they are often low in signal on T2 weighted sequences owing to their fibrous nature.
  Atrial thrombus
The usual site for an atrial thrombus would be the left atrial appendage. Thrombi are not seen as mobile masses but as irregular lobulated masses. They can have a laminated appearance and the classical feature is low signal on gradient-echo MRI sequences owing to the presence of haemosiderin (blooming artefact). They do not enhance. Ventricular thrombi can form too, it is usually a sequela of a previous myocardial infarction which has healed leaving a hypomobile portion of the ventricular wall. Adjacent to that part of wall there is relative stasis sufficient to facilitate thrombus formation.
  Atrial myxoma
These are the most common benign neoplasms of the heart. Although usually sporadic, they can occur as part of Carney syndrome (atrial myxoma, facial/buccal pigmentation, sertoli tumours of the testis and multiple other findings. Not to be confused with Carney triad - pulmonary hamartomas, gastric leiomyosarcomas and extra-adrenal paragangliomas). The finding of a small mass attached to the interatrial septum by a stalk is classical. Their mobility allows some to prolapse through the relevant atrioventricular valve during the cardiac cycle. They can act as a focus for platelet aggregation leading to systemic emboli for the more common left sided masses or pulmonary emboli for right sided myxomas. Iso or hypointensity on T1w MRI is typical.

2. Gastric leiomyosarcoma (GIST) Facial/ buccal pigmentation
3. Extra-adrenal paraganglioma
Sertoli tumour of the testis
Pituitary adenoma
    Cardiac sarcoma
There are many different types of cardiac sarcoma. Cardiac sarcomas are the most common cause of primary malignant cardiac tumours. Their presentation usually relates either to embolic phenomena such as TIAs or symptoms from invasion such as pericardial effusion. In contrast to myxomas or fibroelastomas, malignant lesions tend to have a broad attachment to the heart wall. Another useful differentiating feature on imaging is the involvement of more than one chamber of the heart.
  Cardiac metastases
Metastases are significantly more common than cardiac sarcomas meaning metastases are the most common malignant cardiac tumours. In contrast to myxomas or fibroelastomas, malignant lesions tend to have a broad attachment to the heart wall. Tumours can be from lung or breast cancer, lymphoma, leukaemia and malignant melanoma.",FALSE,"Atrial myxoma is the most likely diagnosis because it is the most common primary cardiac tumor, and it typically presents as an intracardiac mass attached to the left coronary cusp by a stalk and returns intermediate signal on the T1 weighted sequence. Papillary fibroelastoma, cardiac metastasis, and cardiac sarcoma are all rarer forms of cardiac tumors, and atrial thrombus is an accumulation of blood within the heart chambers and not a tumor.",2,,A,TRUE,,A,TRUE,A

In anaphylaxis the dose of adrenaline is as follows:
Adrenaline            1ml of 1:10,000 IV               or            0.5ml of 1:1000 IM

13978,205212,A 3-day-old baby girl is referred for an ultrasound scan following the discovery of frank blood in her nappy. The baby was born at term by normal vaginal delivery and has been doing well since birth. What should you expect to find on the ultrasound scan? Select ONE answer only.,SBA: Paediatrics,"Nothing, normal finding",Haematometrocolpos,Bilateral cerebriform adrenal glands,Unilateral adrenal neoplasm,Ovarian neoplasm,A,88%,7%,3%,1%,1%,"Explanation:
Vaginal bleeding in neonatal girls is a common phenomenon and simply represents the response of the normal uterine endometrium to the withdrawal from (maternal) oestrogens once the baby is born. It occurs within the first few days of birth and should last less than a week. No further investigation is necessary, and any abnormality found on ultrasound is an incidental finding.
  Mullerian duct anomalies (MDA)
The two Mullerian ducts form separately then fuse in the first trimester to form all the structures between the upper vagina and the fallopian tubes. The final part of the amalgamation of the two sides is resorption of the central uterine septum.  There are various classification systems the scope of which is subspecialist.
  Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH)
Normal-appearing adrenal glands does not exclude a diagnosis of CAH however usually the classical appearance for the adrenal glands in a case of CAH is of diffuse enlargement with a so-called 'wrinkled' morphology. The word 'cerebriform' is often used to describe them and compares their appearance to that of the brain. The usual hypoechoic cortex and hyperechoic medulla is still seen but the enlarged gland is folded upon itself giving the wrinkled appearance. The role of ultrasound is also to discern any normal male or female anatomy. The normal uterus can usually be identified, if present, but the ovaries may simply be too small at birth to appreciate. In contrast, the normal testes, where present, should be visible with ultrasound from birth. Females usually present with ambiguous genitalia whereas males can present later with severe electrolyte imbalances.",TRUE,"The ultrasound scan should show nothing, as normal findings, since the baby was born at term by normal vaginal delivery and has been doing well since birth. The frank blood in the nappy is likely due to normal physiological processes, such as the passage of meconium or the shedding of the umbilical stump.

Erosive osteoarthritis
This is an inflammatory version of osteoarthritis with a strong female preponderance. The pattern of involvement is that of standard osteoarthritis (distal interphalangeal joints) but the features have an inflammatory component with prominent erosions, particularly of the middle of the distal end of the middle phalanges leading to a classical gull-wing appearance.

10506,205212,A 56-year-old man with an enlarged prostate and a mildly elevated PSA undergoes a nuclear medicine bone scan which shows significant uptake in the lungs. He has a normal calcium and phosphate. His CXR shows tiny diffuse calcific densities. What is the most likely explanation?,SBA: Cardiothoracic and vascular,Alveolar microlithiasis,Secondary hyperparathyroidism,Tertiary hyperparathyroidism,Primary hyperparathyroidism,Silicosis,A,75%,7%,5%,1%,12%,"Explanation:
Alveolar microlithiasis
This condition falls under the 'common presentation of uncommon conditions' category. The patient develops tiny calculi in the alveoli during middle age. Typically the serum calcium and phosphate are normal and if the patient undergoes a nuclear medicine bone scan there is impressively high uptake diffusely in the lungs. Despite this the patient is often remarkably well.
  Hyperparathyroidism
Parathyroid hormone acts to increase calcium levels either by promoting reabsorption in the kidneys or by acting on the osteoclasts of the bones and leads to increased bone resorption. This is seen as generalised osteopenia and cortical thinning, particularly of the subperiosteal bone.
Primary hyperparathyroidism is usually caused by an autonomous adenoma (alternatively parathyroid hyperplasia or a parathyroid carcinoma). Medullary nephrocalcinosis is most commonly caused by primary hyperparathyroidism but does also occur with secondary and tertiary hyperparathyroidism.
Secondary hyperparathyroidism is a hyperplastic response of the parathyroid glands to the high phosphate and low calcium levels which accompany renal osteodystrophy. Soft tissue calcification is very much a feature of renal osteodystrophy. Confusingly the high circulating levels of phosphate in renal osteodystrophy leads to dystrophic mineralisation of trabecular bone which is seen as sclerosis; hence renal osteodystrophy is a cause of generalised increase in bone density despite hyperparathyroidism being a cause of osteopenia.
Tertiary hyperparathyroidism occurs when a patient with secondary hyperparathyroidism (ie chronic overstimulation of the parathyroid glands) goes on to develop an autonomous adenoma.
  Silicosis
Inhalation of silica leads to fibrosis. It is an occupational hazard associated with working in mines, quarries or with glass and ceramics. Chronic silicosis occurs following exposure over 10-20 years. Small nodules measuring a few millimeters in diameter form with an upper zone distribution (involvement of the upper zones is classical for inhalational diseases). Around 10% of these nodules calcify and this can be seen on imaging as multiple small foci of calcification in the upper zones. Lymph node enlargement is also a feature with eggshell calcification often quoted as a dominant feature of silicosis despite only being present in around 5% of patients. Intralobular septal thickening is often seen but pleural involvement is not a feature of silicosis.",FALSE,"Primary hyperparathyroidism is the most likely explanation for the patient's symptoms because it is characterized by an elevated PSA, enlarged prostate, and calcific densities in the lungs.

This question is a little sparse on detail.
In theory SLE could present as seizures subsequent to cerebral abscess formation. On the whole, vascular events are more common, but less likely to present as seizures. The brain parenchyma is not often involved in SLE however the exception is haemorrhage or abscess formation. (Neuropsychiatric symptoms do occur.). There is a rare entity called Libman-Sacks endocarditis where sterile vegetations grow on the cardiac valves. Some sources say that these can be the focus for subsequent septic cerebral emboli.
  Wegener granulomatosis
Wegener granulomatosis has recently been re-christened as ‘granulomatosis with polyangiitis’. It can affect the CNS in a variety of ways. Granulomatous lesions, vasculitis causing small infarctions, and haemorrhage are all features. Classically the patient will have a ‘saddle’ nose due to collapse of the nasal septum and cartilaginous nasal bridge.
  Behcet syndrome
Behcet syndrome is classically described as a triad of oral and genital ulcers associated with one of several ocular manifestations. Its effect on the CNS tends to be as meningoencephalitis or venous sinus thrombosis. In theory either could present with seizures but it would be a stretch to describe oral ulcers as a facial rash.

Select one answer only.,SBA: Cardiothoracic and vascular,Rotation to the left,Rotation to the right,Poland syndrome,Swyer-James syndrome,Alpha-1-antitrypsin,A,56%,32%,6%,5%,1%,"Explanation:
Film rotation
Unfortunately it is more likely that technical features will cause unilateral hyperlucency than any of the pathological conditions which may feature in the differential diagnosis. Rotation of the patient to the left on a PA film will bring the left hemithorax away from the plate. The chest anatomy is such that in doing so the xray beam travels through less lung tissue in terms of depth than either the contralateral side in the same rotated patient or the left lung in an unrotated patient. The beam travelling through less lung tissue is therefore less attenuated and the lung appears hyperlucent on the resultant film
  Poland syndrome
Poland syndrome is a rare cause of a hyperlucent hemithorax on a CXR. There is hypoplasia or even aplasia of the chest wall musculature plus/minus breast. Abnormalities of the fingers on the same side such as syndactyly (fusion) or brachydactyly (shortening) can also occur and the ipsilateral ribs may also be abnormal.
  Swyer-James syndrome
In this condition, normal development of the infant lung is impeded by bronchiolitis (viral or mycoplasma) at an early age, with superadded acute airspace destruction. Consequently the affected lobe is small and lucent on the CXR due to air trapping. It is a differential diagnosis for a unilateral lucent hemithorax, along with a pneumothorax, very large pulmonary emboli and causes of decreased chest wall musculature such as Poland syndrome or, historically, polio. In an an exam situation Swyer-James syndrome is usually given as a teenage or young adult patient with a history of recurrent LRTIs. Air trapping, and bronchiectasis can also be described.
  Alpha 1 antitrypsin deficiency
Alpha-1 antitrypsin is a glycoprotein which is made in the liver and secreted. One of its functions in the lungs is to oppose the action of proteolytic enzymes the likes of which are secreted by white blood cells in order to counter sub-clinical bacterial infections. Since A1AT is deficient in these patients the unopposed action of the enzymes goes beyond the intended destruction of pathogenic bacteria and causes damage to the lung tissue. Patients are usually diagnosed in early adulthood when their symptoms develop. On CT there is panacinar emphysema, particularly affecting the bases. Bronchiectasis is also often seen. Cirrhosis is another feature of this disease and should be looked for on imaging. ",TRUE,"I chose 5. Rotation to the left because it is the most common cause of an incidental hyperlucent left lung on a PA chest radiograph of a 30-year-old woman.

Inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion, this disease results from an excess of copper within the body due to the inability of the liver to excrete it. It can present in childhood with cirrhosis but later presentations are more likely to be due to the neuropsychiatric manifestations. Clinically adolescent or adult patients develop tremor and dysarthria due to copper deposition in the lentiform nucleus. The classic diagnostic feature is Kayser-Fleischer pigment rings in the eyes. Radiologically the following features can be seen:
Hepatic manifestations: The liver appears normal on MRI since fatty infiltration effectively cancels out the paramagnetic effects of copper
Musculoskeletal manifestations: Generalised osteoporosis, subarticular cysts, chondrocalcinosis and arthropathy which can mimic CPPD
CNS manifestations: White matter atrophy and T2 hyperintensities predominantly affecting the basal ganglia and thalami. T1 signal is also high in these areas, differentiating it from many of the other basal ganglia disorders. There is a classical feature of ‘sparing of the red nucleus’ leading to an appearance known as the giant panda sign at the level of the pons.
  Alkaptonuria also known as ochronosis
This condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. It is caused by excessive circulating levels of homogentisic acid (HGA) when the enzyme which would usually degrade it is deficient. HGA has an affinity for collagen and accumulates in the connective tissues throughout the body. In visible light HGA has a blackish colour and thus the disease can be diagnosed in infancy when a baby’s nappies are stained black by the presence of HGA in the urine. By the time patients reach their 20s pigmentation may be visible in their skin, particularly the ears. This is initially a dark yellow colour (hence the term ochronosis, from ‘Ochre’ in Greek meaning a dark yellow colour) but can progress to blue-grey and black.
In imaging chondrocalcinosis is the most prominent feature, with calcification and destruction of the intervertebral discs. Premature osteoarthritic changes to the hands, feet, shoulders, hips and knees will also develop as the collagen deteriorates. Deposition in the heart and kidneys too leads to cardiac and renal failure.
  Haemochromatosis
The primary version of this disease can be inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion. Excess dietary iron is absorbed and this accumulates in all tissues of the body leading to various different problems.
Secondary haemochromatosis can arise if patients receive numerous blood transfusions without sufficient chelation to mitigate against the iron overload.
Cirrhosis – the presence of the excess iron in the liver leads to unusual signal properties on an MRI scan. Iron is paramagnetic and causes spin dephasing. T2* and T2 sequences are particularly vulnerable to this effect but lower than expected signal will be seen on all sequences. Importantly the signal from the spleen and bone marrow should be normal. By contrast they will be involved in cases of transfusional siderosis.
Generalised osteoporosis
Hook like osteophytes on the radial aspect of the metacarpal heads – these are highly characteristic
Chondrocalcinosis, particularly affecting the knees
Insulin dependent diabetes
Congestive cardiomyopathy
Skin pigmentation
  Calcium pyrophosphate dehydrate disease (CPPD) also known as pseudogout
CPPD can present in an acute or subacute fashion but is also seen as a chronic cause of joint inflammation. It may be misdiagnosed as simple osteoarthritis owing to its often bilateral and symmetrical distribution but there are also a couple of areas of the body which can be affected in particular, and which would be unusual for isolated degenerative changes.
The patellofemoral joint – joint space loss here can be extremely striking with almost complete preservation of the joint space at the medial and lateral compartments of the knee
Triangular fibrocartilaginous complex of the wrist – calcification
Radiocarpal joints – degenerative changes without involvement of the DIPs and PIPs
  Enteropathic arthropathy
Sacroiliitis and spondylitis are the hallmarks of enteropathic arthropathy. It is an important seronegative spondyloarthropathy. Outside of the axial skeleton, other features common to all seronegative spondyloarthropathies are also found. These include arthritis in the hands and feet, uveitis, and enthesitis (especially calcaneal). Interestingly although it is most commonly discussed in relation to Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis, only 5 and 10% respectively of patients with these conditions will develop enteropathic arthropathy. By contrast of patients with Whipple disease, around 75-90% of them will suffer from enteropathic arthropathy. Infection with Salmonella, Shigella and Yersinia are also known associations.",FALSE,"Calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease (CPPD) is the most likely diagnosis in this case. CPPD is a type of arthritis caused by the deposition of calcium pyrophosphate crystals in the joints and is often associated with osteoporosis.

Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease
There are three types of this prion transmitted disease; the one linked to the BSE (bovine spongiform encephalopathy) epidemic of the late 1980s and 1990s, a rare familial variant, and finally a sporadic version which accounts for the vast majority of the cases. Clinically there is a rapidly progressive dementia with ataxia and myoclonus which should be the give-away feature even before imaging features are discussed. On MRI, the reported finding is of high T2/FLAIR signal in the basal ganglia bilaterally and symmetrically (particularly the putamen). The pulvinar sign is often described in association with cJD which describes high FLAIR signal in the pulvinar thalamic nuclei (called the hockey stick sign). Strangely the signal changes are a rare cause of restriction of diffusion, seen as bright areas on DWI. Important negatives for this condition are the lack of enhancement with contrast and the lack of white matter involvement (since the white matter is protected by its myelin sheath).

      Huntington disease
There are relatively few radiological manifestations of Huntington disease. The usual one described is atrophy of the heads of the caudate nuclei with consequential prominence of the adjacent lateral ventricle frontal horns with a ‘box’ like appearance. Various studies have been done to quantify the extent of this atrophy.
  Parkinson's disease
Generalised cerebral atrophy occurs with Parkinson's disease but is a highly non-specific feature. There are, however, radiological findings in the midbrain which although subtle, are far more specific. Parkinson's disease occurs when there is neuronal loss in the substantia nigra, specifically the pars compacta of the substantia nigra. On a T2 weighted MRI image this appears as blurring of the intermediate signal intensity line which separates the two adjacent low intensity structures (these are the pars reticulata of the substantia nigra and the red nucleus).
A DAT scan (Dopamine Active Transfer) can be performed to confirm the diagnosis. This uses the radiopharmaceutical I-123 Ioflupane to image dopamine transporters in the brain. These are present in the highest concentrations in the putamina and caudate nuclei. In patients with true Parkinson's disease (as opposed to other similar conditions), there will be loss of uptake in the posterior putamen. This can be an asymmetric finding. Colloquially speaking the appearance of a these areas on a normal patient resembles a comma and on a patient with Parkinson's disease they become more like full stops.

Please note that the question asks which answer is NOT a cause of medullary nephrocalcinosis.
Disseminated pneumocystitis causes cortical necrosis and calcification, similar to disseminated MAI. The other conditions are associated with medullary nephrocalcinosis. Incidentally, medullary nephrocalcinosis is 20 times more common than cortical nephrocalcinosis.
The most common cause of nephrocalcinosis is hyperparathyroidism (followed closely by renal tubular acidosis). Ehler Danlos syndrome and Beckwith-Weidman (as well as Caroli disease) are associated with medullary sponge kidney (which should always be considered if there is unilateral medullary nephrocalcinosis.

Although hopefully a septic arthritis would be being considered from the outset, and the patient should be receiving antibiotics even prior to their MRI scan, the damage done to a joint by a purulent effusion is best avoided by washing the joint out. This will have a faster therapeutic effect than antibiotic therapy and is therefore the priority in this case. The diagnosis of a septic joint is confirmed by aspiration of purulent joint fluid. Septations within the effusion are a strong indicator of septic arthritis.
  Septic arthritis
Septic arthritis in any age group is a surgical emergency and the joint must be washed out as soon as feasible in order to avoid irreversible joint damage caused. Clinical suspicious must therefore be high, not least because early x-rays may be normal. Initial investigation should be with ultrasound and echogenic debris may be found within a joint effusion. The diagnosis is confirmed by aspiration of purulent joint fluid. The condition can also be readily appreciable on MRI which is very sensitive for early joint damage. Synovial oedema can be seen as high signal on T2 with enhancement post-gadolinium on T1 fat saturated sequences.

Which of the following findings would alert you to the possibility of a shunt occlusion?,SBA: Gastrointestinal,Hepatofugal flow in the portal vein,Hepatopetal flow in the portal vein,Hepatopetal flow in the hepatic vein,Hepatofugal flow in the hepatic vein,Hepatopetal flow in the shunt,A,63%,14%,8%,7%,8%,"Explanation:
The words centripetal and centrifugal are derived from Newtonian physics to do with objects moving in a circular fashion. They come from Latin as follows:
    Centripetal = falling towards the centre
  Centrifugal = fleeing the centre
  Centri = centre
Petere = to fall                                                                     
Fugere = to flee (the word fugitive has the same origins)          
  When applied to hepatic circulation the words are taken to indicate the direction of flow within a given vessel, namely whether flow is into (hepatopetal) or out of (hepatofugal) the liver.  Thus, ordinarily the portal vein would be expected to demonstrate so-called hepatopetal flow and the hepatic vein hepatofugal flow. Flow within the shunt cannot reasonably be described as either but should be described according to the systems it is bridging. The shunt is there to relieve portal hypertension caused by cirrhosis and should thus be taking blood from the portal system and shunting it to the systemic system. Hepatofugal flow in the portal vein suggests that the shunt is occluded with blood from the portal vein reversing to flow via the splenic vein and any pre-existing collateral pathways to the systemic circulation.",FALSE,"I chose number 4 because hepatofugal flow in the hepatic vein is an indication of a shunt occlusion. This is because when a shunt is occluded, the flow of blood is reversed, and instead of the normal hepatopetal flow of blood, there is a hepatofugal flow. This can be seen on an ultrasound scan as a decrease in flow velocity and an increase in the diameter of the hepatic vein.",2,"This question falls under category 2: A question about clinical judgement, what is the correct diagnosis?",A,FALSE,,B,TRUE,A

For this patient the presence of a satellite nodule in a contralateral lobe is considered as metastatic disease.
In an ideal world every trainee radiologist would have all the intricacies of staging for all tumour types committed to memory. A qualified subspecialist radiologist could reasonably be expected to be extremely familiar with the staging for cancers within their remit but for the majority of trainees it is simply not practical to memorise each and every staging scheme. As an overall strategy, the most important stages to understand are those which change the management for patients. Of note with lung cancer, at Stage IIIb the management changes significantly because stage IIIb and stage IV patients are unresectable. Another useful facet to lung cancer (TNM) staging is satellite nodules:
Same lobe = T3
Different lobe = T4
Contralateral lung = M1
For lung cancer some of the important staging features are as follows (IASLC 8th ed):
  T1 tumours are <3cm
N1 = ipsilateral hilar nodes
T2 tumours are 3-5cm but dont involve the carina
N2 = ipsilateral mediastinal or subcarinal nodes
T3 tumours are 5-7cm OR with extension to:
Chest wall
Diaphgragm
Pericardium
Satellite nodules within the same lobe
  N3 = contralateral hilar, mediastinal or supraclavicular nodes
    M1 = bilateral lesions, malignant pleural effusion, distant metastases
T4 tumours affect mediastinal organs, carina, vertebral body
    T1 and T2 both have further subdivisions.
Unresectable tumours are T4, N3 or M1.
Beyond TNM staging patients with similar prognostic outcomes are given further stages. Simple observation of these groupings reveals the following:
Stage I patients MUST be N0
Stage III patients MUST have a sum ≥ 3 (ie T2N2M0, or T1N2M0). [NB some patients with Stage II will also have a sum of 3 (for example T2N1M0) however ALL stage III patients have a sum ≥ 3.]
Stage IIIb patients are unresectable → stage IIIb is denoted either by N3 status or T4N2.",TRUE,"The presence of a satellite nodule in the lingula is indicative of a more advanced stage of lung cancer, which is associated with a poorer prognosis. This is because the satellite nodule indicates that the cancer has spread beyond the primary tumor site, making it more difficult to treat and, in turn, leading to a poorer overall prognosis.",3,"3.

Please note that the question asks which feature is NOT consistent with an inhaled foreign body.
Inhaled foreign body
This is an important differential diagnosis to consider in paediatrics, particularly in younger mobile children in whom an accurate history may not be forthcoming. Not all foreign bodies are radio-opaque. Inhaled foreign bodies are slightly more likely to enter the right main bronchus than the left owing to its straighter course but left sided foreign bodies are by no means unheard of. Usually an inhaled foreign body will cause a ball-valve mechanism on the affected side leading to air-trapping and over-inflation. This gives rise to the CXR features described in the vignette. It is worth noting that the chest x-ray can also be normal in around a third of cases.",FALSE,"Diaphragmatic flattening is not a consistent finding with an inhaled foreign body. While an inhaled foreign body can cause an increase in intrathoracic volume, it is more commonly associated with air trapping and/or obstruction of the airways, which can lead to increased transradiance, rib splaying and tension pneumothorax.",2,"This question falls under category 2: A question about clinical judgement, what is the correct diagnosis?",A,TRUE,,A,TRUE,A
9321,205212,A 45-year-old woman is being reviewed in the gastroenterology clinic. She has symptoms of worsening crampy abdominal pains which have been developing over the last few months. A year ago she finished treatment for cervical cancer but follow up blood results have been normal since then. She undergoes a CT scan for further investigation. There is mural thickening to the terminal ileum and a stretch of distal ileum located within the pelvis. Which of the following is the most likely explanation for these findings?,SBA: Gastrointestinal,Radiation enteritis,Typhlitis,Crohn disease,Tuberculosis,Infective colitis,A,80%,9%,7%,3%,1%,"Explanation:
Radiation enteritis
Acutely following radiation therapy there is cell death of the rapidly turning over mucosal cells of the bowel wall, and particularly of the terminal ileum. This leads to ulceration and mucosal/submucosal oedema.
Subacutely to chronically the radiation damage leads to endarteritis obliterans and chronic mesenteric ischaemia. The bowel does heal but fibrous changes persist and strictures can form. There is no link in severity between the acute and chronic forms; the presence or absence of the one does not predict the other.
The bowel loops can be seen to be fixed in the same positions on sequential contrast studies by a desmoplastic response within the mesentery. Patients complain of crampy abdominal pain from intermittent obstruction as well as diarrhoea.
  Neutropenic colitis also known as typhlitis
The name typhlitis comes from the greek typhlos meaning blind ending sac and relates to the involvement of the caecum. Although the rest of the bowel can be affected it is the caecum which bears the brunt of this disease. The caecal wall becomes thickened (to >4mm) and markedly oedematous; the appearance may be so extreme that it may seem more like a large fluid density mass than part of the bowel. Barium studies carry a significant risk of perforation and should be avoided but would show oedema and severe ulceration. On CT transmural oedema with adjacent fat stranding is found. It develops in immunocompromised patients, in particular those undergoing induction chemotherapy prior to bone marrow transplantation.
  Tuberculosis
Abdominal tuberculosis most commonly affects the ileocaecal junction with thickening of the ileocaecal valve and narrowing of the terminal ileum. This can be seen on fluoroscopic examination as the Fleischner sign or umbrella sign where the gaping ileocaecal valve abuts the thin, strictured terminal ileum. Local lymph node enlargement with or without central low attenuation to the lymph nodes may be seen on CT. Multiple different lesions in multiple sites (i.e. skip lesions) is also a feature and a characteristic feature is of elevation of the margins of an ulcer which follow the orientation of lymphoid follicles. In the colon this means the margins are elevated in the transverse plane but in the terminal ileum they are longitudinal.
The involvement of the ileocaecal valve and the presence of skip lesions means that a key differential diagnosis is Crohn disease. Over half of cases of abdominal tuberculosis will have concurrent ascites whereas this is a relatively rare feature for Crohn disease and can be used as a discriminator.
Specifically relating to the stomach, tuberculosis can cause pyloric stenosis, multiple deep ulcers on the lesser curve, and linitis plastic type narrowing of the antrum.
  Crohn disease
Crohn disease is characterised by discontinuous (skip lesions) transmural non-caseating granulomatous inflammation. By contrast, ulcerative colitis is characterised by continuous mucosal inflammation. Crohn disease is usually diagnosed in adolescence or young adulthood and patients present with non-specific abdominal pains, diarrhoea, weight loss and anaemia. Crohn disease can affect any part of the entire length of the gastrointestinal tract, in contrast to ulcerative colitis which affects only the colon, but owing to the high concentration of lymphoid tissue in the terminal ileum the vast majority of patients will have terminal ileal involvement, in particular thickening of the iliocaecal valve. Aphthous ulceration is common and on endoscopy a cobblestone appearance to the mucosa can be seen where the thickened and oedematous wall is broken up by deep longitudinal fissures. Deep ‘rosethorn’ ulcers can be seen on fluoroscopic studies. Strictures and fistulae characterise the chronic sequela of this disease.

Questions on MRI are becoming more frequent in the 2A to reflect modern practice and an understanding of useful sequences and techniques is essential. Diffusion weighted imaging is being used more frequently to problem-solve in subcentimeter nodes and the presence of restricted diffusion within a node is a feature suspicious for malignancy. Normal lymph nodes can and do demonstrate restricted diffusion too but this effect tends to be more marked in pathological lymph nodes though there is some overlap between benign and pathological lymph nodes at the low end of the spectrum. Nevertheless, a lymph node which is found to be strongly restricting diffusion, even if it appears otherwise morphologically benign should be suspected to be involved.",FALSE,"Post contrast enhancement is the most suggestive feature of metastatic nodal involvement on MRI. This is because contrast enhancement helps to differentiate benign from malignant lesions, as malignant lesions are more likely to enhance after the contrast agent is administered.

Radiotherapy stricture
In patients receiving radiotherapy to the perineum for prostate cancer, a urethral stricture can be a late complicating feature, occurring around 1-2 years following treatment. The stricture usually occurs at the bulbomembranous portion of the urethra, just distal to the prostate itself (i.e. at the prostatic apex). Patients who have previously undergone a TURP are at increased risk of developing a post-radiotherapy stricture. They will be seen as a smooth stricture on imaging.
Traumatic stricture
A previous traumatic straddle injury classically gives a short segment stricture of the bulbous urethra. In a straddle injury, the urethra is compressed against the pubic symphysis, often from a bicycle crossbar. A gonococcal infection causes a long, irregular stricture of the distal bulbous urethra.
Iatrogenic stricture
These can form following instrumentation, including prolonged catheterisation. They tend to be longer and smoother than other types of stricture. They usually occur at the main pre-existing narrow areas of the membranous urethra, bladder neck and meatus.
Infectious stricture
Gonococcal infections classically cause long strictures. They are most commonly irregular in nature and located in the bulbous urethra. The distal bulbous urethra is most frequently affected.",FALSE,"I chose this answer because iatrogenic stricture is the most likely cause of a smooth stricture at the apex of the prostate in this patient.

This patient is haemodynamically stable. In the absence of a confirmed diagnosis, a CT angiogram should be performed. Depending on local availability, MR angiography can be a useful adjunct to CT for patients who are allergic to iodinated contrast although clearly the patient must be sufficiently stable to undergo an MRI scan.
In a haemodynamically stable patient for whom the diagnosis was in doubt the correct study to perform would be a cardiac-gated CT aortogram:
Unenhanced CT thorax - This phase is important in the diagnosis of an intramural haematoma which can be difficult to pinpoint on subsequent phases.
Arterial phase CT Thorax and Abdomen - It is important to know whether a dissection extends into the abdominal aorta or iliac arteries as well as whether there is any compromise of the mesenteric or renal arteries.
(Portal venous phase CT Thorax and Abdomen - This phase is not always performed but is most useful if previous repairs have been undertaken and a leak is suspected)
  Although not universally available, cardiac-gating of CT scans for acute aortic syndrome is optimal to reduce the rate of false positives which are a well-documented pit-fall to non-gated studies.

Multicystic dysplastic kidney
A multicystic dysplastic kidney is the second most common cause of a neonatal abdominal mass. The normal renal architecture is entirely replaced by a non-functioning mass of cysts separated from one another by fibrous tissue. The overall appearance is said to resemble a bunch of grapes. If unilateral, the condition can be asymptomatic or can present as recurrent urinary tract infections. The most important distinction to make is from hydronephrosis which is overall the most common cause of a neonatal abdominal mass. In hydronephrosis the apparent 'cysts' will communicate whereas in multicystic dysplastic kidney the cysts are separate from one another. A MAG3 would show no renal function on that side at all (as opposed to just reduced function).

Approximately 10% of meningiomas occur at the olfactory groove. Although usually benign, meningiomas can cause oedema when they become larger.

Which would be the best sequence to confirm the diagnosis?,SBA: Gastrointestinal,T1 with contrast,T1 without contrast,T2 with contrast,T2 without contrast,STIR,A,44%,3%,8%,13%,32%,"Explanation:
Perianal fistulae
Most perianal fistulas are thought to result from an initial infection in an intersphincteric gland. Abscesses here would normally drain into the anal canal but fistulous tracts can develop if the glands is occluded. Slices should be obtained axially to the path of the rectum. Owing to the inflammation and granulation tissue in a fistulous tract there is avid enhancement with gadolinium. T1 post-contrast images are therefore the best means by which to assess patients with active disease. If the high signal persists on unenhanced T1 images it is likely to be due to the presence of haemorrhage. STIR sequences can also be useful to track the high signal of a fistulous tract but spatial resolution is usually poorer. Chronic fistulas develop fibrotic tissue which becomes low in signal on both T1 and T2.
Perianal fistulae are classified according to their relationship to the external sphincter with inter-sphincteric fistulae being the most common since the external sphincter provides a reasonably robust barrier to the spread of an infection.

Lymphoma
Testicular lymphoma is classically seen in an older man with bilateral hypoechoic lesions.
Teratomas, Yolk sac tumours, Embryonal cell tumours and Choriocarcinomas all fall into the category of Non-seminomatous Germ Cell tumours. Of these, Embryonal cell tumours make up the vast majority.
Teratoma
This is the second most common tumour in boys under 5. aFP is usually normal. Under ultrasound it appears as a heterogenous complex mass.
Yolk sac tumour
This makes up 80% of childhood testicular tumours.This can often present as testicular enlargement without a focal mass. It metastases to lung which is the most common site of recurrent disease.
Embryonal cell tumour
This is the second most common testicular tumour. It is the most aggressive of all testicular tumours with visceral metastases common and 5 year survival of 30%.
Choriocarcinoma
This is a rare tumour affecting 20-30-year-olds with rapid metastases to lung, liver, GI tract, brain. Often causes haemorrhage in both primary and metastatic lesions. Causes gynaecomastia in 10% due to raised serum hCG.
In reality, tumours are often mixed histological types (around 35% cases). Testicular tumours can also be diagnosed with a strong pre-test probability based solely on age as detailed in the table below. In reality, the role of the radiologist however does not need to be as complex as suggesting the final histological diagnosis. Establishing the presence of a testicular mass is sufficient.

8861,205212,A 76-year-old lady with a biopsy proven rectal adenocarcinoma undergoes an MRI scan for local staging. Her case is discussed at the local MDT and the radiologist points to invasion of a thin black line on the T2 weighted sequences. Since the tumour has clearly breached this line the decision is made that she should receive neo-adjuvant chemotherapy prior to surgical resection instead of going straight for surgery. Which structure is seen as a thin black line on T2 weighted sequences in this way?,SBA: Gastrointestinal,Mesorectal fascia,Muscularis fascia,Anorectal angle,Serosa,Muscularis mucosa,A,70%,7%,2%,10%,11%,"Explanation:
In an ideal world every trainee radiologist would have all the intricacies of staging for all tumour types committed to memory. A qualified subspecialist radiologist could reasonably be expected to be extremely familiar with the staging for cancers within their remit but for the majority of trainees it is simply not practical to memorise each and every staging scheme. As an overall strategy, the most important stages to understand are those which change the management for patients.
  Rectal cancer MRI
The muscularis propria is the outer wall of the rectum and shows up as low signal on T2 weighted sequences.
Since the rectum (like the oesophagus) does not have a serosa, once spread beyond the muscularis propria into the mesorectal fat has occurred (ie a T3 tumour), nodal involvement is also feasible. The mesorectal fascia is a thin plane of connective tissue which contains fat, the rectum, local lymph nodes as a distinct anatomical entity and is of paramount importance in rectal cancer management. Spread beyond the mesorectal fascia denotes a T4 tumour. MRI is excellent for local staging of rectal cancer because the mesorectal fascia is seen clearly as a thin black line on T2 weighted sequences and its involvement or lack thereof can be readily discerned. In contrast, the tumour appears as intermediate signal on T2, distorting the normal anatomy. The fascia is also referred to as the ‘CRM’ which stands for circumferential resection margin and relates to the surgical operation performed for rectal tumours, namely a total mesorectal excision (TME). The proximity of the tumour extent to the CRM is prognostically important; tumours with a >1mm margin before they reach the CRM are far less likely to recur. A <1mm margin is taken as involvement of the CRM.
A distinction is also drawn between lower and upper rectal tumours (as defined by distance from the anorectal angle). Inferiorly there is far less fat contained within the mesorectal fascia and consequently tumour can involve the CRM earlier on.
  Rectal cancer staging
The following table heavily paraphrases the TNM stages for rectal cancer. There are multiple subdivisions which are not covered here either. The focus for this table is radiologically distinct entities as well as the points at which the management alters.
  Stage Radiology Management
<T3 Not involving the muscularis propria Surgical resection (must also have N0, if N1 or N2 then would need neo-adjuvant chemotherapy)
T3 Involving muscularis propria Neo-adjuvant chemoradiotherapy → surgery →+/- post-op chemotherapy

A uretherocoele will not present as a lump per se, since any residual urine within it is there passively i.e. it is not contained.
Anatomy is the key to differentiating between the various female urogenital cysts most of which are, for the most part, asymptomatic incidental findings.

    Urethral diverticulum also known as urethrocoele
Dysuria, dyspareunia and post-void dribbling are classical for this condition. An outpouching of the urethral mucosa protrudes through the smooth muscle. This is seen on MRI as high T2 signal adjacent to or surrounding the urethra. Urinary stasis within the diverticulum predisposes patients to the formation of calculi, which can be seen as low signal on the T2 scan, and adenocarcinoma which will enhance with gadolinium.
  Gartner duct cyst
These are usually found incidentally on MRI scans but can cause dyspareunia. They do not communicate with the urethra and would be unlikely to cause post-void dribbling. They are remnants of the Wolffian ducts and occur superiorly in the anterolateral wall of the vagina. On imaging they appear straightforwardly cystic. For the most part they occur sporadically but they can also be seen in conjunction with renal agenesis or ectopia and are also typical of a rare condition called Herlyn-Werner-Wunderlich syndrome. This condition causes duplication of all or part of the female genital tract with unilateral haematometrocolpos and ipsilateral renal agenesis. 
  Skene duct cyst
These are retention cysts of the paraurethral ducts and usually they are asymptomatic. On MRI they are seen inferior to the pubic symphysis but lateral to the external urethral meatus. Signal characteristics reflect their cystic nature with high T2 signal but fluid-fluid levels may also be present if there has been intracystic haemorrhage.
  Bartholin gland cyst
The bartholin glands secrete lubricating fluid into the inferior third of the vagina. They are found in highest numbers at the posterolateral aspect of the inferior vagina. Although usually asymptomatic, when infected or inflamed a Bartholin gland cyst can present as a painful lump. On MRI they show as high T1 signal owing to the mucoid fluid.
  Ectopic ureter
The ureter normally inserts into the trigone of the bladder but ectopic insertions do occur. If these are below the external urethral sphincter the patient may experience dribbling symptoms however these are likely to have been present from birth. An ectopic ureter may be an isolated diagnosis or may form part of a VACTERL presentation and there is an affiliation to renal duplexity. Vesico-ureteric reflux is also very common since the normal valve mechanism is not present to prevent it. Abnormal ureteric anatomy is well demonstrated either with fluoroscopic studies or a highly T2 weighted sequence on an MRI scan.",FALSE,"The most likely diagnosis for this patient is a Bartholin gland cyst. This is because the patient is reporting symptoms that are consistent with this condition, such as discomfort on passing urine and post-void dribbling, as well as pain during sexual intercourse. The GP's physical examination of the patient has also revealed a tender area on the anterior vaginal wall, which is another common symptom of a Bartholin gland cyst.",2,,E,TRUE,,A,TRUE,A

An ectopic pregnancy occurs when the fertilised egg implants outside of the uterus. Ectopic pregnancies occur in the Fallopian tubes in the majority of cases (>95%). Other locations can occur, for example the abdomen, cervix and ovary, but these are all rare.
The commonest anatomical location for an ectopic pregnancy to occur in the Fallopian tube is the ampulla. The approximate percentages of ectopic pregnancies occurring in each part of the Fallopian tubes is as follows:
The ampulla – 70%
The isthmus – 10-15%
The infundibulum – 10-15%
The uterine part – 2-5%",TRUE,"I chose the ampulla of the Fallopian tube as the commonest anatomical location for an ectopic pregnancy to occur because the ampulla is the widest and longest portion of the Fallopian tube, making it the most likely area for a fertilized egg to become implanted.

The colon is the part of the large intestine that is situated between the caecum and the rectum. It receives digested food from the small intestine, from which it absorbs water and ions to form faeces. It is approximately 150 cm in length and is divided into four parts.
  1. Ascending colon:
This is the first part of the colon and is retroperitoneal. It ascends upwards from the caecum before turning right at a 90 degree angle at the right colic flexure (hepatic flexure) to become the transverse colon. It is approximately 20 cm long.
  2. Transverse colon:
This is the second part of the colon and is intraperitoneal. It extends transversely across the abdomen from the right colic flexure until it reaches the left colic flexure (splenic flexure) close to the spleen. Here it turns another 90 degrees inferiorly to become the descending colon. The transverse colon is the least fixed part of the colon. It is approximately 50 cm long.
  3. Descending colon:
This is the third part of the colon and is retroperitoneal in the majority of people. It extends inferiorly down the abdomen from the left colic flexure passing over the lateral border of the left kidney. At the point that it turns medially it becomes the sigmoid colon. It is approximately 30 cm long.
  4. Sigmoid colon:
This is the final part of the colon and is intraperitoneal. It extends downwards in an ‘S’ shape from the left iliac fossa to the level of the S3 vertebra. It is approximately 50 cm long.

He is on no medications which might provoke this and denies the use of any performance-enhancing steroids. A testicular ultrasound is performed which shows a mass in the left testicle. Which of the most likely diagnosis?,"SBA: Genito urinary, Adrenal, Obstetrics & Gynaecology and Breast",Germ cell tumour,Hodgkin disease,Non Hodgkin lymphoma,Teratoma,Sertoli cell tumour,A,44%,0%,1%,2%,53%,"Explanation:
For a patient to develop gynaecomastia as a consequence of testicular cancer the tumour must be oestrogenic. Sex cord stromal tumours can produce oestrogen and present in this way, as can germ cell tumours. The classical tumour to be linked with gynaecomastia as an index presentation is the sex cord tumour Leydig cell tumours since around a third of cases present as gynaecomastia. That being said, when tumour incidence is accounted for, technically more patients who present with gynaecomastia will actually have a germ cell tumour of either a seminomatous or non-seminomatous variety. If germ cell tumours are therefore pitched against sex cord tumours in a question the exact wording of the question is crucial. Certainly Leydig cell tumours (Sex cord tumours) are more closely linked with gynaecomastia but there are undeniably fewer of them.

These account in total for only around 10% of testicular tumours but have some interesting characteristics.
Leydig cell tumours - classically these cause hormone imbalance and can present as gynaecomastia. Around a third of patients will present in this way. Most of these tumours are actually benign. There are two peaks in age prevalance at 5-10years and 20-30years
Sertoli cell tumours - These are much less common, less likely to produce hormones and therefore gynaecomastia but can be associated with syndromes such as Peutz-Jegher syndrome, or the Carney syndrome. They classically arise in young boys but are by no means rare at all any age.

  Germ cell tumours
Germ cell tumours are divided into seminomas and non-seminomatous varieties. They are very common and comprise almost half of all testicular tumours. They can often be found incidentally or subsequent to any trauma which might cause the patient to self-examine and discover a testicular lump. Alternatively they can present as a vague dull scrotal aching sensation with no lump.
Lymphatic drainage is to the retroperitoneum. Para-aortic lymph nodes are therefore regional. Involvement of the internal, external and common iliac nodes however, is considered non-regional. Only if there has been previous scrotal or inguinal surgery disrupting tissue planes are inguinal or external iliac artery nodes considered regional.
They typically are found in patients in their 40s. Testicular tumours can be diagnosed with a strong pre-test probability based solely on age as detailed in the table below. On ultrasound there will be an intratesticular low reflectivity well-defined mass. Colour doppler flow can be seen within the mass.

What is the most likely explanation?",SBA: Paediatrics,Osteoid osteoma,Osteblastoma,Shin splints,Reticulum cell sarcoma,Adamantinoma,A,89%,2%,3%,1%,5%,"Explanation:
Osteoid osteoma
These are small benign tumours but which can be quite symptomatic, classically with pain relieved by aspirin. The majority form in the diaphyses of long bones but the posterior elements of the spine is another classic location.
The radiolucent nidus and symptoms of night pain in a young patient point to either an osteoid osteoma or an osteoblastoma. The final diagnosis comes down to size. <1.5cm is definitely an osteoid osteoma, and >2 cm is definitely an osteoblastoma. There is a nasty grey area somewhere between the two sizes.
On x-ray the radiolucent nidus may not be fully appreciated and the abnormality which is picked up will be the consequential sclerotic solid periosteal reaction. In the spine there may be a painful scoliosis concave towards the lesion as a result of adjacent muscular spasm. CT is used to confirm the diagnosis as the nidus is readily appreciable.
  Osteoblastoma
Osteoblastomas are quite rare, even for bone tumours. To all intent and purposes they can be considered as large osteoid osteomas. They occur in slightly older patients than osteoid osteomas but most patients are still under 30-years-old. Around a third arise in the posterior elements of the spine, sometimes giving a painful scoliosis, a further third can be found in the long bones and roughly the remaining third arise in the small bones of the hands and feet.
  Reticulum cell sarcoma also known as lymphoma of bone
Bony involvement is much more common in non-Hodgkin lymphoma than Hodgkin disease. Bony lymphoma can present as a dull aching pain but may be very difficult to appreciate on x-ray as it gives a permeative pattern of destruction with the cortex becoming involved only late on in the process. Most cases however, will have an associated soft-tissue mass.
  Adamantinoma
These can arise in any long bone but curiously 90% of them are found in the tibia with most patients being in their 30s or 40s at the time of diagnosis. On x-ray the tumours are cortically based lytic lesions with a sclerotic margin and which may show slight cortical expansion. It is important to image the whole of the affected bone since multiple lesions are often present.

Patients, typically during exertion, who experience localised medial tibial tenderness are often said to have shin splints. The diagnosis is made on MRI, if not clinically, where bony oedema is graded up to the manifestation of an actual stress fracture.",TRUE,"Osteoid osteoma is the most likely explanation because it is a benign bone tumor that is most commonly found in children and adolescents.

What is the SINGLE most likely diagnosis?,SBA: Central Nervous and Head & Neck,Variant CJD,Huntington disease,Alzheimer's disease,Parkinson's disease,Lewy body dementia,A,70%,15%,1%,8%,6%,"Explanation:
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease
There are three types of this prion transmitted disease; the one linked to the BSE (bovine spongiform encephalopathy) epidemic of the late 1980s and 1990s, a rare familial variant, and finally a sporadic version which accounts for the vast majority of the cases. Clinically there is a rapidly progressive dementia with ataxia and myoclonus which should be the give-away feature even before imaging features are discussed. On MRI, the reported finding is of high T2/FLAIR signal in the basal ganglia bilaterally and symmetrically (particularly the putamen). The pulvinar sign is often described in association with cJD which describes high FLAIR signal in the pulvinar thalamic nuclei (called the hockey stick sign). Strangely the signal changes are a rare cause of restriction of diffusion, seen as bright areas on DWI. Important negatives for this condition are the lack of enhancement with contrast and the lack of white matter involvement (since the white matter is protected by its myelin sheath).

    Huntington disease
There are relatively few radiological manifestations of Huntington disease. The usual one described is atrophy of the heads of the caudate nuclei with consequential prominence of the adjacent lateral ventricle frontal horns with a ‘box’ like appearance. Various studies have been done to quantify the extent of this atrophy.
  Lewy body dementia
A core clinical feature to this dementia is the fluctuant nature of the symptoms. Parkinsonian features can also develop although these are usually subsequent to the memory decline. Visual hallucinations are also a feature. Radiologically there is a generalised decrease in cerebral volume (sparing the hippocampi). Temporo-parietal hypoperfusion on HMPAO Tc99m SPECT scanning is indicative of Lewy body dementia. Involvement of the occipital cortex, which is typically spared in Alzheimers disease, sets the two apart from one another on PET studies. The cingulate island sign has also been ascribed to Lewy body dementia, where there is preservation of metabolism in the mid-posterior cingulate gyrus. If present, this is said to be specific for Lewy body dementia.
  Alzheimer's disease
The radiological findings of this well known disease are diffuse sulcal and ventricular enlargement. There is a disproportionate effect to the anterior temporal lobes, hippocampi and sylvian fissures with sparing of the sensorimotor and visual cortices, thalami and cerebellum.
  Parkinson's disease
Generalised cerebral atrophy occurs with Parkinson's disease but is a highly non-specific feature. There are, however, radiological findings in the midbrain which although subtle, are far more specific. Parkinson's disease occurs when there is neuronal loss in the substantia nigra, specifically the pars compacta of the substantia nigra. On a T2 weighted MRI image this appears as blurring of the intermediate signal intensity line which separates the two adjacent low intensity structures (these are the pars reticulata of the substantia nigra and the red nucleus).",FALSE,"Huntington disease is the most likely diagnosis because it is characterized by progressive memory loss and movement problems, as well as high T2 and FLAIR signal in the basal ganglia bilaterally, as well as restriction of diffusion. Alzheimer's disease and Lewy body dementia can also cause memory loss and movement problems, but they typically do not show the specific MRI findings seen in Huntington disease. Parkinson's disease typically does not cause memory loss, and variant CJD usually causes rapid progression of symptoms and is not seen in the basal ganglia.",2,,B,TRUE,,A,FALSE,E

This history is classical for post-arthrography arthralgia with pain that begins at four hours and reaches a peak at 12 hours post-procedure. The pain is caused by a sterile chemical synovitis to the joint. A septic joint should always be considered where intervention has taken place however would manifest more insidiously over the course of the ensuing days.
The subacromial bursa should not communicate with the joint. If the patient has suffered a rotator cuff tear (particularly supraspinatus), or has undergone prior surgery then a communication may be present.",FALSE,"The most likely explanation of the patient's symptoms is that there was an abnormal contrast leak into the subacromial space.

Talcosis causes hypERdense nodules, not hypOdense nodules.
There are a number of ways in which recreational drug use can affect the patient and be seen radiologically.
Talcosis - embolisation of particulate matter injected intravenously gives rise to centrilobular micronodules which may be high density.
Septic emboli - secondary to non-sterile intravenous injection and endocardial vegetations. Cavitating lung nodules associated with clinical manifestations of infection.
Apical bullae/pneumothorax - associated with inhalational drugs, cannabis, cocaine, ecstasy, amphetamines
Pulmonary oedema - Perihilar airspace opacification with or without pleural effusions. Associated with cocaine, heroin, methamphetamine use.

The ileocaecal junction appears thickened and there is a moderate volume of ascites Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?,SBA: Gastrointestinal,Tuberculosis,Carcinoid,Stromal tumour,Peritoneal mesothelioma,Osteosarcoma metastasis,A,84%,9%,5%,3%,0%,"Explanation:
Tuberculosis
Abdominal tuberculosis most commonly affects the ileocaecal junction with thickening of the ileocaecal valve and narrowing of the terminal ileum. This can be seen on fluoroscopic examination as the Fleischner sign or umbrella sign where the gaping ileocaecal valve abuts the thin, strictured terminal ileum. Local lymph node enlargement with or without central low attenuation to the lymph nodes may be seen on CT. Multiple different lesions in multiple sites (i.e. skip lesions) is also a feature and a characteristic feature is of elevation of the margins of an ulcer which follow the orientation of lymphoid follicles. In the colon this means the margins are elevated in the transverse plane but in the terminal ileum they are longitudinal.
The involvement of the ileocaecal valve and the presence of skip lesions means that a key differential diagnosis is Crohn disease. Over half of cases of abdominal tuberculosis will have concurrent ascites whereas this is a relatively rare feature for Crohn disease and can be used as a discriminator.
Specifically relating to the stomach, tuberculosis can cause pyloric stenosis, multiple deep ulcers on the lesser curve, and linitis plastic type narrowing of the antrum.
  Stromal tumour also known as GIST (Gastrointestinal stromal tumour)
70% of these occur in the stomach with most of the remainder being found in the small bowel. Clinical presentation varies slightly with the exact location but dysphagia and early satiety are common, as are sequela from mucosal ulceration and bleeding. They can occur as a feature of neurofibromatosis type 1 and are also discussed in connection to the Carney triad (Not to be confused with Carney syndrome). On imaging they may be occult or appear as a well-circumscribed submucosal mass. The low attenuation is attributable to central necrosis within the mass. Characteristically however they tend to enlarge extraluminally into the lesser sac, gastrosplenic or gastrohepatic ligaments. Of note, lymph node enlargement is specifically not a feature and an alternative diagnosis should be sought if lymph node enlargement is present.

  Carcinoid
These tumours are relatively low-grade and slow growing. The appendix is the most common location for the primary lesion and most commonly the diagnosis is made incidentally when the surgical specimen is examined post appendicectomy. Otherwise, they tend to present insidiously however and therefore are often found to have metastasized by the time of diagnosis. The classical appearance on CT is of a mesenteric soft-tissue density mass containing flecks of calcification and causing a striking desmoplastic reaction in the adjacent mesentry giving it a spiculated appearance. This mass is not the primary tumour but rather a mesenteric metastatic mass. The primary itself may be too small to appreciate with CT but can sometimes be seen as a small arterially enhancing lesion. They can be seen in isolation or in the context of MEN 1 or MEN 2a.
The so-called carcinoid syndrome of flushing, diarrhoea, and bronchospasm occurs when serotonin is released by hepatic metasteses into the systemic circulation. Around one in ten patients with a small bowel carcinoid present in this way. Heart failure can also occur due to fibrosis of the tricuspid and pulmonary valves secondary to the excess serotonin levels. On imaging the hepatic metastases are hypervascular, much like the primary lesion would be. There is a direct correlation between the size of the primary lesion and the likelihood of metastasis with 80% of those >20mm in diameter having nodal metastases and around half having hepatic metastases at the time of diagnosis.
Nuclear medicine is useful in the localisation and staging of carcinoid tumours.
  111I-Octreotide: This has the highest sensitivity of the two and is taken up by hepatic metastases as well as the primary lesion. It is used for initial staging and for assessing disease response following treatment.
123I-MIBG: This is a useful test for localising the 10% of carcinoid tumours which do not take up Octreotide.
  Osteosarcoma metastases
These are the classic calcium containing metastatic lesions. In the chest they can present as a pneumothorax.
  Peritoneal mesothelioma
This disease is far more common in men than women and tends to affect men in their 50s or 60s. Much like its thoracic counterpart, there is nodular thickening of the peritoneum. Ascites is also a feature however there tends to be disproportionately little ascites compared to the extent of the disease. Omental involvement can be nodular or cake-like.",FALSE,Carcinoid is the most likely diagnosis because it is the most common cause of thickening of the ileocaecal junction and ascites.

The most appropriate initial management would of course be fluid management and patient stabilisation if needed, however this would not necessarily constitute definitive management.
Interventional radiology is a developing subspecialty and has a significant role to play in the management of retroperitoneal haemorrhage. In many cases open surgery can be dangerous where the tamponade effect of the surrounding viscera is lost as soon as the surgery begins. In the interventional setting however a targeted approach can be undertaken with a variety of haemostatic options available to a skilled interventionalist.",FALSE,"Open repair is the best definitive management for a large left perirenal retroperitoneal haematoma. Open repair allows for direct visualization of the bleeding source and provides the opportunity to control the bleeding, repair any associated injuries, and evacuate the haematoma. Laparoscopic repair is not recommended for large haematomas due to the difficulty in controlling the bleeding and evacuating the haematoma. Pelvic binder application is not a definitive management option as it will not control the bleeding or evacuate the haematoma. Fluid resuscitation and blood transfusion may be necessary to stabilize the patient before definitive management, but these alone will not control the bleeding or evacuate the haematoma. Endovascular repair may be an option in some cases, but is not recommended for large haematomas due to the difficulty in controlling the bleeding and evacuating the haematoma.",2,"3.

In this question, the answer comes down to either a pivot shift or a clip injury. The two are very similar. The involvement of the ACL makes pivot shift the more likely of the two.
Bony contusions
Bruising to the bone can be detected around 2 days following an injury but may not resolve for many months thereafter. With regards knee injuries, it is often possible to discern the mechanism of injury from the pattern of bruising seen. The contusions follow fluid on MRI scans i.e. low in signal on T1 and high on T2 (and STIR). STIR is used to suppress the fat of the bone marrow thereby making the fluid stand out more.
  Clip injury and pivot shift injury
These two injuries are very similar. Both involve valgus stress on a flexed knee (such as a tackle to the knee during sports). A pivot shift injury also requires external rotation of the tibia. The three main structures most at risk during these injuries are:
Anterior cruciate ligament (especially in a pivot shift injury)
Medial collateral ligament (especially in a clip injury)
Medial meniscus (remember that the medial meniscus is attached to the medial collateral ligament)
If all three are present together it is referred to as the O’Donoghue triad. Since O’Donoghue defined this triad however, it has been discovered that lateral meniscal tears are actually more common with this type of injury than medial meniscus ones.
Bony contusions occur at the side of impact because the proximal tibia and distal femur impact on one another thus:
Lateral tibial plateau (posterolateral in pivot shift injury)
Lateral femoral condyle
  Transient lateral patella dislocation injury
When the patella dislocates laterally, its medial facet can impact onto the anterolateral corner of the lateral femoral condyle. Both areas become damaged and contusions can be seen on MRI. Often though, the patella reduces spontaneously and thus the exact mechanism of injury must be inferred from the imaging findings.
Joint effusion
Osteochondral injuries to the anterolateral femoral condyle and medial patella facet
Sprain or disruption to the medial retinaculum
  Hyperextension injury
These occur often following excessively forceful kicking. There will be bony contusions at the anterior aspect of the tibial plateau and femoral condyles. Either of the anterior or posterior cruciate ligaments may also be involved.
  Dashboard injury
As the name would suggest, this injury is usually stained by impact of the knee against the dashboard of a car during a road traffic incident. Force applied to the anterior aspect of the tibia when the knee is flexed leads to:
Osteochondral injury or fracture to the anterior aspect of the tibia
Posterior cruciate ligament rupture/sprain",FALSE,"Hyperextension injury is the most likely diagnosis in this case because the MRI scan revealed a tear of the anterior cruciate ligament and bony contusions at the lateral femoral condyle and lateral tibial plateau. These findings are consistent with a hyperextension injury, which is an injury caused by overextending the knee joint beyond its normal range of motion.",2,,C,TRUE,,A,TRUE,A

What is the most likely diagnosis?,SBA: Cardiothoracic and vascular,Septic emboli,Under anticoagulation,Metastatic lung cancer,Metastatic HCC,Primary tuberculosis,A,91%,7%,1%,1%,1%,"Explanation:
The history of a recent cardiological intervention suggest this to be the most likely diagnosis. 
The differential diagnosis for cavitating lesions is unusually memorable (CAVITY):
C = Cancer (Squamous cell carcinoma – either bronchogenic or metastatic, or adenocarcinoma)
A = Autoimmune granulomas (Wegener granulomatosis and Rheumatoid arthritis granulomas)
V = Vascular (septic emboli)
I = Infection (abscess, TB or cavitating pneumonias [strep, staph, aspergillus, legionella, klebsiella])
T = Trauma – pneumatocoeles
Y = Youth (ie congenital – CPAM, sequestration, bronchogenic cyst) These all form cysts, not true cavities as such.
  Under anticoagulation leading to embolus formation could occur, but these emboli would not necessarily lead to cavity formation.
Metastatic HCC – HCC usually metastasizes late in the disease. They can present either as solitary lesions, multiple lesions or as an infiltrative area but none of these would usually be described as wedge-shaped.
Metastatic lung cancer – lung cancer metastases can begin as nodules but there is no description of a primary lung mass.
Primary tuberculosis does not usually cavitate but by contrast cavitation can be seen in anything upto two fifths of post-primary tuberculosis cases.",FALSE,"Primary tuberculosis is the most likely diagnosis in this case because it is a common cause of cavitating lung nodules.

11801,205825,A baby is born by elective caesarean section for known congenital cardiac disease. Which of the following is not a conotruncal anomaly.,SBA: Paediatrics,Situs inversus,Double outlet right ventricle,Truncus arteriosus,Interrupted aortic arch,Transposition of the great vessels,A,83%,3%,2%,9%,2%,"Explanation:
In situs inversus the main vessels have developed correctly albeit back to front.
Conotruncal anomalies affect the development of the main vessels leading from the heart. Embryologically the aorta and pulmonary arteries begin as one single outlet before separating into two. Where this fails to occur correctly a conotruncal anomaly is seen. DiGeorge Syndrome (a microdeletion on chromosome 22) is associated with all conotruncal anomalies. The following are all conotruncal abnormalities.
  Double outlet right ventricle
DORV is one of the five Ts of cyanotic and plethoric congenital heart disease (Tingle - i.e. Single - ventricle. The others are Tricuspid atresia, Transposition of the great vessels, TAPVC, truncus arteriosus). As the name suggests, both great vessels (the aorta and pulmonary artery) arise from the right ventricle. Consequently it is logical that 100% of cases have a VSD to facilitate drainage of the left ventricle. If the pulmonary trunk is stenotic, as is usually the case, then the lungs will be oligaemic on a CXR. Conversely in the absence of pulmonary stenosis there will be plethora - this accounts for roughly 25% of cases but yet earns DORV its place in the 5Ts. The crux of the imaging findings, and the phrase to look out for in an exam question setting is that there is no continuity between the mitral valve and the adjacent semilunar valve. This finding is pathognomonic of DORV.
Both Edwards (trisomy 18) and Patau (trisomy 13) syndrome patients can exhibit rockerbottom feet and overlapping fingers although the findings are more closely linked with the former. DORV is associated with both trisomys.
  Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF)
TOF (not to be confused with trache-oesophageal fistula) causes cyanosis but without pulmonary plethora thus is not included in the 5 Ts.
The tetrat consists of:
VSD
Overriding aorta
Right ventricular hypertrophy (RVH)
RV outflow obstruction (hence pulmonary oligaemia)
  TOF is the most common cyanotic congenital heart disease presenting after 12 months of age. In ambulant children the classic finding is of squatting whereby the child squats following exertion in order to increase blood flow to the lungs. It usually presents by at least 3-4 months of age however, but at birth the condition can be concealed by shunting of blood through a patent ductus arteriosus (PDA). Another facet to the clinical presentation can be polycythaemia which takes place due to chronic low oxygen levels.
Owing to the RVH the cardiac apex is turned upwards contributing to an appearance referred to as ‘boot shaped’ to the cardiac shadow on a CXR.
There is a strong association with right sided aortic arch. Nearly all right sided arches are associated with some form of congenital heart disease and most of these are TOF. Conversely 25% of TOF patients also have a right sided aortic arch.
  Transposition of the Great Vessels (TGA)
TGA is one of the five Ts of cyanotic and plethoric congenital heart disease (The others are Tricuspid atresia, Tingle [ie single] ventricle, TAPVC, truncus arteriosus). Broadly speaking this presents either at birth (it is the most common cyanotic heart disease diagnosed in the first 24 hours of life), or at approximately two weeks of age. Two possible theorised reasons for the later presentation are the closure of the PDA and declining foetal haemoglobin levels leading to decompensation. When the great vessels are transposed there exists two independent circulations. This is therefore only compatible with life if a shunt mechanism also exists, such as an ASD, VSD or PDA. The CXR can be initially normal but develops an ‘egg on side’ appearance to the cardiac shadow. In some cases the transposition is ‘corrected’ where the ventricles are also switched such that the correct ventricle feeds the correct great vessel although the left and right sided circulations remain separate. In corrected transposition the CXR features of note are an apparently absent pulmonary trunk, and an abnormal aortic contour.
  Truncus arteriosus
Embryologically the great vessels begin as one 'conotruncus' which separates during development. When this separation process fails, the baby is left with a single outlet called a truncus arteriosus. On a CXR the baby will be plethoric with cardiomegaly and there are a number of associations which help point towards the answer in an exam question setting without the aid of an echocardiogram. Forked ribs, DiGeorge syndrome, a right sided arch, or an interrupted arch are all known associations.
  Interrupted arch
Fortunately interruption of the aortic arch is rare because it comes with a reasonably high mortality rate. The interruption usually occurs either just before or just after the origin of the left subclavian artery. Supply to the rest of the body distal to this point is maintained only via a patent ductus arteriosus (PDA). As well as a PDA most babies will also have a VSD leading to a triad of radiological findings (interrupted arch, PDA, VSD). On a CXR the normal aortic knuckle is absent. Another oft-quoted historical finding is the absence of the aortic impression on a barium swallow.",TRUE,"Situs inversus is not a conotruncal anomaly because it does not involve the heart's major vessels. Conotruncal anomalies involve the conotruncal region of the heart, which includes the aorta, pulmonary artery, and their major branches.

Myocardial scar / Chronic infarct
This is a non-reperfusable myocardial defect (chronic infarct). It gives a wall motion abnormality but would demonstrate thinned myocardium. The T2 signal is low. Scars demonstrate abnormal Thallium perfusion but does not redistribute with delayed thallium, and does not take up FDG.
  Stunned myocardium
This gives a wall motion abnormality with high T2 signal. There is normal perfusion on Thallium or sestamibi scanning which is a key differentiating feature against hibernating myocardium. It should be expected to spontaneously resolve, whereas hibernating myocardium will not resolve spontaneously.
  Hibernating myocardium
This can be seen as a wall motion abnormality, but also gives abnormal fixed perfusion. Hibernating myocardium redistributes delayed thallium and takes up FDG.
  Focal myocarditis

The peritoneal cavity is the potential space between the parietal and visceral peritoneum. It is the largest serosal sac in the body and secretes approximately 50 mls of lubricating fluid daily. Ascites is the accumulation of excessive amounts of fluid within the peritoneal cavity.
The peritoneal cavity can be divided into the greater and lesser peritoneal sacs. The greater sac comprises the majority of the peritoneal cavity. The lesser sac is smaller and lies posterior to the stomach and lesser omentum.
The greater sac can be further subdivided into two compartments by the mesentery of the transverse colon (the transverse mesocolon):
The supracolic compartment – which lies above the transverse mesocolon
The infracolic compartment – which lies below the transverse mesocolon

10026,205825,A 23-year-old man collides with one of the hurdles during an athletics race. Two months later he is still experiencing pain around the distal femur and undergoes an x-ray. There is a well defined partly calcified soft tissue mass underlying the tender area. A clear radiolucent zone separates it completely from the underlying bone which is otherwise normal. What is the most likely diagnosis?,SBA: Musculoskeletal and Trauma,Myositis ossificans,Malignant fibrous histiocytoma,Tumoral calcinosis,Gout,Osteosarcoma,A,91%,3%,4%,0%,2%,"Explanation:
Myositis ossificans
Trauma to the muscle causes local haemorrhage and necrosis of damaged muscle. The sequelae of this is calcification which can persist long-term. Large muscles are particularly prone to this and the typical patient is a young, active adolescent. Myositis ossificans appears as a calcified soft tissue mass underlying the area of clinical concern. A periosteal reaction may or may not be present but crucially there is no erosion of the underlying cortex, a fact which discriminates it from malignant fibrous histiocytoma. The string sign refers to the presence of a plane of normal tissue separating the mass from the bone and unlike a parosteal osteosarcoma, in myositis ossificans this plane will extend along the whole length of the mass completely separating it from the bone.
  Malignant fibrous histiocytoma (MFH)
A soft-tissue MFH is the most common subtype of MFHs and the most common malignant primary soft tissue tumour in the over 50s age bracket. It usually presents as a painless soft tissue mass which enlarges over a matter of months. They can be large at the time of diagnosis measuring tens of centimetres. On x-ray they appear as a partly calcified soft tissue mass. Cortical erosion of the underlying bone is an important diagnostic feature. On MRI it returns high signal on both T1 and T2 weighted sequences.
  Tumoral calcinosis
Surprisingly for the sometimes extreme appearance of this condition, it can be completely painless. Patients are typically black and in their teens or 20s. Around a third of cases are inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion. A biochemical defect in the metabolism of phosphorus leads to accumulation of hydroxyapatite fluid around the joints causing a foreign-body type granulomatous reaction and fibrous capsule development. On imaging this appears as a progressive and calcified soft tissue mass. The skin overlying the mass can ulcerate and exude a chalky or milk like fluid. Any or all of the hips, shoulders and elbows can be affected but characteristically tumoral calcinosis does not affect the knees. Importantly the underlying bones are normal, a feature which differentiates it from gout or pseudogout.
  Gout
Excess circulating urate levels leads to crystalisation of urate (monosodium urate crystals) within the joint spaces. An acute attack may be precipitated by any acute event such as trauma or surgery as well as a change in diet to include purine containing foods (liver, kidney, game meat, some seafood, alcohol). Historically chronic manifestations of this condition included the development of gouty tophi; white lumpy areas under the skin which could ulcerate and exude a chalky material. These are still seen today but far less so thanks to improved management strategies. Involvement of the first metatarsophalangeal joint is considered classical but involvement of the carpometacarpal joints of the hands is often most debilitating where it occurs. On x-ray the earliest radiological manifestation is a joint effusion. Joint erosions develop on the lateral corners of a joint but contrary to many other erosive processes the base of the ulcers has a sclerotic margin. Juxta-articular osteopenia is not often seen, a feature which acts as a good distinguisher from rheumatoid arthritis, which is thought to be because the attacks come in acute bursts during which time disuse osteopenia does not have the time to develop. Another reasonably specific feature of gouty arthritis is the preservation of the joint space itself until relatively late into the disease.

  These are bone forming tumours which can either be primary, or secondary. Primary osteosarcomas occur in young patients or young adults when the bones are more active during adolescence than in later life, and have a predilection for either the proximal tibia or distal femur i.e. around the knee joint. Secondary osteosarcomas occur as malignant degeneration of pre-existing bone lesions. Clinically they present as a painful mass with a fever. Pain on movement is also typical. In later disease patients may have a raised serum ALP. On x-ray they are poorly defined aggressive lesions with sunburst periosteal reaction and fluffy cloud-like osseous matrix. For staging the patient should receive an MRI of the entire of the affected bone (to rule out synchronous lesions), a nuclear medicine bone scan and a CT chest. Tissue biopsy should only be performed at tertiary referral centres where to mitigate the risk of seeding the biopsy tract, immediate tissue analysis with the option of immediate amputation can be performed.
In the case of a parosteal osteosarcoma, the attachment to the underlying bone may be thin and stalk-like but will be present. Depending on the view a radiolucent plane may seem present for some of the length of the tumour, giving rise to ‘string sign’ appearance, but an attachment to the parent bone will be present.

What is the most likely diagnosis?,"SBA: Genito urinary, Adrenal, Obstetrics & Gynaecology and Breast",Renal papillary necrosis,Primary hyperparathyroidism,Secondary hyperparathyroidism,Medullary sponge kidney,Struvite calculus,A,77%,1%,2%,7%,12%,"Explanation:
Renal papillary necrosis
The point at which the collecting ducts in the medulla converge to become a minor calyx is known as the renal papilla. The renal papilla marks the beginning of transitional epithelium; hence transitional cell carcinoma can occur within the upper tracts. The papillae are vulnerable to ischaemia of any cause. The blood supply to the papillae is via end vessels ostensibly supplying either the medullary vasa recta or small and tortuous calyceal vessels. Despite this dual supply, both sources are primarily for other purposes and the renal papilla can suffer the consequences of insufficiency of any cause. Some of the predominant causes of renal papillary necrosis can be remembered with the mnemonic POSTCARDS. 
Causes of renal papillary necrosis
Pyelonephritis
Obstruction
Sickle Cell Disease
Tuberculosis
Cirrhosis
Analgesic use
Renal vein thrombosis
Diabetes Mellitus
Systemic vasculitides
  Much of the damage and that which is demonstrable on imaging is explained by necrosis and sloughing off of the papilla to a greater or lesser extent. Signs such as tracks and horns, the lobster claw sign, signet ring sign or ball on a tee sign were originally described on IVU studies but translate reasonably well to CT urogram studies too. Filling defects within the collecting system occur when a papilla is complete sloughed off. These can go on to cause obstruction and hydronephrosis. The long term sequelae of renal papillary necrosis is calcification of the damaged papilla. The appearance is classically a garland pattern i.e. Many small or medium sized foci which appear to run in a line around the collecting system, at the junction of the pyramids and the collecting system. 
  Medullary sponge kidney
Dysplastic dilatation of the intramedullary collecting ducts permits urinary stasis which in turn promotes stone formation. Medullary Sponge Kidney is one of the main differential diagnoses for renal calcification. A quarter of cases are unilateral. This condition can be asymptomatic and noted incidentally or patients can be complicated by recurrent urinary tract infections, recurrent ureteric calculi or haematuria. The two main conditions seen in association with medullary sponge kidney are the collagen disorder Ehlers-Danlos syndrome and Caroli disease which causes cystic dilatation of the intrahepatic biliary ducts. On imaging there are characteristic ‘Aunt Minnie’ type appearances when medullary calcification can be seen on a plain abdominal radiograph. Ultrasound shows increased echogenicity to the renal pyramids even in the absence of medullary calcification. On an IVU the appearance of the dilated ducts is often described to be like a bouquet of flowers or a bunch of grapes and is sometimes termed a ‘medullary blush’.
  Urinary tract calculi
Ureteric colic is common and urinary tract calculi are even more so. There are many metabolic disorders which increase the risk of developing urinary tract calculi but many patients do develop calculi without any underlying cause. Stones can obstruct at any point along the urinary tract however the three narrowest points which are most liable to obstruction are the pelviureteric junction (PUJ), the vesicoureteric junction (VUJ) and at the point where the ureters cross the pelvic brim. As the ureter peristalses a characteristic extremely severe ‘loin-to-groin’ pain is experienced. A CT KUB study is a low dose, non-contrast, exam designed specifically to investigate for urinary tract calculi. A standard CT abdo/pelvis confers three times as much radiation dose at the very least. Although A CT KUB has a very high sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of opaque urinary tract calculi it is distinctly suboptimal for the evaluation of other causes of abdominal pain. Unfortunately since its introduction it has become a popular request for many a supposed loin-to-groin pain presentation.

  Hyperparathyroidism
Parathyroid hormone acts to increase calcium levels either by promoting reabsorption in the kidneys or by acting on the osteoclasts of the bones and leads to increased bone resorption. This is seen as generalised osteopenia and cortical thinning, particularly of the subperiosteal bone.
Primary hyperparathyroidism is usually caused by an autonomous adenoma (alternatively parathyroid hyperplasia or a parathyroid carcinoma). Medullary nephrocalcinosis is most commonly caused by primary hyperparathyroidism but does also occur with secondary and tertiary hyperparathyroidism.
Secondary hyperparathyroidism is a hyperplastic response of the parathyroid glands to the high phosphate and low calcium levels which accompany renal osteodystrophy. Soft tissue calcification is very much a feature of renal osteodystrophy. Confusingly the high circulating levels of phosphate in renal osteodystrophy leads to dystrophic mineralisation of trabecular bone which is seen as sclerosis; hence renal osteodystrophy is a cause of generalised increase in bone density despite hyperparathyroidism being a cause of osteopenia.
Tertiary hyperparathyroidism occurs when a patient with secondary hyperparathyroidism (i.e. chronic overstimulation of the parathyroid glands) goes on to develop an autonomous adenoma.",FALSE,"Medullary sponge kidney is the most likely diagnosis in this case because the IVU showed an egg-in-cup appearance with ‘tracks and horns’ in some of the calyces on the right, which is a classic sign of medullary sponge kidney.

Select ONE answer only.,SBA: Gastrointestinal,Graft vs Host disease,Hepatic veno-occlusive disease,Budd Chiari syndrome,Portal vein thrombus,Constrictive pericarditis,A,49%,32%,8%,4%,7%,"Explanation:
Although the features in the vignette could be explained by hepatic veno-occlusive disease as well, small bowel wall thickening is more commonly associated with graft vs Host disease. Furthermore, veno-occlusive disease develops within the first 20-30 days following transplantation however graft vs host disease occurs after 3-12 months following transplantation.
Graft vs Host disease
When T-cells from the donor bone marrow attack epithelial cells in the recipient a phenomenon known as Graft versus Host disease can occur. Within the liver this can lead to fibrosis and can present in a similar manner to veno-occlusive disease. The effects are classically seen in the GI tract and the skin as opposed to the lungs but pulmonary manifestations can arise a few months after the transplant. On CT there is mild perihilar fibrosis with nodule formation.",FALSE,"I chose 2. Hepatic Veno-Occlusive Disease (VOD) as the most likely explanation because it is a common complication of stem cell transplants. VOD is caused by the destruction of the small hepatic veins due to the toxic effects of chemotherapy and radiation therapy.

14292,205825,A 64-year-old man is brought to the Emergency Department by his worried wife after becoming unwell at home.

Which of the following is most consistent with multiple sclerosis? Select ONE answer only.,SBA: Central Nervous and Head & Neck,"High T2 signal affecting 1-2 vertebral levels, grey matter involved, mild cord expansion","Low T2 signal affecting 1-2 vertebral levels, grey matter involved, no cord expansion","High T2 signal affecting 1-2 vertebral levels, grey matter spared, gross cord expansion","Low T2 signal affecting 3-4 vertebral levels, grey matter spared, cord expansion","Low T2 signal affecting 3-4 vertebral levels, grey matter involved, no cord expansion",A,69%,5%,22%,2%,2%,"Explanation:
  In general cord expansion is far more of a prominent feature in acute idiopathic transverse myelitis than MS however it can occur with MS, and it’s presence should certainly not exclude MS as a differential diagnosis.
    Demyelination
Demyelination can occur due to multiple sclerosis, ADEM or as an idiopathic process.
Acute idiopathic transverse myelitis is a specific diagnosis of exclusion. There is inflammation of the spinal cord leading to bilateral motor, sensory and autonomic dysfunction. On imaging there is expansion of the central portion of the cord extending over multiple vertebral levels. The inflamed portion returns high signal on T2 weighted sequences. This occurs most commonly in the thoracic spine and importantly, should involve at least two thirds of the cross-sectional area of the cord at the affected level. This is in contrast to a multiple sclerosis plaque which involves under half of the cross-sectional area of the cord.
Multiple sclerosis can affect the spinal cord. Lesions tend to be smaller usually confined to 1-2 vertebral levels and affecting less than half of the cross-sectional area of the cord. There may be mild focal expansion of the cord, but this is a far less prominent feature than it is with idiopathic transverse myelitis. 90% of patients will have other intracranial lesions. The lesions of MS also return high T2 signal, like their intracranial counterparts. The cervical cord is most commonly affected. Gray matter can be affected (particularly in the spine) but it is white matter plaques which are by far the dominant feature. 
ADEM (acute disseminated encephalomyelitis) is an autoimmune condition which occurs days-weeks following a viral infection. It largely affects the white matter of the brain, but the spinal cord can also be affected. Gray matter, particularly the basal ganglia are also often involved. It can occur at any age, but it is usually young children who are affected. Patients usually respond very well to steroid therapy and fortunately, most (90%) cases resolve without any residual deficit. On imaging, the affected areas return high T2 signal.",FALSE,"Low T2 signal affecting 3-4 vertebral levels, grey matter involved, no cord expansion is the most consistent with multiple sclerosis. This is because multiple sclerosis is an autoimmune disorder of the central nervous system that affects the myelin sheath of the neurons. This results in a low T2 signal on MRI, which is seen in multiple sclerosis lesions. Furthermore, these lesions typically affect 3-4 vertebral levels, involve the grey matter, and do not cause cord expansion.",2,,A,FALSE,,C,FALSE,D
11476,205825,"A 68-year-old lady from South Africa complains to her GP of new haematuria. She undergoes an abdominal x-ray which shows thin curvilinear calcification outlining the bladder, with further calcification of the distal ureters also evident. An IVU shows a filling defect on the posterior wall of the bladder which corresponds well with discontinuity in the calcification seen on x-ray. What is the most likely diagnosis?","SBA: Genito urinary, Adrenal, Obstetrics & Gynaecology and Breast",Schistosomiasis,Tuberculosis,Xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis,Malakoplakia,Leukoplakia,A,90%,5%,0%,2%,2%,"Explanation:
Schistosomiasis
Schistosoma larvae burrow through human skin and travel via the lymphatics to the lungs and liver to mature. Thence they continue onto the pelvic vessels where eggs are deposited in the bladder wall. There the eggs cause both a granulomatous and an inflammatory reaction which erodes through the bladder mucosa and the eggs are then excreted in the urine. The disease is endemic to many parts of Africa.
The dominant imaging feature is of bladder wall calcification. This is usually described as curvilinear or floccular and involves all of the layers of the bladder. Owing to the chronic fibrotic reaction the bladder eventually becomes restricted and small; thus the standout imaging feature is of a small calcified bladder. The main differential diagnosis of bladder wall calcification is tuberculosis.
Another important facet to these cases is the risk of bladder cancer developing in the context of chronic inflammation. These cancers are squamous cell carcinomas and should be actively looked for in cases of schistosomiasis; there is a latent period of approximately 20 years prior to development.
  Renal tuberculosis
In areas of the world endemic to tuberculosis, renal tuberculosis is a reasonably common presentation of extra-pulmonary disease. The appearances on imaging vary depending on the disease timeline. The classical ‘putty kidney’ of renal tuberculosis is an end-stage appearance where there is dystrophic calcification affecting all parts of the kidney. At this point the kidney has usually become shrunken and small and the final appearance is of so-called autonephrectomy when there is essentially no parenchymal tissue left, just amorphous calcification. An earlier manifestation is stenosis to the infundibuli connecting the calyces to the renal pelvis causing proximal dilatation of the calyces which are seen to be clubbed on a urogram. Purportedly, the earliest sign is of moth-eaten calyces owing to uneven erosion to the papillae.
  Xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis (XGP)
This curious condition results from chronic pyelonephritis and leads to a non-functioning kidney. Chronic infection (most commonly with Proteus or e-coli) induces a granulomatous process whereby the renal tissue eventually becomes replaced by a mass of reactive tissue. Since proteus infection is one of the main causes it is not surprising that many cases present with a staghorn calculus. The exact association varies from 30-90% depending on the data source. The other finding on CT is of multiple low attenuation rounded areas with Hounsfield Units (HU) of around -15 to -20. These are the dilated calyces filled with debris and xanthoma collections and they cause the whole kidney to be enlarged. The appearance is said to resemble a bear’s paw. Patients can present either on a background of recurrent UTIs or potentially renal colic. Vague malaise and weight loss may be the presentation in the absence of direct urinary symptoms.
  Malakoplakia
Directly translated from Greek, malakoplakia just means soft plaques. These are actually submucosal inflammatory plaques consisting of basophilic PAS positive inclusion bodies and incompletely destroyed e-coli bacteria. The giveaway pathological term is Michaelis-Gutmann inclusion bodies which are the incompletely destroyed e-coli bacteria surrounded by a lipoprotein membrane. Although malakoplakia can occur in anyone, patients with diabetes mellitus or immunosuppression are predisposed to it. Importantly though, it is not a pre-malignant condition unlike leukoplakia. On imaging there are filling defects in the bladder and distal ureters. These are usually small, measuring only a few millimetres across.
  Leukoplakia 
Directly translated from Greek, leukoplakia just means white plaques. It is a squamous metaplastic condition affecting the transitional cell epithelium of the bladder. Presentation is usually as a consequence either of recurrent urinary tract infections or urinary tract calculi. Sometimes patients complain of passing flaky white tissue in the urine which is pathognomonic for this condition. On imaging there is mucosal thickening and filling defects within the bladder. Some sources consider leukoplakia to be a premalignant condition for epidermoid carcinoma.",FALSE,"Malakoplakia is a rare inflammatory disorder of the urinary tract that is characterized by the presence of Michaelis-Gutmann bodies, which are basophilic, laminated, periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) positive structures that are seen on histological examination. The presence of thin curvilinear calcification on x-ray and a filling defect on IVU, which corresponds to the calcification, are characteristic of malakoplakia and make it the most likely diagnosis.",2,,D,TRUE,,A,FALSE,D

Brown-Sequard syndrome
This is a specific finding where damage to the dorsal columns leads to ipsilateral loss of touch sensation and contralateral loss of pain and temperature sensation due to damage to the lateral spinothalamic tracts (contralateral since these ascend after having crossed). There is also ipsilateral motor function loss.
  Causes of Brown-Sequard syndrome
Traumatic:
Penetrating injury
Mechanical trauma e.g. RTA
Iatrogenic injury
Compression e.g. disc herniation
Spinal cord tumour
  Vascular:
Aortic aneurysm repair complication
Vertebral artery dissection
Spinal cord haemorrhage
  Spinal cord infarction
The vascular supply to the spinal cord is derived largely from the vertebral arteries or intercostal arteries with one longitudinal running anterior spinal cord artery and two small longitudinally running posterior spinal cord arteries.
The artery of Adamkiewicz is a particularly large segmental artery supplying the anterior spinal artery from around the level of T9. It is responsible for most of the spinal cord blood supply for the lumbar spinal cord. Damage during aortic surgery or trauma can result in spinal cord infarction.
Usually any vascular insult results in a reasonably rapid onset of symptoms. Spinal cord infarctions are no exception. Often more than one vertebral level is affected.
An MRI will showT2 hyperintensity of at least the central grey matter (if not the whole cross-section of the cord) due to oedema. As with intracranial infarctions there will be restriction of diffusion on the DWI sequences.
Particularly in the thoracic spine, the adjacent vertebral body may also lose its blood supply and undergo infarction.
  Demyelination
Acute idiopathic transverse myelitis is a specific diagnosis of exclusion however. On imaging there is expansion of the central portion of the cord extending over multiple vertebral levels.
Multiple sclerosis can affect the spinal cord. Lesions tend to be smaller usually confined to 1-2 vertebral levels and affecting less than half of the cross-sectional area of the cord.
Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis) largely affects the white matter of the brain but the spinal cord can also be affected. On imaging, the affected areas return high T2 signal and there is characteristic sparing of the grey matter.
  Spondylitis
Infection of the spine, termed spondylitis, is usually considered as either pyogenic or tuberculous (with a couple of notable exceptions). There is some overlap in the features of the two:
Tuberculous spondylodiscitis Staphylococcal spondylodiscitis
Calcification (almost pathognomonic) No calcification
Involvement of the posterior elements Posterior elements spared
Insidious onset More acute onset
Less loss of disc space More loss of disc space
Gibbus deformity (angular kyphosis) No gibbus deformity
Multiple levels involved One level involved
  Lateral Medullary Syndrome (Wallenburg syndrome)
This is caused by either a vertebral artery occlusion or PICA occlusion and is one of those syndromes that is far more common in exams than in real life.
  Subacute combined degeneration
On an MRI scan there will be (if the resolution allows), a longitudinal line of high T2 signal within the cord on sagittal sequences, and often a characteristic 'inverted-V' shape of high T2 signal on axial sequences. In some cases, the 'V' is clearly seen and in others it is harder to appreciate, and the finding is more of high T2 signal bilaterally and symmetrically in the region of the posterior columns.
 ",FALSE,"The most likely diagnosis in this case is lateral medullary syndrome, also known as Wallenberg Syndrome. This is a neurological condition caused by a stroke in the lateral medulla of the brainstem, which can cause symptoms such as loss of power and sensation below T7 on the left, with pain and temperature loss on the contralateral side.

Select ONE answer only.,SBA: Musculoskeletal and Trauma,Acetabular retroversion,Acetabular anteversion,Femoral anteversion,Femoral retroversion,Acetabular retrotorsion,A,56%,14%,9%,16%,6%,"Explanation:
Femoroacetabular impingement (FAI)
Mixed type - >80% of patients have components of both cam-type and pincer-type FAI.
Cam type - a cam is an engineering term for an oval/egg shaped component with a hole through the middle of the wider end. In cam type FAI the femoral head takes on a 'cam' shaped appearance due to bony overgrowth at the superior aspect of the femoral neck. This abnormal bony contour impinges against the anterosuperior aspect of the acetabulum during movement. The condition occurs more frequently in men and tends to affect men in their 30s. Certain conditions can predispose to cam-type FAI, including SUFE, DDH and Perthes disease. Some patients with cam-type FAI exhibit femoral retroversion.
Pincer type - here bony protuberance of the anterosuperior acetabulum causes over-coverage of the femoral head and impingement against the femoral neck. Protrusio acetabuli predisposes to pincer-type FAI. The relationship of the overgrown anterior acetabular rim to the posterior acetabular rim in pincer-type FAI is called acetabular retroversion since it causes the femoral neck to twist posteriorly. Patients usually stand with their toes pointing outwards as a consequence. The condition is more common in women and a patient is typically aged around 40.",TRUE,"Acetabular retroversion is a common finding in patients with pincer-type femoroacetabular impingement. It is characterized by an increased angle between the acetabulum and the femoral head, which can lead to compression of the femoral head against the acetabulum, resulting in pain and discomfort.

The trachea marks the start of the tracheobronchial tree, arising at the lower border of the cricoid cartilage, as a continuation of the larynx. This is at the C6 vertebral level.
It travels inferiorly into the superior mediastinum, bifurcating at the level of the sternal angle to form the right and left bronchi. Inside the trachea, at the T5 vertebral level, there is a cartilaginous ridge called the carina of trachea that marks the point of bifurcation. During its descent the trachea is located anterior to the oesophagus and inclines slightly to the right.
Below the cricoid cartilage there are 15 to 20 incomplete C-shaped tracheal rings (tracheal cartilages), which are composed of hyaline cartilage, and serve to reinforce the front and sides of the trachea to protect and maintain the airway. The free ends of these rings are supported by the trachealis muscle.
The trachea and bronchi are lined by ciliated pseudostratified columnar epithelium, interspersed by goblet cells, which produce mucous. The combination of sweeping movements by the cilia and mucous from the goblet cells forms the functional mucociliary escalator, that traps particles and pathogens and moves them up and out of the airways to be swallowed and destroyed.

This question refers to rounded pneumonia. Rounded pneumonia is common in children less than 8 years old and S. Pneumoniae is the usual causative organism. This is by far the commonest cause of a rounded density, much more so than malignancy, and therefore a follow-up chest radiograph is the most appropriate next investigation.
Rounded pneumonia commonly occurs in the posterior lower zones. Perihilar and peribronchial density is the most common finding with infection in children (particularly viral).
There is mounting evidence that, if responding appropriately to antibiotic therapy, a child with a round pneumonia should not undergo follow up imaging for the sake of follow up itself. However, since 'no further imaging' is not given as an option here, the next most appropriate imaging is a follow-up chest radiograph rather than cross-sectional imaging.",FALSE,"CT chest with arterial contrast is the most appropriate next investigation because it will provide the most detailed information about the lesion.

The left gonadal vein drains into the left renal vein. The pressure in the left renal vein can be higher than it is in the right renal vein since the left renal vein courses between the aorta and the superior mesenteric artery ('the nutcracker effect'). For this reason, isolated left sided varicoceles are extremely common and require no further follow up.
The right gonadal vein usually drains into the IVC. In theory a right renal tumour causing tumour thrombus, or a retroperitoneal mass causing IVC compression, can give rise to an isolated right sided varicocele and it is for this reason that a renal ultrasound scan should be performed if a unilateral right sided varicocele is discovered.
This finding is particularly pertinent for older patients since renal lesions are far less likely in younger patients and rare retroperitoneal lesions are more likely to present in other ways than this.
Overall, although there is much to be discussed on this topic, the underlying principle is that patients with a right sided varicocele should receive a renal ultrasound scan to exclude the presence of a large renal cancer-causing tumour thrombus in the IVC.",FALSE,"This answer is correct because a varicocele is a common, benign condition that does not usually require follow-up or treatment.

13913,205825,A 70-year-old man much troubled by tinnitus undergoes an MRI scan of the base of his skull. The ossicles are disrupted by a middle ear mass which is bulging the tympanic membrane. It is high in signal on T1 and T2 weighted sequences. What is the most likely diagnosis? Select ONE answer only.,SBA: Central Nervous and Head & Neck,Cholesterol granuloma,Acquired cholesteatoma,Aberrant internal carotid artery,Granulation tissue,Otitis media,A,77%,16%,4%,2%,2%,"Explanation:
Cholesterol granuloma
A cholesterol granuloma occurs as a sequela of recurrent bouts of otitis media. Haemorrhage within the middle ear leads to the formation of granulation tissue. On imaging this is seen as non-specification of the middle ear on CT. Bony changes can occur chronically with bony expansion, or displacement and even destruction of the ossicles. The signals characteristics on MRI are therefore important to distinguish it from a cholesteatoma. Whereas a cholesteatoma on MRI is isointense to brain parenchyma on T1, a cholesterol granuloma will show high signal in the middle ear on T1 due to the paramagnetic effects of methaemoglobin. On clinical examination the ENT surgeon may report a bulging blue tympanic membrane. This is classical. Dehiscence of the jugular bulb is an important differential diagnosis to exclude as this will also give a blue tympanic membrane on examination but the management is radically different!
  Cholesteatoma
Cholesteatomas (Acquired or congenital) are histolologically epidermoid cysts. On imaging the finding of non-dependant soft tissue and bony erosion within the middle ear is typical for a cholesteatoma.
There are two types of acquired cholesteatoma:
Pars flaccida (80%) – classically erodes the scutum and extends superiorly
Pars tensa (20%) – classically erodes the ossicles, extending medially
  These refer to the two parts of the tympanic membrane from which they arise.
  Image © Medical Exam Prep
  In due course, if left unattended, a cholesteatoma will expand to fill the entire middle ear. Prior to this point they can be seen as non-dependant soft tissue within the middle ear. Dependant soft tissue within the middle ear suggests the presence of fluid or pus and the diagnosis of a middle ear infection. Once a cholesteatoma has filled the middle ear completely however no gas remains from which to discern dependency.
There are a number of theories as to how cholesteatomas arise. One theory is that following a perforation of the tympanic membrane entry of desquamated stratified keratinised squamous epithelium from the external auditory canal into the middle ear is permitted. There it adheres to the tympanic membrane and proliferates unrelentingly causing a soft tissue mass to form and eventually leading to bony erosion of the ossicles, scutum and/or other parts of the middle ear.
A congenital cholesteatoma behaves in a similar manner but is present from birth due to an aberrant location of a tiny island of keratinised squamous epithelium.
Cholesteatomas are difficult to manage as they have a high recurrence rate. Imaging has a significant role to play in the management of recurrent cholesteatomas; distinguishing recurrence from post-operative granulation tissue or fluid is important.
  Diagnosis Restricts Diffusion Enhances
Recurrent cholesteatoma Yes No
Granulation tissue No Yes
Fluid No No
  Post-contrast sequences for recurrent cholesteatomas require a delay of around 45 minutes from giving the contrast to acquiring images as the granulation tissue is slow to take up contrast. This has obvious down-sides to any modern day busy MRI schedule. However since the management of post-operative granulation tissue and post-operative fluid is largely identical, namely expectant, it is not important to differentiate the one from the other. Thus findings on diffusion weighted sequences are the most important thing in post-operative cholesteatoma imaging.
  Aberrant internal carotid artery
An aberrant internal carotid artery can cause a pulsatile mass in the middle ear. The question usually asked on this topic is slightly different and to do with the persistent stapedial artery and consequential aplastic foramen spinosum (anatomically – ‘the heel of the high-heeled shoe’). The stapedial artery in such cases arises from the internal carotid artery and runs through the stapes, becoming the middle meningeal artery (which usually arises from the external carotid artery and courses through the foramen spinosum).",FALSE,"The most likely diagnosis in this case is acquired cholesteatoma, because it is the most common cause of middle ear masses that can disrupt the ossicles and bulge the tympanic membrane. Cholesteatomas are characterized by high signal on T1 and T2 weighted sequences, which is consistent with what is seen in the MRI scan.",2,,B,FALSE,,B,FALSE,E

Image © Medical Exam Prep
    Pelvic lipomatosis
This is a curious condition which arises in young-middle aged adults. There is significant overgrowth of fat cells within the pelvis which can lead to compression of all or any of the pelvic structures. The bladder becomes pear shaped as the main volume is pulled superiorly. Similarly, the sigmoid is elevated out of the pelvis and the rectum straightened to its shortest path. On CT there is a striking amount of low attenuation fat within the pelvis and similarly this will be seen as high T1 signal on MRI.
  A tailgut duplication cyst (retrorectal cystic hamartoma)
Curiously these occur almost exclusively in women. Anatomically they sit within the presacral or retrorectal fat. They tend to be an incidental diagnosis and can be associated with bony defects within the sacrum. Since they usually contain mucein they appear characteristically high in signal on T1 weighted MRI sequences. They can be surprisingly large and are often multiloculated.
  A Tarlov cyst
A Tarlov cyst is the name given to dilatation of the posterior nerve root sheath. They follow CSF on all sequences and can cause significant bony scalloping.
  Liposarcoma
It would not be possible to diagnose this on the basis of a barium enema. It would be a differential diagnosis for pelvic lipomatosis as seen on CT but usually contain a variable degree of soft tissue attenuation whereas the only soft tissue attenuation seen with pelvic lipomatosis results from anatomical distortion of normal structures.
  Ulcerative colitis

Static blood within the sagittal sinus gives rise to high signal on T1. Normally the sagittal sinus will appear as a flow void on T1w.
The empty delta sign is traditionally a post-contrast CT finding although the same appearance can also be seen on post-contrast T1 sequences. Bilateral haemorrhages can be a secondary consequence to a sagittal sinus thrombosis which may point towards the diagnosis but the thrombosis itself is recognised by the empty delta sign on post-contrast CT.
Dense triangle sign pertains to the acute thrombus as it appears on an unenhanced CT scan.
The associated infarctions can often be haemorrhagic and parasagittal haemorrhages are very specific for a sagittal sinus thrombosis but subarachnoid haemorrhage is not likely to be related.",FALSE,"The Empty Delta Sign is a classic finding on a non-contrast MRI scan of the head in a patient with cerebral infarctions.

For a patient to develop gynaecomastia as a consequence of testicular cancer the tumour must be oestrogenic. Sex cord stromal tumours can produce oestrogen and present in this way, as can germ cell tumours. The classical tumour to be linked with gynaecomastia as an index presentation is the sex cord tumour Leydig cell tumours since around a third of cases present as gynaecomastia. That being said, when tumour incidence is accounted for, technically more patients who present with gynaecomastia will actually have a germ cell tumour of either a seminomatous or non-seminomatous variety.

Sertoli cell tumours - These are much less common, less likely to produce hormones and therefore gynaecomastia but can be associated with syndromes such as Peutz-Jegher syndrome, or the Carney complex. They classically arise in young boys but are by no means rare at all any age.
  Carney Triad
Carney complex
Pulmonary chondromas
Atrial myxoma
Gastric leiomyosarcoma (GIST)
Facial/buccal pigmentation
Extra-adrenal paraganglioma
Sertoli tumour of the testis
  Pituitary adenoma
  Germ cell tumours
Germ cell tumours are divided into seminomas and non-seminomatous varieties. They are very common and comprise almost half of all testicular tumours. They can often be found incidentally or subsequent to any trauma which might cause the patient to self-examine and discover a testicular lump. Alternatively they can present as a vague dull scrotal aching sensation with no lump.
Lymphatic drainage is to the retroperitoneum. Para-aortic lymph nodes are therefore regional. Involvement of the internal, external and common iliac nodes however, is considered non-regional. Only if there has been previous scrotal or inguinal surgery disrupting tissue planes are inguinal or external iliac artery nodes considered regional.
They typically are found in patients in their 40s. Testicular tumours can be diagnosed with a strong pre-test probability based solely on age as detailed in the table below. On ultrasound there will be an intratesticular low reflectivity well-defined mass. Colour doppler flow can be seen within the mass.

Select ONE answer only.,SBA: Musculoskeletal and Trauma,Bilateral pars defects,Degenerative changes,Transitional vertebra,Scheuermann disease,Osteoblastoma,A,80%,15%,3%,2%,0%,"Explanation:
Spondylolysis
Anterolisthesis of L5 over S1 with normal spinous process alignment is typical for bilateral pars defects, also known as spondylolysis. The pars is the junction of the spinous lamina, pedicle and facet. A bony defect in the pars interarticularis allows separation of the spinous process from the rest of the vertebra, which slips forwards. Patients can be asymptomatic from this or may develop worsening anterolisthesis with consequential nerve root impingement.

If there is a lucent linear defect in the neck of the scottie dog, a pars defect is present.",FALSE,"I chose 1. Degenerative changes as the most likely diagnosis because the x-rays show mild anterolisthesis of L5 on S1, which is a degenerative condition caused by wear and tear on the discs and joints of the spine.

The MAG3 scan will show whether the kidney is truly functionally obstructed.
  MAG3
Dynamic scan. Images every 2 mins for approximately 20 mins
MAG3 is a compound which has a high renal extraction rate and can be labelled with Tc99m. It provides an overview of the renal plasma flow. A normal unobstructed kidney shows an initial increase in activity over 2 minutes as the tracer reaches the kidney followed by a slow decline in activity over around 20 minutes as it is filtered. An obstructed system will show a similar initial increase, but activity will then not decline. Furosemide can be given to maximise the opportunity to show flow distal to the kidney. MAG3 is a safe agent to use in patients with renal failure.
  Captopril (an ACEi) can be given to diagnose renal artery stenosis as a cause of hypertension since the activity in a patient with renal artery stenosis will decline following administration of Captopril whereas a normal kidney will retain activity.
Post-micturition images at 20 minutes can help to show the presence of residual bladder volume.
  DTPA – differential agent
Dynamic scan. Images at 1.5 second intervals for the first 30 seconds then less at 5 min intervals for 30 mins
Since DTPA is cleared only via the glomeruli it can be used to measure GFR. In a normal kidney the activity level peaks sharply followed by a decline which is initially rapid and then tapers off. As GFR worsens firstly the initial rapid decline becomes more gradual and with increasingly poor disease the initial peak then becomes diminished too. Ironically for a study used to measure GFR, DTPA is not a good agent for patients with renal failure; it can only be cleared via the glomeruli therefore if there is no glomerular filtration the agent will persist and lead to a high dose. Studies need higher doses than MAG3.
  DMSA – morphology and structure
Static scan. Image once at 2 hours.
DMSA is an excellent agent for evaluating the renal cortex. It is used a lot in the paediatric setting in the investigation of scars following pyelonephritis.",FALSE,"Technetium-99m DMSA is the best choice to manage this patient because it is a radiopharmaceutical used to evaluate renal function and detect renal parenchymal abnormalities. It can be used to assess the degree of hydronephrosis, detect renal scarring, and evaluate the cause of hydronephrosis. It is also useful in detecting renal stones, which was ruled out by the CT KUB.",2,"3. A question about clinical management, what is the best way to manage this patient?",C,TRUE,,A,TRUE,A

Pedunculated fibroids
  In the world of interventional radiology, uterine fibroid embolisation is gaining momentum. The uterine artery arises from the internal iliac artery whereas the ovarian artery arises directly from the aorta and has a corkscrew appearance on angiography. Anastomoses between the two arteries or the two sides exist in approximately 20% of patients. Patients should be counselled for the risk of ovarian dysfunction subsequent to the procedure and patients over the age of 45 are at particular risk. Pedunculated fibroids are said to be poor candidates for embolisation owing to their propensity to detach however the literature is slightly contradictory on this topic.",FALSE,"I chose this answer because a dominant fibroid of 20 cm is too large to be treated with uterine fibroid embolisation. Uterine fibroid embolisation is generally reserved for smaller fibroids, typically those measuring less than 10 cm.

While lower limb angiography is usually the preserve of the vascular radiologist a basic grounding in CT angiography is essential for the general radiologist.
The arteries of a diabetic typically become small and calcified. In the lower leg the normal three vessel run-off can be reduced to two or even single vessel run-off causing arterial supply problems downstream.
Another aspect which could be asked, would be the best method of imaging the vessels of a patient with an eGFR precluding the use of nephrotoxic contrast agents. In such settings diagnostic images can be acquired with CO2 angiography.",TRUE,"The most likely findings from a CT angiogram in a 76-year-old man with type 2 diabetes and a non-healing ulcer to his left heel would be 2, 3, and 4. Small and calcified peripheral vessels (1) can occur in patients with diabetes, but are not necessarily the most likely findings in this case. Multiple venous collaterals (5) are also not likely to be seen on a CT angiogram. The most likely findings would be a chronic occlusion to the left superficial femoral artery (2), an acute occlusion to the left popliteal artery (3), and extensive bilateral aorto-iliac disease (4).

11606,205825,A 63-year-old lady develops progressive abdominal distension accompanied by vague abdominal pains. An ultrasound shows a 20cm complex ovarian mass and her ca-125 level is found to be markedly elevated. She undergoes a CT scan for staging and widespread disease is discovered. Which of the following is least likely to be secondary to metastatic ovarian cancer?,"SBA: Genito urinary, Adrenal, Obstetrics & Gynaecology and Breast",Small bowel obstruction,Sclerotic bone lesions,Left pleural effusion,Ascites,Peritoneal soft tissue deposit,B,11%,76%,9%,1%,3%,"Explanation:
Bony involvement in metastatic ovarian cancer is actually relatively uncommon with only around 2% of patients being affected.
Ovarian cancer can spread in a multitude of ways:
  Spread of ovarian cancer
Direct extension
Sigmoid mesocolon, broad ligament, fallopian tubes
Intraperitoneal seeding and implantation
Omental caking, peritoneal space
Lymphatic spread
External iliac, obturator nodes
Haematogenous
Liver, lung, adrenal glands, pleural effusion
  Bowel obstruction is relatively common cause of morbidity and mortality with disseminated ovarian cancer.
  Ovarian cancer
There are a number of different types of ovarian carcinoma and the final diagnosis will be a histological one. On imaging the features can be varied.
  Subtypes
Frequency and age
Malignant epithelial tumours (Serous, mucinous, endometroid, clear cell)
85%   60s -70s
Malignant germ cell tumours (Teratoma, dysgerminaoma, choricarcinoma, mixed)
7%   <30 years
Metastases
<10%
Sex cord stromal tumours
~5%
  A number of factors increase the risk of developing ovarian cancer in an individual. Anything which increases the number of ovulatory cycles a woman undergoes in her lifetime will increase the risk of ovarian cancer (early menarche, late menopause, nulliparity), and vice versa (multiparity, breastfeeding, oral contraceptive pill use). A family history of related cancers also increase the risk.
  Presenting symptoms may be quite vague with abdominal pains, constipation or urinary frequency being the only complaints if any from the patient. Consequently many tumours have already spread beyond the ovary by the time of diagnosis. Initial investigation is often with ultrasound. Although ovarian cancers can have a variety of imaging appearances, solid or papillary components to a cystic mass are strongly indicative of malignancy. Predominantly solid masses with some small cystic components are also likely to be malignant but completely perfectly solid lesions are actually more likely to be benign. Ovarian fibromas and fibrothecomas are both benign lesions which can be seen as solid masses however despite this, without prior imaging for comparison a solid ovarian lesion is malignant until proven otherwise.
  Ovarian cysts
The incidental finding of a simple (non-haemorrhagic) ovarian cyst in day to day cross-sectional reporting is a relatively common occurrence. In deciding on a subsequent management plan both age and the size of the cyst should be taken into account as well as the presence of any internal haemorrhage, thus:
  Age
Diameter
Plan
Reproductive age
<3cm
Normal finding, no follow up
3-5cm
Almost certainly benign, no follow up
5-7cm
Almost certainly benign but risk of torsion. Follow up with ultrasound either at 2-6 months if uncertainty of findings, or at 6-12 months. 
>7cm
Difficult to fully evaluate on ultrasound, suggest MRI
Haemorrhagic, >5cm
Follow up ultrasound or MRI in 6 weeks (different part of the menstrual cycle)
Post-menopausal
<1cm
No follow up
1-3 cm
Describe but no follow up needed.
3-5 cm
Follow up with ultrasound either at 3-6 months if uncertainty of findings, or at 6-12 months. 
Haemorrhagic, any size
Follow up ultrasound or MRI in 6 weeks
  In summary if a cyst is above 7cm in diameter an MRI is warranted even though the likelihood of benignity is still extremely high.",FALSE,"Metastatic ovarian cancer is most likely to spread to organs in the abdominal cavity such as the intestines, liver, and peritoneum. It is much less likely to spread to the pleura, which is the lining of the lungs.

12421,205825,80-year-old man is found to have a mass involving the corpus callosum. Broadly speaking the mass is low on T1 and high on T2. There is evidence of central necrosis and T2 changes in periventricular regions. What is the most likely diagnosis?,SBA: Central Nervous and Head & Neck,Glioblastoma multiforme,Lymphoma,Anaplastic astrocytoma,Gliomatosis cerebri,Progressive multifocal leucencephalopathy,A,82%,11%,3%,3%,1%,"Explanation:
There is a defined differential for ‘lesions which cross the corpus callosum’: GBM, lymphoma, infarction, trauma, radiation, metastases, MS. Although not well described here the ‘T2 changes’ could be oedema relating to the mass.
PML (progressive multifocal leucoencephalopathy) is an HIV related condition caused by the JC virus which is classically described as having asymmetrical high T2 signal but there isn’t anything else in the question which points to this.
Gliomatosis cerebri is a horrible tumour seen as generalised high T2 signal involving at least three lobes but is usually found in younger patients than this.
An anaplastic astrocytoma is a main player in the differential diagnosis for ‘lesions which cross the corpus callosum’ but is more prevalent in younger or middle aged patients.
Thus the answer for this question comes down to lymphoma or GBM. Both can be low on T1 and high on T2 but central necrosis is a classical finding in GBM and there is often significant oedema.",TRUE,"Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most likely diagnosis because it is the most aggressive form of brain cancer and is characterized by a high T2 signal on imaging with central necrosis and T2 changes in the periventricular regions. GBM is often found in elderly patients, making it the most likely diagnosis in this case.",2,,A,TRUE,,A,FALSE,D
9286,205825,A 45-year-old man has a CT scan of his pelvis following a motorbiking accident. There are no findings of major trauma but there is a 10cm mass in the pelvis sitting just superior to the bladder.  It is smooth in outline and homogenous in density showing slightly more contrast enhancement than the adjacent psoas muscles. The vessels supplying it course upwards into the abdomen and out of the field of view. Which of the following would be the best way of confirming the diagnosis?,SBA: Gastrointestinal,99mTc – Sulphur colloid scan,MRI,Ultrasound,99mTc – DTPA scan,99mTc – DMSA scan,A,69%,17%,7%,4%,4%,"Explanation:
Splenic variants
Rarely (<1% of patients) the spleen can migrate from its usual position and end up virtually anywhere else within the abdominal cavity. This is of no clinical consequence unless the consequently long and tortuous vessels supplying it become compromised by torsion or the patient undergoes abdominal surgery. On imaging the wandered spleen should exhibit the usual characteristics of a normally positioned spleen but if there is any doubt as to the diagnosis confirmation with a 99mTc-sulphur-colloid scan can be sought.
Accessory spleens or splenunculi are relatively common (30% of patients) and can usually be found close to the splenic hilum or tail of the pancreas. They follow the spleen on all modalities and should not be mistaken for intra-abdominal lymph nodes.
Polysplenia is a condition which arises as part of left-sided isomerism (also known as heterotaxy). In Left-sided isomerism all of the features which would usually be found on the left side of the body are found on both, or right sided features are found on the left side (such as the liver). Vice versa is true for right-sided isomerism. Right-sided isomerism usually presents earlier on due to the greater complexity of associated cardiac abnormalities.

12341,205825,A 78-year-old man undergoes an MRI after a routine asymptomatic screening ear exam shows an intact blue tympanic membrane.

What is the most likely diagnosis?,SBA: Central Nervous and Head & Neck,Cholesterol granuloma,Glomus tumour,Cholesteatoma,Aberrant internal carotid artery,Haemangioma,A,80%,9%,5%,2%,3%,"Explanation:
A cholesterol granuloma should be at the top of the list when a blue tympanic membrane is mentioned. The features described in the question are classical for a cholesterol granuloma – the other notable feature not provided is the absence of pulsatile tinnitus which helps distinguish it from a glomus tympanicum. A cholesterol granuloma contains both cholesterol crystals and blood products (hence is bright on T1) whereas a cholesteatoma is isointense to brain parenchyma on T1 and can apparently be seen clinically as a whitish mass behind the tympanic membrane.
An aberrant internal carotid artery can cause a pulsatile mass in the middle ear. The question usually asked on this topic is slightly different and to do with the persistent stapedial artery and consequential aplastic foramen spinosum (anatomically – ‘the heel of the high-heeled shoe’). The stapedial artery in such cases arises from the internal carotid artery and runs through the stapes, becoming the middle meningeal artery (which usually arises from the external carotid artery and courses through the foramen spinosum).
Haemangiomas of the middle ear have been described but are largely confined to case reports in the literature.",FALSE,"The most likely diagnosis for a homogeneously high middle ear mass on T1 and T2 MRI is a glomus tumour.

A mucinous carcinoma is a subtype of infiltrating/invasive ductal carcinoma. The ultrasound findings are those of many other suspicious lesions too however mucinous carcinoma is the only one which would fit best. Differentiating this from a different type of carcinoma would be difficult.
A phyllodes tumour would usually appear as a lobulated round hypoechoic mass with ill-defined borders and a posterior acoustic enhancement.
A fibroadenoma would be typically in a younger patient in their 20-30s. These are largely hypoechoic with a range of additional features but can have an echogenic halo.

Please note the question asks for the LEAST likely answer.
Retraction of the liver capsule signifies the presence of fibrosis.

Cholangiocarcinoma
Fibrolamella HCC
Metastases (breast, lung, carcinoid, colorectal)
IgG4 related disease
Iatrogenic/ post-traumatic
Cirrhosis
  Focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH)
These lesions typically occur in women in late middle age. They are not caused by oral contraceptive use however they do enlarge in response to hormone stimulation. They are composed of hyperplastic hepatocytes and are thought to arise when a small underlying congenital vascular malformation means that an area of the liver receives a better blood supply and therefore grows better, thus they lack a true capsule but can outgrow their blood supply resulting in the classical central fibrous scar which is present in around half of cases. On imaging they do demonstrate mass effect, displacing adjacent vessels, have marked arterial enhancement which fits in with their supposed aetiology. The central scar enhances only on delayed sequences. On MRI they tend to return high signal on T2 weighted sequences. Their appearance on contrast enhanced ultrasound is interesting; the central scar enhances very early in the arterial phase, branching out in a spoke-wheel type of appearance. During the main arterial phase, the lesions enhance strongly before becoming isoechoic in the portal venous phase.",FALSE,"I chose Fibrolamellar HCC as the least likely diagnosis because it is an uncommon form of liver cancer that typically affects young adults and adolescents, whereas the patient in this case is 54 years old. Additionally, it is a type of cancer that is not typically associated with inwards retraction of the liver capsule.

Where it the new lesion likely to be?,SBA: Central Nervous and Head & Neck,Callososeptal interface,Cortical,Basal ganglia,Thalamus,Virchow-Robins space,A,75%,13%,3%,8%,2%,"Explanation:
Basal ganglia lesions will likely lead to movement or coordination issues, or spasms.
Lesions of the thalami may be purely sensory or lead to ataxia. This is arguably an alternative answer however the callosoeptal interface is far more classical for multiple sclerosis.
Virchow-Robin spaces are dilated fluid filled spaces surrounding perforating vessels and are a differential diagnosis for multiple sclerosis however will suppress on FLAIR sequences.
  Multiple sclerosis
The imaging characteristics of multiple sclerosis should definitely be learnt, as much for real life radiology as for the exams. This is an idiopathic demyelinating disease with oedematous perivascular inflammation in the acute stage progressing to demyelination with proliferation of the astroglia in the chronic phase. There are oblong elliptical plaques of high T2 signal at the callososeptal interface.
Other highly testable features:
Involvement of the middle cerebellar peduncle is specific to multiple sclerosis when attempting to differentiate it from small vessel ischaemic changes
Lesions can cross the midline
Axial T2 sequences are better than FLAIR for posterior fossa lesions
Acute lesions can enhance with contrast, classically in an ‘incomplete ring’
Thalamic involvement is rare and suggests the possibility of ADEM instead",FALSE,"The basal ganglia are a group of nuclei located at the base of the brain, and they are responsible for controlling voluntary movement, as well as the regulation of emotions and cognition. Multiple sclerosis can cause inflammation of the white matter in the brain, which can lead to lesions in the basal ganglia.

The spectrum of cardiac carcinoid disease encompasses the physical plaque deposits of metastatic disease as well as the valve damage caused by secretion of vasoactive substances from the tumour load. Classically the right side of the heart is most affected because most of the primary lesions, as well as hepatic metastases, secrete into the right-sided circulation.
Prolapse of a soft tissue density mass through the mitral valve is a classic description for a myxoma however this feature is seen on Ultrasound predominantly, as well as potentially on cardiac MRI.
A low attenuation mass without calcification is probably describing a lipoma.",FALSE,"The correct answer is 1, 3, 4, 5. Cardiac carcinoid tumors are typically associated with left heart dilatation, prolapse of a soft tissue density mass through the mitral valve, low attenuation mass without calcification, right heart dilatation, and biatrial dilatation.

What is the most likely diagnosis?,SBA: Paediatrics,Congenital pulmonary airway malformation,Intralobar sequestration,Extralobar sequestration,Swyer-James syndrome,Bronchogenic cyst,A,77%,12%,3%,3%,6%,"Explanation:
Congenital Pulmonary Airway Malformation (CPAM) – also known as Congenital cystic adenomatoid malformation (CCAM)
Although often an antenatal diagnosis, CPAM should be considered in the investigation of a neonatal respiratory distress. Milder cases can present later when the child develops a LRTI and decompensates. On investigation a cystic mass is discovered. The size of the cysts denotes the type with Type I accounting for half of cases and comprising a smaller number of larger (>20mm) cysts. Type III is more sponge-like with cysts measuring only a couple of mm and Type II is between the two. Where cysts are larger, air-fluid levels may be seen. The malformation can exert a mass effect, causing both hypoplasia of the remainder of the ipsilateral lung as well as contralateral mediastinal shift.
  Swyer-James syndrome
In this condition, normal development of the infant lung is impeded by bronchiolitis (viral or mycoplasma) at an early age, with superadded acute airspace destruction. Consequently the affected lobe is small and lucent on the CXR due to air trapping. It is a differential diagnosis for a unilateral lucent hemithorax, along with a pneumothorax, very large pulmonary emboli and causes of decreased chest wall musculature such as Poland syndrome or, historically, polio. In an an exam situation Swyer-James syndrome is usually given as a teenage or young adult patient with a history of recurrent LRTIs. Air trapping, and bronchiectasis can also be described.
  Bronchopulmonary foregut malformations:
CPAM
Sequestration
Duplication cysts (bronchogenic, neuroenteric, enteric)
  Pulmonary sequestration
There are two types of pulmonary sequestration and two features which unite them. A segment of lung firstly, which derives its arterial blood supply from the systemic circulation and secondly, has no communication with the bronchial tree is termed pulmonary sequestration. It is a congenital abnormality and usually affects the left lower lobe with a smaller percentage affecting the right lower lobe.
Intralobar sequestration – This is more common (75%) but less severe. The affected segment does not have its own pleura and drains, like normal, via the pulmonary veins. Presents as recurrent pneumonias and is seen on a CXR as cysts with fluid levels. Some are associated with other congenital abnormalities but a larger proportion develop in isolation.
Extralobar sequestration – This is less common (25%) and more severe with around half of patients suffering from other additional congenital anomalies. Venous drainage is via the systemic circulation and patients present in childhood either with respiratory distress due to shunting of blood or with symptoms attributed to the associated congenital anomalies (e.g. diaphragmatic hernia). The segment has its own pleura and therefore collateral air drift via the pores of Kohn cannot occur. The lack of aeration helps differentiate it from intralobar sequestration. Seen on a CXR as an opacity adjacent to the heart, abutting the diaphragm.
  Bronchogenic cysts
Unless particularly large, or infected, they are usually an incidental finding. Since they are a malformation of the bronchial tree they are lined with respiratory epithelium and hence fluid filled. They do not however communicate with the bronchial tree and therefore do not usually contain air. On CT they will be seen as a unilocular cyst with HU of water or slightly higher owing to the high protein content of water. Approximately half of cases are adjacent to the carina.",FALSE,"Intralobar sequestration is the most likely diagnosis for a 5-year-old girl with a large multi-cystic mass in the right hemithorax containing air-fluid levels. Intralobar sequestration is a congenital anomaly in which a segment of the lung is separated from the normal pulmonary circulation and is supplied by its own systemic arterial blood supply.

It measures 20HU on the unenhanced sequence, 75HU on the portal venous phase and 38HU on the delayed sequences. You may use a calculator. What is the relative washout of this lesion?","SBA: Genito urinary, Adrenal, Obstetrics & Gynaecology and Breast",49%,67%,73%,47%,32%,A,70%,14%,7%,5%,5%,"Explanation:
Figures have been rounded to the nearest whole number.
Absolute washout = (75-38)/(75-20) = 67%
Relative washout = (75-38)/75 = 49%
    This lesion is a benign adrenal adenoma. In many centres, if the lesion measures less than 10HU on the unenhanced sequence then the study will be terminated at that point.
  Adrenal washout
Washout characteristics of adrenal nodules help confirm or refute a diagnosis of an adrenal adenoma. The absolute washout takes into account the initial uptake of contrast whereas the relative washout calculation is based only on how well contrast washes out of a nodule.
The underpinning principle is that vasculature within malignant lesions is more permeable than in benign lesions. This allows contrast to diffuse out of the lesion during the portal venous phase and the contrast is then slower to wash out during the delayed phase than it would be for benign lesions. Thus the higher/faster washout characteristics (either absolute or relative) the more suggestive it is that a lesion is benign.
    Adrenal adenoma
These present a diagnostic challenge if only to rule out a malignant adrenal mass. Once the diagnosis is confirmed they can then be left alone and do not require any further imaging. The majority are obvious on CT and obviously adenomas. Owing to their high fat content most adenomas show low Hounsfield units (HU) an HU <18 on an unenhanced study has a sensitivity of 85% and a specificity of 100%.
In cases where the fat content is insufficient to make the diagnosis an adrenal protocol CT can be performed. This compares the HU on an unenhanced scan, a portal venous phase scan and a 15 minute delayed phase scan. From these values the absolute washout can be calculated by comparing the difference between the two contrast studies with the amount of contrast taken up in the first place (i.e. the difference between the portal venous phase and the unenhanced phase). The relative washout is calculated by comparing the difference between the two contrast studies to just the portal venous phase (i.e. it is relative to the portal venous phase).
An alternative diagnostic strategy which, but for demand management, is better for patients as far as dose preservation is concerned, is an MRI scan. The fat content of adrenal adenomas shows up well as signal loss on out-of-phase imaging and gives a chemical shift artefact in the frequency encoding direction on both gradient echo and spin echo sequences.  On gradient echo sequences due to the chemical shift a black line appears in all directions and is termed the India Ink effect or etching artefact.
  Diagnostic of adrenal adenoma:

9386,205825,A 32-year-old lady attends A+E having recently arrived back from a holiday in Jamaica. She has abdominal pain and her liver function tests are deranged. An ultrasound scan shows hepatomegaly and the liver is diffusely low in reflectivity. A portal vein Doppler study is normal and there is no ascites. What is the diagnosis?,SBA: Gastrointestinal, Viral hepatitis,Acute Budd-Chiari syndrome,Primary biliary cirrhosis,Passive hepatic congestion,Hepatic veno-occlusive disease,A,70%,3%,1%,3%,22%,"Explanation:
Viral hepatitis
The imaging findings of hepatitis are non-specific and include hepatomegaly, decreased echogenicity, periportal oedema, and gallbladder wall thickening. The ‘starry sky’ appearance is used to describe a liver which has a number of bright echogenic dots on a background of diffuse low reflectivity and this has traditionally been associated with hepatitis however both the sensitivity and specificity of this sign are low.
  Hepatic venous outflow obstruction
There are three separate syndromes which all overlap both in terms of their clinical and radiological features. They are, however, separate entities, caused by subtly different processes.
Passive hepatic congestion – this arises due to a cardiac problem such as right sided heart failure of any cause or constrictive pericarditis. Tender hepatomegaly is common and on imaging the hepatic veins and IVC are notably enlarged.
Budd-Chiari syndrome – the pathology here is within the hepatic veins with thrombosis or other non-thrombotic obstruction (e.g. extrinsic compression). Acutely there is abdominal pain, ascites and hepatomegaly. The presence or absence of caudate lobe hypertrophy can help distinguish between a chronic process or an acute one where this has not had sufficient time to develop.
Hepatic veno-occlusive disease – fibrosis of the tiny venules can develop following a stem-cell transplant, and by pyrrolizidine alkaloids found in Jamaican bush teas. Clinically patients present with weight gain due to fluid retention, hepatomegaly and jaundice.

Comma-shaped collateral vessels – spiders web (chronic feature, also visible on doppler)

  All three cause hepatomegaly and ascites, although fluid overload in general is a particular feature of hepatic veno-occlusive disease. On CT all three can give a ‘nutmeg’ appearance to the liver when, on early phase imaging, contrast has yet to homogenise throughout the liver and consequently there is a mottled appearance which rather resembles the cut surface of a nutmeg. On delayed phase imaging the liver becomes more homogeneous. The flip-flop sign is particularly associated with Budd-Chiari syndrome with strong central and limited peripheral enhancement on early phases followed by early central washout with retained peripheral enhancement on delayed images.
  Budd-Chiari syndrome
The haemodynamics of the liver, as being different from any other organ, can give rise to some interesting pathology. In Budd-Chiari syndrome venous obstruction causes flow reversal in the portal venous system to drain the liver. Acutely this presents as a triad of abdominal pain, ascites and hepatomegaly. In many acute cases the liver function tests have not had sufficient time to become deranged. The caudate lobe usually drains directly into the IVC so may not be affected by the underlying cause of obstruction to the other hepatic veins. Consequently it is able to shoulder more of the usual burden of the liver and becomes hypertrophied. In the acute setting this has not had time to manifest and the caudate lobe will be of a normal size.
Some of the many causes of Budd-Chiari syndrome
Thrombosis of the hepatic veins
Platelets (thrombocytosis)
Pill (OCP)
Pregnancy (hypercoagulable state)
Polycythaemia rubra vera
Non-thrombotic causes
Mechanical compression by a tumour
Right atrial myxoma
Constrictive pericarditis
  On CT the enhancement pattern is described as being ‘flip-flop’, with strong central and limited peripheral enhancement on early phases followed by early central washout with retained peripheral enhancement on delayed images. Alternatively the whole liver may appear mottled with a ‘nutmeg’ type pattern due to the venous congestion. On Doppler ultrasound or MRI the hepatic veins will show a reduction in calibre or not be seen at all and on Doppler insonation the hepatic veins may show little or no flow. Flow in the portal venous system, on the other hand, may be reversed. In chronic cases a veritable spiders-web of small collateral vessels can be seen on angiography; they can also be seen on MRI and are described as having a comma-shape.
  Passive hepatic congestion
This is similar to chronic Budd-Chiari syndrome, but whereas Budd-Chiari syndrome arises due to hepatic outflow obstruction, in heart failure leading to hepatic congestion there is no mechanical obstruction. In contrast to acute thrombotic Budd-Chiari syndrome there is distension of the hepatic veins and IVC, a feature which distinguishes it from hepatic veno-occlusive disease as well. Other signs of heart failure, such as pleural effusions and ascites may be present concurrently.
  Hepatic veno-occlusive disease
The outcome of hepatic veno-occlusive disease is similar to that of Budd-Chiari syndrome but the mechanism is different. Hepatic congestion develops as a consequence of fibrosis to the venules within the liver. This can occur secondary to chemotherapy or bone marrow transplantation and also bizarrely due to pyrrolizidine alkaloids which are found in Jamaican bush teas. On imaging there is overlap with the features of Budd-Chiari syndrome but crucially the hepatic veins should appear normal; it is the smaller venules which cause the problem and these are not seen on ultrasound or CT.
  Primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC)
This can be difficult to distinguish from PSC however whereas PSC can involve both intra and extrahepatic ducts, PBC only involves the intrahepatic ducts. It is an autoimmune condition and, like many other autoimmune conditions, patients are typically women in their middle ages. Antimitochondrial antibodies (AMA) are present in the vast majority of patients. On imaging, the secondary cirrhotic effects are most pertinent with caudate lobe hypertrophy and left lobar atrophy. The periportal halo sign as seen on MRI is reasonably specific and relates to fluid accumulation around the portal triad.",FALSE,"Primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) is an autoimmune chronic liver disease that is characterized by the destruction of the small bile ducts in the liver. It is more commonly seen in women and usually presents with fatigue, abdominal pain, and elevated liver function tests. Ultrasound findings of hepatomegaly and diffusely low reflectivity of the liver are commonly seen in PBC. A portal vein Doppler study is typically normal in PBC, and there is usually no ascites. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis in this case is Primary biliary cirrhosis.",2,,A,TRUE,,A,FALSE,E

What is the most likely diagnosis?",SBA: Paediatrics,Distal Intestinal Obstruction Syndrome,Appendicitis,Meckel diverticulum,Fibrosing colonopathy,Gastro-oesophageal reflux,A,84%,6%,4%,5%,0%,"Explanation:
Distal Intestinal Obstruction Syndrome (DIOS)
The description of a bubbly area on an abdominal radiograph is more usually linked to meconium ileus. DIOS is also referred to as a meconium ileus equivalent as these two conditions are similar. In patients with cystic fibrosis the thicker-than-normal intestinal mucus, increase in transit time and pancreatic insufficiency all conspire to cause faecal impaction. This often occurs in early adolescence when parental control wears thin and concordance with medical management (in particular pancreatic enzyme replacement) of their cystic fibrosis can become an issue. Patients develop colicky right lower quadrant pain and tenderness when faecal matter obstructs around the terminal ileum. On x-ray this can sometimes be seen as a bubbly area close to where the caecum might be expected to be.
  Fibrosing colonopathy
By contrast this condition is caused by pancreatic enzyme replacement. High dose lipase treatment leads to progressive stricturing of the colonic submucosa. Modern preparations of enzyme supplementation have reduced the incidence of this disease.",FALSE,"Appendicitis is the most likely diagnosis in this case due to the presence of severe abdominal pain and vomiting, as well as the presence of a bubbly area in the right lower quadrant on the abdominal radiograph.

Percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL)
This is a very safe procedure with low mortality and morbidity statistics which has been developed to retrieve large renal calculi measuring 2cm in diameter or larger. It also works well for smaller recurrent cysteine stones where other avenues of management are proving insufficient.
A calyx in the lower pole is usually targeted for entry, the better to reduce the risk of creating a pneumothorax. The stone can be fragmented via ultrasonic, pneumatic or laser implements under direct vision via a nephroscope. Once the fragments are sufficiently small they can be removed.
Approximately 3% of patients experience a post-procedure haemorrhage although far fewer require any further intervention. In addition to the usual procedural risk of sepsis there is a small risk of pseudoaneurysm formation.
  Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL)
This procedure is less invasive than PCNL but less effective in patients with a high BMI. Although it can be used on large stones, it tends to be first line management for those <2cm. Patients with stones larger than this are likely to be offered PCNL as a first therapy unless they have a co-existing condition which would pose a challenge to performing PCNL such as a solitary kidney.
  Steinstrasse is a complication of ESWL treatment. It is a german word meaning ‘stone street’ and an apt description for the problems which arise when small stone fragments fall into the ureter and are seen as a line of small stones. Naturally these can cause obstruction and pain if sufficiently large.
  Nephrectomy
Where the renal function of the affected kidney is negligible (some sources quote <10%), nephrectomy can be considered.
  Open stone removal
This option remains the fallback position and is occasionally used for patients with extremely large stones or whose collecting duct system has an unfavourable anatomy.
  Prophylactic antibiotic therapy
Certainly this can be used while the patient is waiting for their intervention but will not manage the presence of the stone itself. It may be that patient co-morbidity poses a greater interventional risk than the risk of leaving the staghorn calculus in situ.

DORV is one of the five Ts of cyanotic and plethoric congenital heart disease (Tingle - i.e. Single - ventricle. The others are Tricuspid atresia, Transposition of the great vessels, TAPVC, truncus arteriosus). As the name suggests, both great vessels (the aorta and pulmonary artery) arise from the right ventricle. Consequently it is logical that 100% of cases have a VSD to facilitate drainage of the left ventricle. If the pulmonary trunk is stenotic, as is usually the case, then the lungs will be oligaemic on a CXR. Conversely in the absence of pulmonary stenosis there will be plethora - this accounts for roughly 25% of cases but yet earns DORV its place in the 5Ts. The crux of the imaging findings, and the phrase to look out for in an exam question setting, is that there is no continuity between the mitral valve and the adjacent semilunar valve. This finding is pathognomonic of DORV.
Both Edwards (trisomy 18) and Patau (trisomy 13) syndrome patients can exhibit rockerbottom feet and overlapping fingers although the findings are more closely linked with the former. DORV is associated with both trisomys.
  Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF)
TOF (not to be confused with trache-oesophageal fistula) causes cyanosis but without pulmonary plethora thus is not included in the 5 Ts.
The tetrad consists of:
VSD
Overriding aorta
Right ventricular hypertrophy (RVH)
RV outflow obstruction (hence pulmonary oligaemia)
  TOF is the most common cyanotic congenital heart disease presenting after 12 months of age. In ambulant children the classic finding is of squatting whereby the child squats following exertion in order to increase blood flow to the lungs. It usually presents by at least 3-4 months of age however, but at birth the condition can be concealed by shunting of blood through a patent ductus arteriosus (PDA). Another facet to the clinical presentation can be polycythaemia which takes place due to chronic low oxygen levels.
Owing to the RVH the cardiac apex is turned upwards contributing to an appearance referred to as ‘boot shaped’ to the cardiac shadow on a CXR.
There is a strong association with right sided aortic arch. Nearly all right sided arches are associated with some form of congenital heart disease and most of these are TOF. Conversely 25% of TOF patients also have a right sided aortic arch.
  Transposition of the Great Vessels (TGA)
TGA is one of the five Ts of cyanotic and plethoric congenital heart disease (The others are Tricuspid atresia, Tingle [ie single] ventricle, TAPVC, truncus arteriosus). Broadly speaking this presents either at birth (it is the most common cyanotic heart disease diagnosed in the first 24 hours of life), or at approximately two weeks of age. Two possible theorised reasons for the later presentation are the closure of the PDA and declining foetal haemoglobin levels leading to decompensation. When the great vessels are transposed there exists two independent circulations. This is therefore only compatible with life if a shunt mechanism also exists, such as an ASD, VSD or PDA. The CXR can be initially normal but develops an ‘egg on side’ appearance to the cardiac shadow. In some cases the transposition is ‘corrected’ where the ventricles are also switched such that the correct ventricle feeds the correct great vessel although the left and right sided circulations remain separate. In corrected transposition the CXR features of note are an apparently absent pulmonary trunk, and an abnormal aortic contour.
  Truncus arteriosus
Embryologically the great vessels begin as one 'conotruncus' which separates during development. When this separation process fails, the baby is left with a single outlet called a truncus arteriosus. On a CXR the baby will be plethoric with cardiomegaly and there are a number of associations which help point towards the answer in an exam question setting without the aid of an echocardiogram. Forked ribs, DiGeorge syndrome, a right sided arch, or an interrupted arch are all known associations.
  Interrupted arch
Fortunately interruption of the aortic arch is rare because it comes with a reasonably high mortality rate. The interruption usually occurs either just before or just after the origin of the left subclavian artery. Supply to the rest of the body distal to this point is maintained only via a patent ductus arteriosus (PDA). As well as a PDA most babies will also have a VSD leading to a triad of radiological findings (interrupted arch, PDA, VSD). On a CXR the normal aortic knuckle is absent. Another oft-quoted historical finding is the absence of the aortic impression on a barium swallow.",TRUE,"Situs inversus is not a conotruncal anomaly because it does not involve the conotruncal septum, which is the structure in the heart that separates the aorta and the pulmonary artery. Conotruncal anomalies involve defects in this structure, and can include double outlet right ventricle, tetralogy of Fallot, interrupted aortic arch, and transposition of the great vessels.",1,"This question falls under category 1: Basic factual recall, either of basic science, physics, anatomy or regarding a procedure.",A,TRUE,,A,FALSE,C

What is the most likely diagnosis?",SBA: Cardiothoracic and vascular,Lymphoid interstitial pneumonia,Lymphangioleiomyomatosis,Amyloidosis,Hypersensitivity pneumonitis,Neurofibromatosis,A,40%,45%,5%,7%,2%,"Explanation:
Lymphoid interstitial pneumonia (LIP)
LIP can be secondary to a wide range of disease; autoimmune conditions (Sjogrens disease, Hashimoto thyroiditis, Myasthenia gravis, Primary Biliary cirrhosis) or infections (PCP, Hepatitis B, Epstein-Barr). In the paediatric age range an association with AIDS is classical.
Radiologically there is ground glass opacification and centrilobular nodules with the usual demographic being middle aged women (unlike RBILD where there are the same findings but in association with heavy smoking).
  Hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HSP) also known as extrinsic allergic alveolitis (EAA)
This condition is caused by a granulomatous reaction to an inhaled allergen. Consequently it is the upper zones which are most affected. A detailed history should reveal the source of an antigen e.g. malt farmer, bird fancier, proximity to air conditioners etc. On CT EAA appears as widespread patchy ground glass opacification, mosaic in nature with nodules in a centrilobular distribution. Fibrosis and consequential volume loss occurs over months-years of allergen exposure. Involvement of the pleura (including pleural effusions) is very rare which can separate this condition from many others.
  Amyloid
Primary amyloidosis tends to cause nodule formation in the lungs with tracheal narrowing and thoracic lymph node enlargement. Secondary amyloidosis does not tend to affect the lungs.
  Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM)
LAM can go misdiagnosed for many years as emphysema. It occurs exclusively in non-smoking women of childbearing age and quite often a history of spontaneous pneumothorax is given. Radiologically there are numerous small cystic spaces surrounded by normal lung. Nodule formation is not a typical feature, neither is bronchial wall thickening. A chylous pleural effusion (negative Hounsfield units) is reasonably specific. The main differential diagnosis would be histiocytosis which tends to be associated with smoking, classically spares the costophrenic angles and gives small nodules but both can present with spontaneous pneumothorax and give small cysts. The lung volumes in LAM will remain normal whereas they can be increased in Histiocytosis (surprisingly for a fibrotic lung disease).
  Neurofibromatosis
Technically neurofibromatosis (type I) is included in the differential diagnosis for lung cysts (Particularly when apical) however the rest of the information provided is insufficient to make this the most likely answer here.",FALSE,"Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) is a rare lung disease that affects women of childbearing age. It is characterized by the presence of cysts, nodules, and thickening of the bronchial walls, which are all seen on HRCT.

A cholesterol granuloma should be at the top of the list when a blue tympanic membrane is found. The features described in the question are classical for a cholesterol granuloma – the other notable feature not provided is the absence of pulsatile tinnitus which helps distinguish it from a glomus tympanicum. A cholesterol granuloma contains both cholesterol crystals and blood (hence is bright on T1) whereas a cholesteatoma is isointense to brain parenchyma on T1 and can apparently be seen clinically as a whitish mass behind the tympanic membrane. Meningiomas are hypo or isointense on T1.",FALSE,Cholesteatoma is the most likely diagnosis because it is a common cause of middle ear masses and is homogeneously high on T1 and T2.

The duodenum is the shortest, widest and most proximal part of the small intestine. It commences at the pylorus on the right side and extends to the duodenojejunal junction on the left side. Between these two points it pursues a ‘C-shaped’ course around the head of the pancreas.
The duodenum can be divided into four parts:
D1: The superior part:
This superior part is short (around 5 cm long) and lies anterior to the body of L1. It is connected to the liver by the hepatoduodenal ligament. The first 2 cm is mobile and is referred to as the duodenal cap. Duodenal ulcers are most likely to occur in this part of the duodenum.
  D2: The descending part:
This is the longest part (around 7-10 cm long) and descends long the right side of the L1-L3 vertebrae. This part curves inferiorly around the head of the pancreas.
  D3: The inferior part:
This part is around 6-8 cm long and passes laterally to the left crossing the body of L3. This part crosses anteriorly over the inferior vena cava and aorta and is located inferiorly to the pancreas.
  D4: The ascending part:
The ascending part is short (around 5 cm long). It begins to the left of L3 and ascends to the level of the superior border of L2. During its ascent is curves anteriorly at a sharp turn referred to as the duodenojejunal flexure.

Which of the following features would support this diagnosis? Select ONE answer only.,SBA: Paediatrics,No involvement of the renal pelvis,Avid enhancement,Age >1 year,Cystic spaces,Calcification,A,57%,12%,7%,19%,4%,"Explanation:
Mesoblastic nephroma
This is the most common solid mass in a neonate and 90% of them are diagnosed within the first year of life. Presentation is usually as an abdominal mass. On ultrasound there will be a large hypoechoic renal mass which cannot clearly be separated from the normal renal parenchyma. Cystic spaces can be present due to necrosis. Pertinent negative imaging features of note are the lack of invasion into the collecting system and lack of venous invasion, the latter in particular helps to differentiate it from a Wilms tumour. Both mesoblastic nephroma and nephroblastomatosis show less enhancement post-contrast than the adjacent normal renal parenchyma. Nephroblastomatosis consists of cystic spaces whereas a mesoblastic nephroma is a solid mass which may or may not have cystic spaces.
  Renal masses by age
Neonate:
Multicystic dysplastic kidney (second most common neonatal renal mass)
Mesoblastic nephroma (most common SOLID neonatal renal mass)
Nephroblastomatosis (can be a precursor to Wilms tumour)

Multilocular cystic nephroma (affects boys, slightly younger than Wilms)
Wilms tumour (most common SOLID mass of childhood)

14435,205825,Haemorrhoids are caused by a communication between the superior rectal vein and which other veins? Select ONE answer only.,SBA: Gastrointestinal,Middle and inferior rectal veins,Azygous veins,Vesical venous plexus,Internal pudendal veins,External pudendal veins,A,72%,1%,3%,15%,8%,"Explanation:
The hepatic portal vein is the major vein of the hepatic portal venous system and carries blood from the gastrointestinal tract and spleen to the liver.
The hepatic portal venous system communicates with the systemic venous system in the following locations:
Oesophageal veins
Para-umbiical veins
Retroperitoneal veins
Rectal veins
When blood flow through the portal system is obstructed, for example due to cirrhosis, thrombosis or the presence of a tumour, pressure rises within the portal system. In these circumstances, portal hypertension develops (a portal venous pressure of >10 mmHg) and these anatomoses become congested and form venous dilatations.
An overview of the main porto-systemic anastomoses and their associated clinical conditions is given in the table below:
  Portal circulation Systemic circulation Clinical condition
Left gastric vein Azygous vein Oesophageal varices
Para-umbilical veins Inferior epigastric vein Caput medusae
Superior rectal vein Middle and inferior rectal veins Haemorrhoids",TRUE,"I chose this answer because the middle and inferior rectal veins are the veins that are most commonly involved in the formation of haemorrhoids.

This is a classic description for a Warthin tumour. A squamous cell carcinoma in this location would be a metastatic deposit from a scalp SCC and would be unlikely not to progress in the time frame given.

After a thorough history and examination her GP finds that she has a symmetrical arthritis affecting the metacarpophalangeal joints, a dry mouth, and abdominal distension. She is referred for an urgent ultrasound scan which shows scattered dilated intraheptic ducts and hypertrophy of the caudate lobe. The common bile duct measures 5 mm in diameter. What is the diagnosis?",SBA: Gastrointestinal,Primary biliary cirrhosis,Acute Budd-Chiari syndrome,Passive hepatic congestion,Hepatic veno-occlusive disease,Viral hepatitis,A,88%,4%,2%,5%,1%,"Explanation:
Primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC)
This can be difficult to distinguish from PSC however whereas PSC can involve both intra and extrahepatic ducts, PBC only involves the intrahepatic ducts. It is an autoimmune condition and, like many other autoimmune conditions, patients are typically women in their middle ages. Antimitochondrial antibodies (AMA) are present in the vast majority of patients. On imaging, the secondary cirrhotic effects are most pertinent with caudate lobe hypertrophy and left lobar atrophy. The periportal halo sign as seen on MRI is reasonably specific and relates to fluid accumulation around the portal triad. Associations with rheumatoid arthritis, Sjogrens disease, Hashimoto thyroiditis or CREST are all common.
  Hepatic venous outflow obstruction
There are three separate syndromes which all overlap both in terms of their clinical and radiological features. They are, however, separate entities, caused by subtly different processes.
Passive hepatic congestion – this arises due to a cardiac problem such as right sided heart failure of any cause or constrictive pericarditis. Tender hepatomegaly is common and on imaging the hepatic veins and IVC are notably enlarged.
Budd-Chiari syndrome – the pathology here is within the hepatic veins with thrombosis or other non-thrombotic obstruction (e.g. extrinsic compression). Acutely there is abdominal pain, ascites and hepatomegaly. The presence or absence of caudate lobe hypertrophy can help distinguish between a chronic process or an acute one where this has not had sufficient time to develop.
Hepatic veno-occlusive disease – fibrosis of the tiny venules can develop following a stem-cell transplant, and by pyrrolizidine alkaloids found in Jamaican bush teas. Clinically patients present with weight gain due to fluid retention, hepatomegaly and jaundice.

  All three cause hepatomegaly and ascites, although fluid overload in general is a particular feature of hepatic veno-occlusive disease. On CT all three can give a ‘nutmeg’ appearance to the liver when, on early phase imaging, contrast has yet to homogenise throughout the liver and consequently there is a mottled appearance which rather resembles the cut surface of a nutmeg. On delayed phase imaging the liver becomes more homogeneous. The flip-flop sign is particularly associated with Budd-Chiari syndrome with strong central and limited peripheral enhancement on early phases followed by early central washout with retained peripheral enhancement on delayed images.
  Budd-Chiari syndrome
The haemodynamics of the liver, as being different from any other organ, can give rise to some interesting pathology. In Budd-Chiari syndrome venous obstruction causes flow reversal in the portal venous system to drain the liver. Acutely this presents as a triad of abdominal pain, ascites and hepatomegaly. In many acute cases the liver function tests have not had sufficient time to become deranged. The caudate lobe usually drains directly into the IVC so may not be affected by the underlying cause of obstruction to the other hepatic veins. Consequently it is able to shoulder more of the usual burden of the liver and becomes hypertrophied. In the acute setting this has not had time to manifest and the caudate lobe will be of a normal size.
Some of the many causes of Budd-Chiari syndrome
Thrombosis of the hepatic veins
Platelets (thrombocytosis)
Pill (OCP)
Pregnancy (hypercoagulable state)
Polycythaemia rubra vera
Non-thrombotic causes
Mechanical compression by a tumour
Right atrial myxoma
Constrictive pericarditis
  On CT the enhancement pattern is described as being ‘flip-flop’, with strong central and limited peripheral enhancement on early phases followed by early central washout with retained peripheral enhancement on delayed images. Alternatively the whole liver may appear mottled with a ‘nutmeg’ type pattern due to the venous congestion. On Doppler ultrasound or MRI the hepatic veins will show a reduction in calibre or not be seen at all and on Doppler insonation the hepatic veins may show little or no flow. Flow in the portal venous system, on the other hand, may be reversed. In chronic cases a veritable spiders-web of small collateral vessels can be seen on angiography; they can also be seen on MRI and are described as having a comma-shape.
  Passive hepatic congestion
This is similar to chronic Budd-Chiari syndrome, but whereas Budd-Chiari syndrome arises due to hepatic outflow obstruction, in heart failure leading to hepatic congestion there is no mechanical obstruction. In contrast to acute thrombotic Budd-Chiari syndrome there is distension of the hepatic veins and IVC, a feature which distinguishes it from hepatic veno-occlusive disease as well. Other signs of heart failure, such as pleural effusions and ascites may be present concurrently.
  Hepatic veno-occlusive disease
The outcome of hepatic veno-occlusive disease is similar to that of Budd-Chiari syndrome but the mechanism is different. Hepatic congestion develops as a consequence of fibrosis to the venules within the liver. This can occur secondary to chemotherapy or bone marrow transplantation and also bizarrely due to pyrrolizidine alkaloids which are found in Jamaican bush teas. On imaging there is overlap with the features of Budd-Chiari syndrome but crucially the hepatic veins should appear normal; it is the smaller venules which cause the problem and these are not seen on ultrasound or CT.
  Viral hepatitis
The imaging findings of hepatitis are non-specific and include hepatomegaly, decreased echogenicity, periportal oedema, and gallbladder wall thickening. The ‘starry sky’ appearance is used to describe a liver which has a number of bright echogenic dots on a background of diffuse low reflectivity and this has traditionally been associated with hepatitis however both the sensitivity and specificity of this sign are low.",TRUE,"Primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) is a chronic autoimmune disorder that affects the liver. The characteristic symptoms include symmetrical arthritis affecting the metacarpophalangeal joints, dry mouth, and abdominal distension.

  Necrotising enterocolitis
This is the most common gastrointestinal emergency for premature babies. It results from an immature immune system being unable to cope with mucosal ulceration. Almost all cases occur before the baby reaches 10 days old. Pneumatosis intestinalis (intramural gas) is the hallmark of the condition on abdominal radiography and appears as curvilinear or bubbly areas. Branching gas within the liver, indicative of portal venous gas can also occur but is not as serious a finding as it would be for an adult. Surgery is definitely indicated however, if there is evidence of perforation and for this reason patients should undergo a horizontal beam x-ray. If performed decubitus the left side should be down in order to better visualise air against the contour of the liver. On an over-table view the ‘football’ sign, where a large collection of gas rises centrally, is seen if there is sufficient free gas within the abdomen.
  Meconium ileus
This condition is strongly associated with cystic fibrosis but not with prematurity. The thicker-than-normal intestinal mucus, increase in transit time and pancreatic insufficiency all conspire to cause impaction of meconium leading to small bowel obstruction in neonates. It should be suspected if the baby does not pass meconium within the first 2 days of life. On an abdominal radiograph there will be no air-fluid levels since no fluid is present but multiple gas filled dilated loops of small bowel will be seen. The meconium can sometimes be seen as a bubbly area in the right lower quadrant where it has impacted within the terminal ileum.
  Meconium plug
Whereas meconium ileus leads to small bowl obstruction, meconium plug syndrome leads to large bowel obstruction due to functional immaturity of the colon. This will also present within the first two days of life with a failure to pass meconium. Some literature associates this condition with babies born to diabetic mothers and around a quater of patients have cystic fibrosis. The condition can be treated with a water-soluble contrast enema.
  Meconium peritonitis
When there is antenatal bowel perforation the result is a chemical peritonitis as opposed to a purulent one since the bowel is as yet unpopulated by the usual flora of life after birth. The result is calcification scattered around the abdomen. If the perforation spontaneously heals itself then the prognosis is excellent and the finding of abdominal calcification may be purely incidental.
  Hirschsprung disease
There is a congenital absence of parasympathetic ganglia in the muscular and submucosal layers of a segment of colon, usually the sigmoid colon. The affected segment is unable to relax to pass meconium and patients therefore present with failure to pass meconium or sometimes within the first six weeks of life with severe constipation with overflow diarrhoea. Classically on a barium enema there is an inverted cone shape formed between the normal and abnormal bowel segments and the diagnosis should be confirmed using a suction biopsy below this transition point. Another feature seen on a barium enema is a result of abnormally coordinated contractions of the affected segment which appears as so-called ‘persistent corrugation’.",TRUE,"I chose number 2, Necrotising enterocolitis, because bubbly and curvilinear areas on an abdominal x-ray are consistent with the presence of air within the intestinal wall, which is a common symptom of necrotising enterocolitis.

When calcified pleural plaques are seen bilaterally it is virtually pathognomonic of prior asbestos exposure. Of all asbestos related pleural plaques around 85% are calcified. Involvement of the mediastinal pleura should raise the possibility of mesothelioma but involvement of the costophrenic angles should raise the possibility of an alternative diagnosis as these are usually spared in asbestos related plaque disease. Sparing can occur in other pathologies too and should not be taken as an absolute sign of asbestosis, merely that involvement of the costophrenic angles suggests an alternative diagnosis. Unilateral pleural plaques can be caused by any previous insult such as surgery or an empyema although the most common cause is still asbestos related lung disease.
  Mediastinal lymph node calcification
This can be seen in a number of conditions:
Tuberculosis
Histoplasmosis

Most cases are monostotic but polyostotic cases occur around 20% of the time. Virtually any bone can be affected although the long bones tend to be more frequently affected in the polyostotic form. That said, fibrous dysplasia is also a typical differential diagnosis for a rib or skull lesion.
Classically the appearances on x-ray or CT is described as 'ground glass' in matrix, and situated within the centre of the bone (i.e. medullary), but often causing bony expansion. Since the bone is abnormal there is an increased risk of fractures but unless there is an acute injury there should not be a periosteal reaction.
On a nuclear medicine bone scan the lesions tend to show increased uptake and this is therefore rarely useful in diagnosing this condition.
Aside from pathological fractures, the condition can also occasionally be complicated by secondary degeneration which would be to osteosarcoma and should be suspected if the patient complains of pain and the growth of a soft tissue mass. This occurs more frequently in patients who have previously been exposed to radiation.
There are a number of eponymous or descriptive terms associated with fibrous dysplasia:
Shepherds crook deformity - coxa varus deformity of the proximal femur. This is usually used to describe the effect of fibrous dysplasia on the proximal femur with chronic bowing and remodelling secondary to microfractures, but the same appearance can occur with conditions such as Paget disease or osteogenesis imperfecta, for the same reasons.
Protrusio acetabuli - fibrous dysplasia is one of a number of things which can cause protrusion of the femoral head into the pelvis due to remodelling of the acetabulum.
Leontiasis ossea - facial involvement causing a specific appearance said to resemble that of a lion. Owing to canal stenosis caused by bony expansion patients can exhibit cranial nerve palsies.
Cherubism - facial (maxilla and mandible) involvement causes a specific appearance said to resemble that of a cherub. Owing to canal stenosis caused by bony expansion patients can exhibit cranial nerve palsies. Cherubism is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion.
McCune-Albright syndrome - this almost always only affects girls and consists of a triad of cafe-au-lait spots, precocious puberty (or other endocrine pathology), and polyostotic fibrous dysplasia. The cafe-au-lait pigmentation is often on the back and can commonly be seen to respect the midline.
Mazabraud syndrome - this is a very rare condition. Patients present with polyostotic fibrous dysplasia and soft tissue tumours and are at increased risk of malignant degeneration to osteosarcoma.
  Hand-Schüller-Christian Disease is a type of histiocytosis.",FALSE,I chose 3. Shepherds Crook deformity because it is not part of the spectrum of fibrous dysplasia. Fibrous dysplasia is a benign bone disorder characterized by the replacement of normal bone with fibrous tissue. The other four conditions listed are all part of the spectrum of fibrous dysplasia. Leontiasis Ossea is a rare disorder characterized by a painful enlargement of the bones of the face and skull. Hand-Schüller-Christian Disease is a rare form of lymphoma that affects the bones and skin. Cherubism is a rare genetic disorder characterized by the enlargement of the lower jaw and facial bones. McCune-Albright syndrome is a rare genetic disorder characterized by the presence of multiple bone lesions.,1,"3. A question about the application of knowledge, what is the best treatment?

10206,205825,A 35-year-old man involved in a severe road traffic accident is brought to A+E. He undergoes a trauma CT scan which shows a complex pelvic fracture with a large pelvic haematoma. The scan shows a large contrast blush around the right obturator artery tracking towards the haematoma. The patient becomes unstable after the scan. What should the next management step be?,SBA: Musculoskeletal and Trauma,Target artery embolisation,Surgical exploration,Conservative only,USS guided therapy,Retrograde urethrogram,A,85%,12%,1%,1%,1%,"Explanation:
A retrograde urethrogram can be performed if there is concern regarding a possible urethral or bladder injury. For optimum results this should be achieved prior to IV contrast however can still be performed after a CT scan if necessary. It is, however, somewhat futile in the case of an unstable patient with a large pelvic haematoma and will go no way towards halting further blood loss.
Target artery embolisation via endovascular techniques can be hugely successful in such cases and is associated with a far lower morbidity and mortality than surgical exploration. Pelvic fractures are associated with a high risk of vascular injury. Catheter angiography is the gold standard for identifying a bleeding point although the scan results in this case suggest a target vessel even prior to catheter angiography. Endovascular embolisation can be extremely successful in achieving haemostasis for arterial bleeding but is not useful where the haematoma is thought to derive from the bony fractures.",TRUE,Target artery embolisation is the best management step for this patient because it will help to stop the bleeding from the obturator artery and reduce the size of the pelvic haematoma. Embolisation involves the injection of a substance (such as a coil or glue) into the artery to block it and stop the flow of blood. This can be done under ultrasound guidance and is a minimally invasive procedure that can be performed quickly and effectively. This will help stabilize the patient and allow them to receive the necessary treatment for their fracture.,3,"3.

What would be the next best test to confirm the diagnosis?  ,SBA: Central Nervous and Head & Neck,CTA,Unenhanced CT,MRA,DSA,CTV,A,63%,8%,16%,12%,1%,"Explanation:
The diagnostic pathway to investigate for intracranial aneurysms following a subarachnoid haemorrhage is:
CT angiogram
Invasive angiogram
Second invasive angiogram after approx 10 days.
Although in this patient’s case the diagnosis of a subarachnoid haemorrhage has not been fully established, the presence of an aneurysm must be excluded.
Bear in mind that the correct answer may change if the wording of the questions is different. For example a DSA invasive angiogram would be the gold standard investigation for an aneurysm but is not usually done first; a CTA is therefore the next best test in the first instance.  Similarly an MRI scan would be the next best test to confirm the diagnosis of a subarachnoid haemorrhage but does not have a sufficiently low false negative rate to exclude an aneurysm. In the answers provided here, with the exception of the unenhanced CT, only angiographic options are available and hence this is not the correct answer.",FALSE,"MRA is the next best test to confirm a diagnosis of subarachnoid hemorrhage because it provides detailed images of the brain and its blood vessels, which can help identify the exact location of the hemorrhage.

Kienbock disease is avascular necrosis of the lunate and usually occurs either in young men or in middle aged women. There is an association with negative ulnar variance where the ulna is shorter than it should be and the stresses on the wrist are therefore altered.

The parenchyma of the kidney is divided into two major structures:
The outer renal cortex and;
The inner renal medulla
  The renal cortex extends into the medulla and divides it into triangular shaped areas referred to as the renal pyramids. Each renal pyramid combines with the renal cortex above it to form a renal lobe. Between the renal pyramids are projections of renal cortex referred to as the renal columns.
The functional unit of the kidney is the nephron. These are responsible for the production of urine and span the cortex and medulla. The initial filtering portion of the nephron is the renal corpuscle, which is located in the cortex. This is followed by the renal tubule that extends into the renal pyramids. Within the renal cortex lies the medullary ray, which is a collection of renal tubules that drains into a single collecting duct.
At the apex of each renal pyramid is the renal papilla. This empties urine into the minor calyx. Several minor calices combine to form a major calyx. Urine drains from the minor calices into the major calyx and the empties into the funnel-shaped renal pelvis. Urine then drains from the renal pelvis into the ureter.

12646,205825,A 40-year-old woman complaining of blurred vision is referred for an MRI scan by her neurologist. This shows T2 and FLAIR hyperintensities in the corpus callosum orientated perpendicularly to the lateral ventricles. One of the lesions shows restriction of diffusion and enhancement with contrast. The rest do not. What is the most likely explanation?,SBA: Central Nervous and Head & Neck,Demyelination due to MS,Hurler syndrome,Antiphospholipid syndrome,Cryptococcus infection,Multifocal astrocytomas,A,97%,1%,1%,1%,1%,"Explanation:
Multiple sclerosis
This is an idiopathic demyelinating disease with oedematous perivascular inflammation in the acute stage progressing to demyelination with proliferation of the astroglia in the chronic phase. There are oblong elliptical plaques of high T2 signal at the callososeptal interface.
Other highly testable features:
Involvement of the middle cerebral peduncle is specific to multiple sclerosis when attempting to differentiate it from small vessel ischaemic changes
Lesions can cross the midline
Axial T2 sequences are better than FLAIR for posterior fossa lesions
Acute lesions can enhance with contrast, classically in an ‘incomplete ring’
Thalamic involvement is rare and suggests the possibility of ADEM instead
Cryptococcus
This is an opportunistic yeast-like fungus which therefore requires a degree of immunocompromise, typically AIDS. The cryptococcomas are non-enhancing low density lesions in the basal ganglia. These show as high signal on T2 sequences. A granulomatous meningitis can also occur. They can be differentiated from VR spaces on FLAIR where VR spaces will suppress (being CSF in content) whereas the mucoid cryptococcomas will not.
  Astrocytoma
Multifocal astrocytomas would not be impossible but are statistically unlikely.
  Antiphospholipid syndrome
Antiphospholipid syndrome is technically a differential diagnosis to the findings of multiple sclerosis on MRI however is largely only included for the sake of completeness.
  Hurler syndrome
This unpleasant disease is a mucopolysaccharidosis and like most others is autosomal recessive in inheritance. It affects very young children and is usually fatal within the first 12 months of life. Prominent perivascular spaces are seen on MRI brain, hence its inclusion here as a theoretical differential diagnosis.",TRUE,"I chose this because multiple sclerosis (MS) is a common cause of demyelination in the corpus callosum, which is the area that was shown to have hyperintensities on the MRI scan.

The appendix is a narrow, worm-shaped, blind-ended tube that is attached to the posteromedial end of the caecum. It has a short triangular mesentery called the mesoappendix that suspends it from the mesentery of the terminal ileum.
It contains a large quantity of lymphoid tissue but serves no important function in humans. The position of the free-end of the appendix is highly variable. There are five main locations at which it can be found, the two commonest being the retrocaecal and subcaecal positions.
The distribution of positions is as follows:
Ascending retrocaecal (64%)
Subcaecal (32%)
Transverse retrocaecal (2%)
Ascending preileal (1%)
Ascending retroileal (0.5%)
    Distribution of the position of the appendix tip (from An Atlas of Anatomy by John Charles Grant)
  Appendicitis is acute inflammation of the appendix and is one of the most common causes of the acute abdomen. It is typically a disease of children and young adults with a peak incidence in the 2nd to 3rd decades of life.
The classical presentation of appendicitis is with poorly localized periumbilical pain (referred pain from the visceral peritoneum). Within a day or two this pain typically localizes to McBurney’s point (pain from parietal peritoneum). There is usually associated fever, anorexia and nausea.
McBurney’s point is defined as being the point that lies one-third of the distance from the anterior superior iliac spine to the umbilicus. It roughly corresponds with the most common position of the attachment of the base of the appendix to the caecum.

Spontaneous haemorrhage/rupture is a known complication of AMLs and is termed Wunderlich syndrome. Patients with AMLs larger than 4cm are at particularly increased risk of this. Wunderlich syndrome can occur in the context of Tuberous Sclerosis or in a patient with an isolated large AML. Although Wunderlich syndrome is most commonly caused by an underlying AML, it can also be seen with renal cell carcinoma or vascular malformations.
Tuberous sclerosis
This condition would explain the presence of a fat containing renal lesion (if it wasn't simply a sporadic finding) but has no relation to the dilated and inflamed appendix.

  The PSA density is calculated by taking the PSA and dividing it by the volume of the prostate. The volume is calculated as: Height x Length x Depth x π/6 (the volume of an ellipsoid). It accounts for the increase in size of the prostate which occurs in many men with increasing age and allows a far more comparable indication of the likelihood of malignancy. 0.1 is considered a normal PSA density value. Prostate cancers are usually seen in those with a prostate density of >0.1ng/ml/cc.

9701,205825,"A 14-year-old boy is found to have a lucent bone lesion in his right ilium. It is permeative, has an associated periosteal reaction and there is an associated soft tissue component measuring 15cm in depth. What is the most likely diagnosis?",SBA: Paediatrics,Ewing sarcoma,Osteosarcoma,Chondroblastoma,Hans-Christian-Schueller disease,Eosinophilic granuloma,A,76%,16%,3%,1%,4%,"Explanation:
Ewing sarcoma
This is an aggressive cancer which affects children. The age distribution peaks at 15 years and initial presentation is with pain and a mass but blood tests will often show a high white cell count and a raised ESR. For this reason it can sometimes be misdiagnosed as infection. X-ray findings are of an aggressive lytic lesion with a lamellated periosteal reaction seen in around half cases (sunburst/spiculated periosteal reactions can be seen in a fifth of cases). The moth-eaten, permeative bony destruction seen on x-ray is a late finding. Any bone can be affected but 60% of cases involve a long bone, in particular the femur. On MRI, if not on x-ray, a large soft-tissue component can usually be seen. About a third of cases have metastatic disease at presentation and in these patients anaemia is a common finding.
  Osteosarcoma
These are bone forming tumours which can either be primary, or secondary. Primary osteosarcomas occur in young patients or young adults when the bones are more active during adolescence than in later life, and have a predilection for either the proximal tibia or distal femur i.e. around the knee joint. Secondary osteosarcomas occur as malignant degeneration of pre-existing bone lesions. Clinically they present as a painful mass with a fever. Pain on movement is also typical. In later disease patients may have a raised serum ALP. On x-ray they are poorly defined aggressive lesions with sunburst periosteal reaction and fluffy cloud-like osseous matrix. For staging the patient should receive an MRI of the entire of the affected bone (to rule out synchronous lesions), a nuclear medicine bone scan and a CT chest. Tissue biopsy should only be performed at tertiary referral centres where to mitigate the risk of seeding the biopsy tract, immediate tissue analysis with the option of immediate amputation can be performed.
  Some of the pertinent subtypes of osteosarcoma
 Parosteal
 Lower grade, older age (20-50s)
 Telangiectatic
 Purely lytic, poor prognosis, fluid-fluid levels
 Multicentric
 Ages 5-10 with very poor prognosis
  Chondroblastoma
Largely speaking these tumours only arise in epiphyses or epiphyseal equivalent bones (such as the patella) and are therefore confined, in-terms of age, to children or adolescents. They can present in a fairly indolent fashion with pain, swelling and tenderness preceding diagnosis by weeks, if not months. They typically occur in the long bones, around two thirds are found in the leg and half are found around the knee. On x-ray they appear as a lucent, lobulated lesion with a thin sclerotic margin. Surrounding oedema, if present, can be surprisingly florid, even leading to an overestimation of the extent of the underlying lesion. Calcification associated with the lesion does occur but is better appreciated with CT.
  Histiocytosis (aka Langerhans cell histiocytosis - LCH)
There are three separate forms of this disease:
Eosinophilic granuloma (70%) – a limited version confined to the skeleton in children or young adults. Clinically presents as fever, raised WCC and ESR with painful bony lesions. In the skull these have a typical ‘beveled edge’ or ‘hole within a hole’ appearance or can be seen as a ‘button sequestrum’. In the spine it is one of the main causes of vertebra plana.
Hand-Schüller-Christian Disease (20%) – classically a triad of destructive bony lesions, diabetes insipidus and exophthalmos. In a quarter of these patients the lungs are involved with cyst formation and spontaneous pneumothoraces possible. Nodule formation, fibrosis and honeycombing is also seen.
Letterer-Siwe Disease (10%) – a fulminant multi-organ variant affecting very young infants
There is a strong association with smoking for patients who develop pulmonary features of LCH. Heavy smoking causes an accumulation of Langerhans cells and hence, as with other inspiration-related lung diseases, there is a predilection for the upper zones. The Langerhans cells can collect with other cells and become small granulomas seen as small lung nodules. Despite being a type of fibrotic lung disease the lung volumes can be increased.  Small lung cysts form and there is a risk of spontaneous pneumothorax. In the MCQ world there is sparing of the costophrenic angles.",TRUE,"I chose Ewing sarcoma because it is the most common type of bone tumor in adolescents, and it typically involves the long bones of the body, such as the ilium.

12861,205825,You are performing an FNA for a patient with an enlarged inguinal lymph node. The histology is reported as squamous cell carcinoma. Which of the following is the LEAST likely primary source?,"SBA: Genito urinary, Adrenal, Obstetrics & Gynaecology and Breast",Prostate cancer,Penile cancer,Scrotal skin cancer,Anal cancer,Bladder cancer,A,63%,3%,3%,5%,26%,"Explanation:
Men
Firstly prostate cancer is nearly always adenocarcinoma not squamous cell carcinoma and secondly regional nodes in the context of prostate cancer would be internal and external iliac nodes. Inguinal nodes are therefore less likely to be from prostate cancer; these would be considered as non-regional metastatic disease.
When not adenocarcinomatous in origin, prostate cancer can (rarely) be transitional cell, sarcoma, lymphoma or adenoid cystic cancer.
Inguinal lymph node involvement would be considered regional disease for anal cancers in both sexes as well as penile and scrotal skin cancers in men and vulval or vaginal cancers in women.
Scrotal skin cancers are usually squamous cell in origin and spread via the lymphatics, initially to the inguinal nodes. Of note involvement of the inguinal nodes may be contralateral to the site of the index tumour since both sets of inguinal nodes drain the whole scrotal sac. Testicular tumours however, will only spread to the inguinal region as regional disease if the patient has undergone previous inguinal or scrotal surgery. In the absence of prior intervention the inguinal region is considered as a non-regional area for testicular tumours.
  Proportion of squamous cell carcinomas
Penile cancer
  >90%
Anal cancer
Scrotal skin cancer
Cervical cancer
Vulval cancer
Vaginal cancer
>80%
Bladder cancer
<10%
Prostate cancer
<1%
Testicular cancer
<1% (can be a site of metastatic SCC though)
  Women
Cervical cancer is predominantly squamous cell in origin and spreads initially via the obturator nodes and thence to the internal or external iliac nodes. The lymphatic spread of vaginal cancer depends to an extent on its exact location. Cancers situated in the upper two thirds of the vagina behaves in a similar way to cervical cancer (Obturater, internal and external iliac nodes) but those in the lower third do spread first to the inguinal or femoral nodes as local disease as do vulval cancers.
  Prostate cancer
The vast majority of cancers of the prostate are adenocarcinomas and the risk of developing prostate cancer increases with age to such an extent that by the age of 80 approximately 80% of men will have some neoplastic foci within the prostate although these may be completely occult and never manifest clinically.  Where the disease does advance it becomes one of the top three most common causes of death from cancer in men alongside lung cancer and colorectal cancer. Serum Prostatic Specific Antigen (PSA) levels have been used in prostate cancer screening since the 1990s.
MRI is crucial to provide accurate staging but is also gaining in momentum on its way to becoming a screening tool in its own right.
The majority of prostate cancers arise from the peripheral zone and causes the normally high T2 signal to become low signal. Additionally the cancer should show restriction in diffusion (ie high signal on DWI, correspondingly low on ADC). It is important to view the T1 images as well in order to exclude the possibility of haemorrhage which can sometimes look like a prostate cancer. The precise appearance of a haemorrhage changes depending on the timeframe.",FALSE,"Anal cancer is the least likely primary source for a squamous cell carcinoma in an enlarged inguinal lymph node because squamous cell carcinoma is most commonly associated with cancers of the skin, head, neck, and other organs, but not typically anal cancer.",1,"This question would fall under category 1: Basic factual recall, either of basic science, physics, anatomy or regarding a procedure.",A,TRUE,,A,TRUE,A

Hirschsprung disease
There is a congenital absence of parasympathetic ganglia in the muscular and submucosal layers of a segment of colon, usually the sigmoid colon.

Which of the following would best fit with these findings?,SBA: Gastrointestinal,Haemachromatosis,Amiodarone therapy,Diffuse steatosis,Focal fatty change,Wilson disease,A,71%,10%,6%,4%,9%,"Explanation:
It is more usual to talk about haemochromatosis as causing signal drop out on the in-phase images or to talk about fatty lesions in terms of signal drop out on the out-of-phase images. The absence of signal drop-out on the out of phase images serves only to prove that there is no fatty component to the area being described.
  Haemochromatosis
The primary version of this disease can be inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion. Excess dietary iron is absorbed and this accumulates in all tissues of the body leading to various different problems.
Secondary haemochromatosis can arise if patients receive numerous blood transfusions without sufficient chelation to mitigate against the iron overload.
Cirrhosis – the presence of the excess iron in the liver leads to unusual signal properties on an MRI scan. Iron is paramagnetic and causes spin dephasing. T2* and T2 sequences are particularly vulnerable to this effect but lower than expected signal will be seen on all sequences. Importantly the signal from the spleen and bone marrow should be normal. By contrast they will be involved in cases of transfusional siderosis.
Generalised osteoporosis
Hook like osteophytes on the radial aspect of the metacarpal heads – these are highly characteristic
Chondrocalcinosis, particularly affecting the knees
Insulin dependent diabetes
Congestive cardiomyopathy
Skin pigmentation
  Wilson disease
Inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion, this disease results from an excess of copper within the body due to the inability of the liver to excrete it. It can present in childhood with cirrhosis but later presentations are more likely to be due to the neuropsychiatric manifestations. Clinically adolescent or adult patients develop tremor and dysarthria due to copper deposition in the lentiform nucleus. The classic diagnostic feature is Kayser-Fleischer pigment rings in the eyes. Radiologically the following features can be seen:
Hepatic manifestations: The liver appears normal on MRI since fatty infiltration effectively cancels out the paramagnetic effects of copper
Musculoskeletal manifestations: Generalised osteoporosis, subarticular cysts, chondrocalcinosis and arthropathy which can mimic CPPD
CNS manifestations: White matter atrophy and T2 hyperintensities predominantly affecting the basal ganglia and thalami. T1 signal is also high in these areas, differentiating it from many of the other basal ganglia disorders. There is a classical feature of ‘sparing of the red nucleus’ leading to an appearance known as the giant panda sign at the level of the pons.
  Focal steatosis also known as focal fatty infiltration
The liver plays a small role in fat storage and subtle variation in blood supply and drainage between different areas can lead to variations in the amount of fat in those areas. Focal fatty change is very common and has a geographic appearance on all imaging modalities, with a lack of mass effect (i.e. preservation of the vascular architecture). It can occur anywhere within the liver but is classically found adjacent to the falciform ligament (i.e. segments II, III and IV). Fat-identifying sequences on MRI can be very useful to cinch the diagnosis with signal drop out on out-of-phase images. Focal fatty sparing on the other hand appears as the inverse of this and on CT will be seen as isoattenuation on a background of a diffusely hypoattenuating liver. On ultrasound the liver will be diffusely hyperechoic when compared to the right kidney, and the spared area will be hypoechoic.
  Amiodarone therapy
Amiodarone is an anti-arrhythmic drug which contains iodine (am-IOD-arone). Consequently, as it accumulates in the liver, it can cause significant increase in density to the liver on a CT scan.
 ",FALSE,"The presence of low T1 signal in the liver on MRI scan and signal gain on the out of phase images is indicative of diffuse steatosis. Diffuse steatosis is a condition in which fat accumulates in the liver cells, leading to a decrease in the T1 signal. The signal gain on the out of phase images is caused by the fat protons being in different phases of the RF pulse.",2,3. A question about the interpretation of imaging results.,A,FALSE,,C,FALSE,E

10956,205825,A 36-year-old man with an extensive smoking history presents with mild dyspnoea and a cough.

What is the most likely diagnosis?,SBA: Cardiothoracic and vascular,Respiratory bronchiolitis interstitial lung disease,Subacute hypersensitivity pneumonitis,Desquamative interstitial pneumonia,Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis,Langerhans cell histiocytosis,A,72%,3%,7%,1%,17%,"Explanation:
There is much overlap in the features of the various different fibrotic lung diseases.
Therefore, look for specific features which are most strongly associated with the different conditions.
  Respiratory Bronchiolitis Interstitial Lung disease (RBILD)
This condition is heavily associated with smoking and can be seen as centrilobular nodules with ground glass opacification – therefore, look for this trio of findings. Appearances are often very similar to desquamative interstitial pneumonia. Patients can be relatively young.
  Hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HSP) also known as extrinsic allergic alveolitis (EAA)
This condition is caused by a granulomatous reaction to an inhaled allergen. Consequently it is the upper zones which are most affected. A detailed history should reveal the source of an antigen e.g. malt farmer, bird fancier, proximity to air conditioners etc. On CT EAA appears as widespread patchy ground glass opacification, mosaic in nature with nodules in a centrilobular distribution. Fibrosis and consequential volume loss occurs over months-years of allergen exposure. Involvement of the pleura (including pleural effusions) is very rare which can separate this condition from many others.
  Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF)
IPF (Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis) can only be diagnosed in the absence of a precipitating condition such as asbestosis, rheumatoid arthritis, or drug toxicity. Where such exists, the condition is termed UIP (Usual interstitial pneumonia). CFA (Cryptogenic fibrosing alveolitis) is a historic term for the same thing. IPF is not a true differential diagnosis for cysts since the low attenuation areas seen on CT are not true cysts (no epithelial lining is present). The macrocystic honeycombing seen is merely the consequence of the fibrotic process underlying the condition. Another clue to the diagnosis of IPF lies in the distribution; there is an apicobasilar gradient with honeycombing and traction bronchiectasis affecting the lung bases and fading away superiorly.
  Histiocytosis (also known as Langerhans cell histiocytosis - LCH)
There are three separate forms of this disease:
Eosinophilic granuloma (70%) – a limited version confined to the skeleton in children or young adults. Clinically presents as fever, raised WCC and ESR with painful bony lesions. In the skull these have a typical ‘beveled edge’ or ‘hole within a hole’ appearance or can be seen as a ‘button sequestrum’. In the spine it is one of the main causes of vertebra plana.
Hand-Schüller-Christian Disease (20%) – classically a triad of destructive bony lesions, diabetes insipidus and exophthalmos. In a quarter of these patients the lungs are involved with cyst formation and spontaneous pneumothoraces possible. Nodule formation, fibrosis and honeycombing is also seen.
Letterer-Siwe Disease (10%) – a fulminant multi-organ variant affecting very young infants
  Desquamative interstitial Pneumonia - DIP
It is very difficult to distinguish DIP from RBILD; a biopsy is usually required. DIP is however, far rarer than RBILD. There is a strong association with heavy cigarette smoking. On CT it is seen as diffuse ground glass opacification (GGO) which can have a peripheral or lower lobe predominance.
 ",FALSE,"The most likely diagnosis is Subacute hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP). This is because the CT scan findings are consistent with the characteristic findings of HP, which include patchy ground glass opacities in the upper lobes, centrilobular nodules, and apical emphysematous changes. HP is an inflammatory condition of the lungs caused by an allergic reaction to inhaled substances, such as dust, mold, or other substances. It is often seen in people with a history of smoking, which is the case in this patient.",2,"This question falls under the category of clinical judgement, what is the correct diagnosis?",B,FALSE,,E,TRUE,A

Select ONE answer only.,SBA: Paediatrics,Cardiomegaly,Portal vein feeding branch,Presence of calcification,Claw sign,Precocious puberty,A,72%,10%,9%,1%,7%,"Explanation:
Haemangioendothelioma
These are benign lesions which can cause elevation of the serum AFP and endothelial growth factor but the vast majority occur in babies under the age of 6 months. Around half of cases are associated with the presence of a cutaneous haemangioma. They are large vascular tumours and on imaging behave as might be expected of a haemangioma with peripheral enhancement with gradual filling in on CT and flow voids on MRI. Calcifications can be seen with these lesions but they are finer, more granular calcifications; not coarse. Owing to their size they often cause significant right to left shunting of blood resulting in congestive heart failure. Thrombocytopaenia also occurs due to platelet trapping (known as the Kasabach-Merritt sequence). N.B. these lesions should not be confused with epithelioid haemangioendotheliomas which occur in adults.

Please note that the question asks which region is INCORRECTLY matched.
  Functional imaging in dementia
Tc99m-HMPAO SPECT and 18F-FDG PET produce very similar patterns when used to image patients with cognitive decline however the latter is considered to have a greater sensitivity and specificity and is therefore preferred.
Two structures bear particular importance in the imaging of dementia; the precuneus and the cingulate gyrus. Both are best appreciated on sagittal views.
Precuneus: The precuneus is located on the medial surface of each hemisphere, in the posterior parietal lobe. It has functions in motor planning, working memory and also connections to the visual pathways.
        The cingulate gyrus: The cinculate gyrus is also located on the medial side of each hemisphere and runs anteroposteriorly just above the corpus callosum. The cingulate gyrus has complex functions to do with learning, emotional response and memory.
        Alzheimer's disease
The radiological findings of this well-known disease are diffuse sulcal and ventricular enlargement. There is a disproportionate effect to the anterior temporal lobes, hippocampi and sylvian fissures with sparing of the sensorimotor and visual cortices, thalami and cerebellum. Functional studies (Tc-HMPAO SPECT or F-18 FDG PET) show reduced uptake in the precuneus, posterior cingulate gyrus, frontal and temporoparietal lobes but with characteristic sparing of the sensorimotor cortex and basal ganglia bilaterally. Importantly there is also sparing of the occipital lobes, which helps differentiate it from Lewy body dementia where the occipital lobes are involved. Other differences between the two conditions are seen with specific dopamine transporter agent imaging techniques
  Lewy body dementia
There is a generalised decrease in cerebral volume (sparing the hippocampi). Temporo-parietal hypoperfusion on HMPAO Tc99m SPECT scanning is indicative of Lewy body dementia. Involvement of the occipital cortex, which is typically spared in Alzheimer’s disease, sets the two apart from one another on PET studies. The cingulate island sign has also been ascribed to Lewy body dementia, where there is preservation of metabolism in the mid-posterior cingulate gyrus. If present, this is said to be specific for Lewy body dementia.",TRUE,"The occipital lobes are not typically associated with Alzheimer's disease. Alzheimer's disease is characterized by the loss of neurons and the formation of plaques and tangles in the hippocampus, frontal lobes, precuneus, and cingulate gyrus. Lewy body dementia is associated with the sparing of the hippocampus.",2,"This question falls under category 2: A question about clinical judgement, what is the correct diagnosis?",C,TRUE,,A,TRUE,A

Lymphangitis carcinomatosis is easy to recognize on a scan but can be described in a number of different ways on paper. It occurs when tumour cells, spread via the lymphatics, accumulate in the connective tissues of the lung, in particular the interlobular septa. The classical description is as a smooth thick reticular polygonal network.

Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS)
PCOS affects around 5% of women and patients experience a broad spectrum of issues with it ranging from being completely asymptomatic through to infertility and other important gynaecological problems.
The typical patient with PCOS is overweight with impaired glucose tolerance. High blood pressure and high lipid levels may be found on blood tests and excess circulating androgen levels cause an increase in the LH to FSH ratio as well as explaining the other physical complaints of many patients such as acne and hirsutism. It should be noted that a diagnosis of PCOS should not be made on the basis of imaging findings.
Patients with PCOS often (but not always) show ovarian enlargement, each with a volume in excess of 15cm3.  There are ususally multiple small cysts within the ovaries; those which give the syndrome its name. These are the developing follicles caused by aberrations in hormone levels. They usually appear around the edge of the ovary, in a subcapsular location, as anechoic rounded cystic structures and there are typically around 5-10 per ovary at any one time but can be many more in number than this. The appearance is sometimes described as looking like a string of pearls. It should be noted however that this appearance can also be seen in otherwise normal women too.

9616,205825, A 30-year-old man complains to his GP of severe odynophagia. You are asked to perform a barium swallow to aid diagnosis. The oesophagus is abnormal and you suspect the patient may have Barrett oesophagitis.

Barrett oesophagus
Metaplasia of the usual squamous epithelium to columnar epithelium as a result of reflux is termed Barrett oesophagus and predisposes the patient to developing adenocarcinoma. It affects the distal oesophagus adjacent to the gastro-oesophageal junction. Long strictures can develop and on a barium swallow the mucosa appears to have a reticular pattern. Tertiary contractions may also be seen.
  Oesophagitis
Inflammation of the oesophagus usually presents with severe pain on swallowing (odynophagia). There are many different aetiologies but there are a few features which can help separate the differential diagnoses on imaging.

Patients taking medication without enough water immediately prior to going to bed
Idiopathic eosinophilic oesophagitis
History of atopy usually present
Specific ring-like indentations to the oesophagus
  Glycogen acanthosis
This condition is caused by benign age-related squamous hyperplasia but, based on its imaging features, a differential diagnosis for candidiasis. On a barium swallow there will be small rounded white plaques in a random distribution, predominantly affecting the middle and upper oesophagus. Patients are typically middle aged or elderly.
  Intramural pseudodiverticulosis
This is a feature of candidal oesophagitis. Tiny diverticulae are found scattered along the length of the oesophagus and on a barium swallow the appearance can be quite impressive! Like most candidal infections oesophagitis is most common in patients with suppressed immunity including patients with diabetes, on steroids, or chemotherapy.",FALSE,"I chose 1, 3, and 5 because they are all symptoms that are associated with Barrett oesophagitis. Irregular longitudinal plaques in the upper half of the oesophagus, multiple small ulcers each surrounded by a radiolucent halo, and an ulcer in the mid oesophagus at the aortic impression are all indicative of the condition.",2,"3.

Please note that the question asks which is NOT a contraindication.
Intussusception usually affects infants between the ages of 3 months and 3 years. The Ileocolic type is the most common, followed by ileo-ileocolic. It is important to consider lead points: HSP, Meckel’s diverticulum and duplication cysts are all possibilities. Another important facet to this condition is the management of intussusception. Reduction using a fluoroscopic-guided air/CO2 enema (rather than barium) reduces the risk of faecal peritonitis and is the preferred management. The risk of perforation with this method is thought to be around 0.5%. Free air on plain film and clinical peritonitis are contraindications to pneumatic reduction by air enema.
Although long intussusceptions, lack of bowel wall vascularity and an extended duration of symptoms are not favourable features, perforation is the only absolute contraindication here.

14583,205825,You are reviewing a cardiac MRI scan which shows a mass in the left atrium. It returns low signal on T1 and T2 images and does not enhance. What is the most likely diagnosis? Select ONE answer only.,SBA: Cardiothoracic and vascular,Atrial thrombus,Atrial myxoma,Cardiac sarcoma,Cardiac metastasis,Papillary fibroelastoma,A,70%,13%,1%,1%,16%,"Explanation:
Atrial thrombus
The usual site for an atrial thrombus would be the left atrial appendage. Thrombi are not seen as mobile masses but as irregular lobulated masses. They can have a laminated appearance and the classical feature is low signal on gradient-echo MRI sequences owing to the presence of haemosiderin (blooming artefact). They do not enhance. Ventricular thrombi can form too, it is usually a sequela of a previous myocardial infarction which has healed leaving a hypomobile portion of the ventricular wall. Adjacent to that part of wall there is relative stasis sufficient to facilitate thrombus formation.
  Atrial myxoma
These are the most common benign neoplasms of the heart. Although usually sporadic, they can occur as part of Carney syndrome (atrial myxoma, facial/buccal pigmentation, sertoli tumours of the testis and multiple other findings. Not to be confused with Carney triad - pulmonary hamartomas, gastric leiomyosarcomas and extra-adrenal paragangliomas). The finding of a small mass attached to the interatrial septum by a stalk is classical. Their mobility allows some to prolapse through the relevant atrioventricular valve during the cardiac cycle. They can act as a focus for platelet aggregation leading to systemic emboli for the more common left sided masses or pulmonary emboli for right sided myxomas. Iso or hypointensity on T1w MRI is typical.
  Carney Triad Carney Syndrome
1. Pulmonary harmatoma Atrial myxoma
2. Gastric leiomyosarcoma (GIST) Facial/ buccal pigmentation
3. Extra-adrenal paraganglioma
Sertoli tumour of the testis
Pituitary adenoma
  Papillary fibroelastoma
These tumours are rare even for cardiac tumours but yet are the most common cardiac tumour to be associated with the valves. Rather counter-intuitively, they do not cause valvular dysfunction. They are usually quite small and, like myxomas, relatively mobile, attached by a stalk, and able to prolapse through a valve but where myxomas usually arise from the interatrial septum, papillary fibroelastomas grow from the valve itself. Histopathologically they are gelatinous tumours resembling sea anemones with multiple papillary projections. They can act as a focus for platelet aggregation leading to systemic emboli for left sided masses or pulmonary emboli for right sided masses. On MRI they are often low in signal on T2 weighted sequences owing to their fibrous nature.
  Cardiac sarcoma
There are many different types of cardiac sarcoma. Cardiac sarcomas are the most common cause of primary malignant cardiac tumours. Their presentation usually relates either to embolic phenomena such as TIAs or symptoms from invasion such as pericardial effusion. In contrast to myxomas or fibroelastomas, malignant lesions tend to have a broad attachment to the heart wall. Another useful differentiating feature on imaging is the involvement of more than one chamber of the heart.
  Cardiac metastases
Metastases are significantly more common than cardiac sarcomas meaning metastases are the most common malignant cardiac tumours. In contrast to myxomas or fibroelastomas, malignant lesions tend to have a broad attachment to the heart wall. Tumours can be from lung or breast cancer, lymphoma, leukaemia and malignant melanoma.",FALSE,"Atrial myxoma is the most likely diagnosis because it is the most common benign tumor of the heart, and it typically presents as a low signal mass on T1 and T2 images that does not enhance.",2,,B,TRUE,,A,TRUE,A
14481,205825,A 40-year-old man is brought to the Emergency Deparment following a road traffic incident. He is found to have sustained a vertebral artery dissection. Which of the following is NOT a complication of this condition? Select ONE answer only.,SBA: Central Nervous and Head & Neck,Subacute combined degeneration of the cord,Subarachnoid haemorrhage,Horner syndrome,Lateral medullary syndrome,Spinal cord infarction,A,72%,18%,7%,2%,2%,"Explanation:
A post-traumatic vertebral artery dissection classically presents as a third nerve palsy and cerebellar signs. The ‘sickle sign’ or ‘fried egg’ sign refers to the appearance of T1 fat saturated sequences where a slice transverse through the vessel shows hyperintensity in a crescenteric or circumferential shape to the wall of the affected vessel. Unlike large vessel dissections the anatomy here is usually too small to see a dissection flap.
  Subacute combined degeneration
This is a curious condition which can be subtle to detect. A deficiency of vitamin B12 (usually caused by malabsorption) leads to degeneration within the dorsal columns of the cord. The dorsal columns carry nerves responsible for position and vibration sense and as such patients present with loss of these senses as well as sensory ataxia (balance significantly deteriorates when the patients’ eyes are shut thereby excluding visual stabilisation as opposed to sensory stabilisation), and hyperreflexia.
On an MRI scan there will be (if the resolution allows), a longitudinal line of high T2 signal within the cord on sagittal sequences, and often a characteristic 'inverted-V' shape of high T2 signal on axial sequences. In some cases, the 'V' is clearly seen and in others it is harder to appreciate and the finding is more of high T2 signal bilaterally and symmetrically in the region of the posterior columns.

  Spinal cord infarction
The vascular supply to the spinal cord is derived largely from the vertebral arteries or intercostal arteries with one longitudinal running anterior spinal cord artery and two small longitudinally running posterior spinal cord arteries.
The artery of Adamkiewicz is a particularly large segmental artery supplying the anterior spinal artery from around the level of T9. It is responsible for most of the spinal cord blood supply for the lumbar spinal cord. Damage during aortic surgery or trauma can result in spinal cord infarction.
Usually any vascular insult results in a reasonably rapid onset of symptoms. Spinal cord infarctions are no exception. Often more than one vertebral level is affected.
An MRI will show T2 hyperintensity of at least the central grey matter (if not the whole cross-section of the cord) due to oedema. As with intracranial infarctions there will be restriction of diffusion on the DWI sequences.
Particularly in the thoracic spine, the adjacent vertebral body may also lose its blood supply and undergo infarction.
  Lateral Medullary Syndrome (Wallenburg syndrome)
This is caused by either a vertebral artery occlusion or PICA occlusion and is one of those syndromes that is far more common in exams than in real life. There is a short list of slightly unusual symptoms any combination of which, in the exam context, should make you suspicious for this syndrome:
Cerebellar involvement – DANISH mnemonic
Autonomic dysfunction – ipsilateral Horners syndrome, hiccoughs
Sensory symptoms – symptoms of sensory loss are commonplace in the stroke world but in this syndrome it is specifically loss of pain and temperature sensation in the ipsilateral face and contralaterally in the rest of the body. Patients can also experience ipsilateral stabbing pains; pain symptoms are highly unusual in the stroke world and usually point to a different diagnosis.
Ipsilateral bulbar symptoms – dysphagia, dysarthria etc.

Hepatoblastoma
This is the most common primary liver tumour in infants under the age of 5. It is associated with Beckwith-Wiedemann Syndrome and prematurity. Most hepatoblastomas are found in children under the age of 3 but they can occur at any point in childhood. They are the third most common abdominal tumour in children. Presentation is typically with an abdominal mass and weight loss and the serum AFP is often markedly elevated. Some may produce hormones and thereby precocious puberty but this is rare. Coarse calcification is seen in around a third of cases. On ultrasound the mass will be large and heterogenous. On CT they appear as a predominantly low attenuation mass seeming to consist of multiple confluent nodules. Often the rim of the mass enhances well on CT.

14192,205825,A 65-year-old man undergoes a CT Aortogram following a diagnosis of an infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm picked up during screening. The CT scan shows an incidental lesion in the pancreatic tail. It is well defined and low in attenuation and shows high uptake on RBC labelled NM scan. What is the most likely diagnosis? Select ONE answer only.,SBA: Gastrointestinal,Splenunculus,Pseudoaneurysm,Mucinous cystadenoma,Serous cystadenoma,Lymph node,A,86%,7%,3%,2%,1%,"Explanation:
Accessory spleens or splenunculi are relatively common (30% of patients) and can usually be found close to the splenic hilum or tail of the pancreas. They follow the spleen on all modalities and should not be mistaken for intra-abdominal lymph nodes. Rarely they can be found apparently within the pancreas and are misdiagnosed as neuroendocrine tumours since they share similar imaging characteristics.
RBC Technetium labelled scan
During this scan the patient is injected with stannous phosphate which enters the red blood cells and primes them for labelling with technetium. After 20 minutes, 20ml of blood is taken out and combined with Tc99m pertechnetate. The blood is then heated to around 50oC for 35mins and then re-injected. The red blood cells damaged by this process are filtered out of the circulation by any normally functioning splenic tissue within the body.
Absence of uptake on imaging is consistent with asplenia.
An alternative scan which can also be performed is a Tc99m sulphur colloid scan.
Splenosis
When there has been trauma to the spleen, tiny fragments can migrate around the peritoneal cavity, attach to structures and grow into larger collections of splenic tissue. On imaging these behave exactly as you would expect the normal spleen to for each modality. They can cause confusion if they are mistaken for peritoneal deposits.
Splenic variants
Rarely (<1% of patients) the spleen can migrate from its usual position and end up virtually anywhere else within the abdominal cavity. This is of no clinical consequence unless the consequently long and tortuous vessels supplying it become compromised by torsion or the patient undergoes abdominal surgery. On imaging the wandered spleen should exhibit the usual characteristics of a normally positioned spleen but if there is any doubt as to the diagnosis confirmation with a 99mTc-sulphur-colloid scan can be sought.
Polysplenia is a condition which arises as part of left-sided isomerism (also known as heterotaxy). In Left-sided isomerism all of the features which would usually be found on the left side of the body are found on both, or right sided features are found on the left side (such as the liver). Vice versa is true for right-sided isomerism. Right-sided isomerism usually presents earlier on due to the greater complexity of associated cardiac abnormalities.",FALSE,"Serous cystadenoma is the most likely diagnosis for a well-defined, low-attenuation lesion in the pancreatic tail that shows high uptake on RBC labelled NM scan.

14297,205825,A 48-year-old man presents to the Emergency Department complaining of headache. He is reviewed by an Emergency doctor who finds he also has a bitemporal hemianopia. She refers him to a Neurology consultant. An MRI scan shows high signal in the region of the sella on T1 and T1 fat saturated sequences. What is the most likely diagnosis? Select ONE answer only.,SBA: Central Nervous and Head & Neck,Pitutary apoplexy,Rathke cyst,Sarcoidosis,Craniopharyngioma,Lymphophysitic hypophysitis,A,53%,22%,1%,19%,5%,"Explanation:
Pituitary apoplexy
Pathologically, pituitary apoplexy is infarction which can take place with or without haemorrhage. Over half of patients have an underlying macroadenoma; haemorrhage into a pre-existing macroadenoma is the usual presentation. 'All' patients present with a headache and panhypopituitarism. Visual impairment is also common as the pituitary enlarges and impacts on the chiasm. On a CT scan there will be a sellar/suprasellar mass (ie pituitary enlargement). Hyperdensity is caused by the underlying haemorrhage, if present. On an MRI, the pituitary can be seen to be enlarged with T1 hyperintensity (specifically in the subacute phases). In the chronic phase however, the pituitary will be involuted and small, even appearing as an 'empty sella'.
Sheehan syndrome is pituitary apoplexy due to hypovolaemic shock and can be consequential to delivery. At the time of apoplexy, the predominant issue for the patient is the systemic hypovolaemia for which aggressive management is usually already being pursued. In the early days following the delivery, the first hypopituitary issues to manifest is usually any or all of hyponatraemia, diabetes insipidus or hypothyroidism. At this time the MRI findings can vary from a normal appearing pituitary through to the classic pituitary apoplexy appearances of an enlarged pituitary with high T1 signal. Patients can also present many months or years later with panhypoituitarism at which time an MRI will usually show an empty sella.
  Rathke cleft cyst
The location of this lesion, if it can be appreciated, is the giveaway feature; between the anterior and posterior pituitary, even in the absence of any other features which would be noted on the scan but which have not been provided and which would usually be used to eliminated any further doubt as to the diagnosis. Rathke's cleft cyst is classically hyperbright on T2. The lack of symptoms is also a key feature which points away from several of the other diagnoses given. Microadenomas are below 10mm in size, but 80% return low signal on T1 weighted sequences. Craniopharyngiomas are usually lobulated, often contain cystic and calcified areas. Pathologically the appearance of the cholesterol-rich components gives rise to a classical 'machinery oil' type appearance of craniopharyngiomas.
  Craniopharyngioma
Craniopharyngiomas was previously thought to have a bimodal age distribution with a peaks at around age 12 and age 50. The two different age distributions actually represent different tumour types with overlapping features. In children these are adamantinomatous craniopharyngiomas and in adults they are papillary craniopharyngiomas. Both present with symptoms attributable to their sella/suprasella location. In children this includes growth retardation due to compression of the hypothalamus. Calcification is more common in the paediatric group. Avid enhancement post-gadolinium is a good differentiating feature from Rathke cleft cysts which will only show mural enhancement. Adenomas enhance variably. Adenomas can also show cystic degeneration.",FALSE,"Craniopharyngioma is the most likely diagnosis because it is the most common cause of high signal intensity in the region of the sella on T1 and T1 fat saturated sequences. This type of tumor is most commonly found in individuals aged 10-50 and is usually located near the pituitary gland, which is why it is a common cause of bitemporal hemianopia.",2,,D,FALSE,,B,FALSE,D

Bony contusions
Bruising to the bone can be detected around 2 days following an injury but may not resolve for many months thereafter. With regards knee injuries, it is often possible to discern the mechanism of injury from the pattern of bruising seen. The contusions follow fluid on MRI scans i.e. low in signal on T1 and high on T2 (and STIR). STIR is used to suppress the fat of the bone marrow thereby making the fluid stand out more.
  Clip injury and pivot shift injury
- High signal on STIR to the lateral femoral condyle and posterolateral tibial plateau with an associated tear of the anterior cruciate ligament tear (Pivot shift)
- High T2 signal to the anterior aspect of the lateral femoral condyle and lateral tibial plateau with an anterior cruciate ligament and medial collateral ligament tear (Clip injury)
These two injuries are very similar. Both involve valgus stress on a flexed knee (such as a tackle to the knee during sports). A pivot shift injury also requires external rotation of the tibia. The three main structures most at risk during these injuries are:
Anterior cruciate ligament (especially in a pivot shift injury)
Medial collateral ligament (especially in a clip injury)
Medial meniscus (remember that the medial meniscus is attached to the medial collateral ligament)
If all three are present together it is referred to as the O’Donoghue triad. Since O’Donoghue defined this triad however, it has been discovered that lateral meniscal tears are actually more common with this type of injury than medial meniscus ones.
Bony contusions occur at the side of impact because the proximal tibia and distal femur impact on one another thus:
Lateral tibial plateau (posterolateral in pivot shift injury)
Lateral femoral condyle
  Transient lateral patella dislocation injury - High signal on T2 to the lateral femoral condyle and medial patella facet with an associated tear of the medial retinaculum
When the patella dislocates laterally, its medial facet can impact onto the anterolateral corner of the lateral femoral condyle. Both areas become damaged and contusions can be seen on MRI. Often though, the patella reduces spontaneously and thus the exact mechanism of injury must be inferred from the imaging findings.
Joint effusion
Osteochondral injuries to the anterolateral femoral condyle and medial patella facet
Sprain or disruption to the medial retinaculum
  Hyperextension injury - High signal on T2 and STIR to the anterior aspect of the tibia with an associated anterior cruciate ligament tear
These occur often following excessively forceful kicking. There will be bony contusions at the anterior aspect of the tibial plateau and femoral condyles. Either of the anterior or posterior cruciate ligaments may also be involved.
  Dashboard injury - High STIR signal to the anterior aspect of the tibia with an associated posterior cruciate ligament tear
As the name would suggest, this injury is usually stained by impact of the knee against the dashboard of a car during a road traffic incident. Force applied to the anterior aspect of the tibia when the knee is flexed leads to:
Osteochondral injury or fracture to the anterior aspect of the tibia
Posterior cruciate ligament rupture/sprain",FALSE,"Answer: 4. High T2 signal to the anterior aspect of the lateral femoral condyle and lateral tibial plateau with an anterior cruciate ligament and medial collateral ligament tear.

  IOTA rules (International Ovarian Tumour Analysis)
In comparison to many other cancers, ovarian cancer has a relatively poor prognosis, partly on account of the vague nature of symptoms leading to presentation but also due to the limitations of diagnosis by ultrasound (often the first line of investigation for patients who end up being diagnosed with ovarian cancer).
The IOTA rules were designed to standardise ultrasound findings in ovarian lesions.
Two sets of rules were drawn up; M-rules and B-rules (indicating malignant and benign characteristics respectively). The rules have been designed to be as simple as possible, for general use by anyone capable of performing transabdominal or transvaginal imaging of the ovaries.
  Malignant = One or more M-rule, no B-rules
Benign = One or more B-rules, no M-rules
Indeterminate = everything else
  B-rules
M-rules
B1 = Unilocular cyst
M1 = Solid, irregular mass
B2 = <7mm solid component
M2 = Ascites
B3 = Acoustic shadow 
M3 = >3 papillary structures
B4 = Multilocular cyst <10cm
M4 = Multilocular solid mass >10cm
B5 = No blood flow
M5 = Blood flow
    Ovarian cancer
There are a number of different types of ovarian carcinoma and the final diagnosis will be a histological one. On imaging the features can be varied.
Subtypes Frequency and Age
Malignant epithelial tumours (Serous, mucinous, endometroid, clear cell) 85% (60s -70s)
Malignant germ cell tumours (Teratoma, dysgerminoma, choriocarcinoma, mixed) 7% (<30 years)
Metastases <10%
Sex cord stromal tumours ~5%
  A number of factors increase the risk of developing ovarian cancer in an individual. Anything which increases the number of ovulatory cycles a woman undergoes in her lifetime will increase the risk of ovarian cancer (early menarche, late menopause, nulliparity), and vice versa (multiparity, breastfeeding, oral contraceptive pill use). A family history of related cancers also increases the risk.
Presenting symptoms may be quite vague with abdominal pains, constipation or urinary frequency being the only complaints if any from the patient. Consequently, many tumours have already spread beyond the ovary by the time of diagnosis. Initial investigation is often with ultrasound. Although ovarian cancers can have a variety of imaging appearances, solid or papillary components to a cystic mass are strongly indicative of malignancy. Predominantly solid masses with some small cystic components are also likely to be malignant but completely perfectly solid lesions are actually more likely to be benign. Ovarian fibromas and fibrothecomas are both benign lesions which can be seen as solid masses however despite this, without prior imaging for comparison a solid ovarian lesion is malignant until proven otherwise.
Ovarian cancer can spread in a multitude of ways:
Direct extension Sigmoid mesocolon, broad ligament, fallopian tubes
Intraperitoneal seeding and implantation Omental caking, peritoneal space
Lymphatic spread External iliac, obturator nodes
Haematogenous Liver, lung, adrenal glands, pleural effusion

Femoroacetabular impingement (FAI)
Mixed type - >80% of patients have components of both cam-type and pincer-type FAI.
Cam type - a cam is an engineering term for an oval/egg shaped component with a hole through the middle of the wider end. In cam type FAI the femoral head takes on a 'cam' shaped appearance due to bony overgrowth at the superior aspect of the femoral neck. This abnormal bony contour impinges against the anterosuperior aspect of the acetabulum during movement. The condition occurs more frequently in men and tends to affect men in their 30s. Certain conditions can predispose to cam-type FAI, including SUFE, DDH and Perthes disease. Some patients with cam-type FAI exhibit femoral retroversion.
Pincer type - here bony protuberance of the anterosuperior acetabulum causes over-coverage of the femoral head and impingement against the femoral neck. Protrusio acetabuli predisposes to pincer-type FAI. The relationship of the overgrown anterior acetabular rim to the posterior acetabular rim in pincer-type FAI is called acetabular retroversion since it causes the femoral neck to twist posteriorly. Patients usually stand with their toes pointing outwards as a consequence. The condition is more common in women and a patient is typically aged around 40.",TRUE,"Cam-type femoroacetabular impingement is the most likely diagnosis due to the roundness of the superior aspect of the femoral neck.

IgG4 related diseases are one of Radiology’s newest entities. They comprise a constellation of fibrotic conditions affecting virtually every part of the body, mediated by a subclass of Immunoglobulin called IgG4. Where one condition exists others may also be present. The more common of these include:
Autoimmune pancreatitis (most common manifestation)
Orbital pseudotumour
Fibrosing mediastinitis
Riedel thyroiditis
Sclerosing mesenteritis
Retroperitoneal fibrosis
  Specific to sclerosing mesenteritis is the ‘fat-halo’ sign (aka fat-ring sign) where there is misty mesenteric soft tissue density fat stranding but the fat immediately adjacent to the mesenteric vessels is spared.
Serum IgG4 levels are usually (but not always) elevated in patients with IgG4 related disease, and this should be the first test performed. Patients can respond extremely well to corticosteroid therapy.
  Autoimmune pancreatitis
The main role of imaging is to exclude malignant pathology. The typical appearance is of a diffusely enlarged 'sausage-shaped' pancreas. Enhancement may be slightly delayed owing to the degree of fibrotic change and on duct-imaging (ERCP, MRCP), benign strictures of the pancreatic ducts may be appreciated. The duct-penetrating sign is used to differentiate these from malignant strictures; if the duct traverses an area of concern then malignancy is unlikely. In a malignant stricture the duct will be occluded. The pancreatic duct is usually narrowed although some mild upstream dilatation may be present as a result of stricturing. Biopsy and pathological confirmation of the diagnosis can be helpful if deemed necessary but the combination of typical CT findings, elevated serum IgG4 levels and response to corticosteroids is often sufficient. Ca19-9 levels may also be elevated and so do not help differentiated the condition from the presence of a neoplastic lesion.",FALSE,"I chose this answer because autoimmune pancreatitis is characterized by a dilated pancreatic duct, which is usually seen on a CT scan.

  Scaphoid Non-Union Advanced collapse (SNAC)
This occurs following a scaphoid fracture. It is similar to SLAC but there is a normal scapholunate distance, with a scaphoid fracture. Like SLAC, there is radioscaphoid degenerative change, followed by proximal migration of the capitate and eventually dorsal intercalated instability.
  Scaphoid-lunate advanced collapse (SLAC)
This occurs following injury to the scapholunate ligament or secondary to CPPD. It is similar to SNAC but there is scapholunate widening, rather than a scaphoid fracture. Radioscaphoid degenerative changes are an early feature, followed by proximal migration of the capitate and eventually dorsal intercalated instability.
  Avascular necrosis (AVN) of the scaphoid
This is usually secondary to a proximal fracture. The most reliable sign is low T1 signal in the scaphoid.
  Midcarpal dislocation
This occurs in association with triquetral fracture and is very similar to lunate dislocation.",FALSE,"Scaphoid-lunate advanced collapse (SLAC) is the best description of this abnormality because it describes the widening of the scapholunate distance, which is seen on the radiographs with the scapholunate angle of 20 degrees.

13835,205825,A 21-year-old man with a significant family history of sudden cardiac death presents with collapse. An electrocardiogram performed in the Emergency Department demonstrates a left bundle branch block. An echocardiogram demonstrates a dilated right ventricle. A cardiac MRI scan is performed which identifies high T1 and T2 signal in the thickened right ventricular free wall. Fat-saturated sequences show signal loss within the right ventricular wall. The left ventricle appears normal. What is the most likely diagnosis?,SBA: Cardiothoracic and vascular,Arrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Cardiomyopathy (ARVC),Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy,Sarcoidosis,Amyloidosis,Right ventricular myxoma,A,83%,9%,1%,3%,4%,"Explanation:
Arrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Cardiomyopathy (ARVC)
There is a familial preponderance in around 50% of cases. Resultant arrhythmias are usually LBBB or ventricular tachycardia. There is fibro-fatty degeneration of the right ventricular wall as well as right ventricular dilatation.
  Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy
This is characterised by non-dilated thickening of the ventricular wall. If it is associated with left ventricular outflow obstruction, it can have a grave prognosis. This is due to a venturi effect pulling the anterior leaflet of the mitral valve into the outflow tract (SAM - systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve).
  Sarcoidosis
Usually gives high T2 signal in the midwall, affecting predominantly the septal base. It can mimic focal hypertrophic cardiomyopathy due to focal wall thickening from oedema. It does not tend to affect the right ventricle.
  Amyloidosis
Diffuse subendocardial gadolinium enhancement and diffusely increased T1 myocardial signal are the classical features.
  Cardiac myxoma
Myxomas commonly affect the atrium (left atrium usually). They are the most common cardiac primary tumour in adults. They are usually attached the inter-atrial septum and demonstrate post-gadolinium enhancement.",TRUE,"The most likely diagnosis is Arrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Cardiomyopathy (ARVC) due to the findings on the cardiac MRI scan, which demonstrated high T1 and T2 signal in the thickened right ventricular free wall, as well as signal loss in the fat-saturated sequences.

Disseminated pneumocystitis causes cortical necrosis and calcification, similar to disseminated MAI. The other conditions are associated with medullary nephrocalcinosis. Incidentally, medullary nephrocalcinosis is 20 times more common than cortical nephrocalcinosis.
The most common cause of nephrocalcinosis is hyperparathyroidism (followed closely by renal tubular acidosis). Ehler Danlos syndrome and Beckwith-Weidman (as well as Caroli disease) are associated with medullary sponge kidney (which should always be considered if there is unilateral medullary nephrocalcinosis.

14049,205825,A 50-year-old hepatitis C positive man with known cirrhosis undergoes MRI liver for further investigation of a liver lesion detected on screening ultrasound. A 3 cm well-defined lesion is low on both T1 and T2 compared to background liver. It demonstrates no arterial enhancement or washout in comparison to the background liver. What is the most likely diagnosis? Select ONE answer only.,SBA: Gastrointestinal,Regenerative nodule,Hepatocellular carcinoma,Haemangioma,Liver cyst,Dysplastic nodule,A,77%,2%,1%,3%,17%,"Explanation:
Liver cysts and haemangiomas are both unlikely in the cirrhotic liver. They are both T2 bright.
Regenerative/ siderotic nodule - Contains iron. Dark on T1, dark on T2 and does NOT enhance.
Dysplastic nodule - T1 bright, T2 dark, contains fat and glycoprotein. Sometimes enhance arterially but do not washout (particularly low grade dysplastic nodules).
HCC - T2 bright, arterially enhances with washout. Washout is the key differentiator from a low grade dysplastic nodule. As the dysplasia becomes increasingly high grade, and finally frankly neoplastic, contrast washout becomes more pronounced.
  Cirrhosis
Cirrhosis is characterised by three entities: fibrosis, regeneration and architectural distortion. The many different causes of cirrhosis all lead to hepatic fibrosis. Where islands of normal tissue remain in amongst the fibrosis there is regeneration and the formation of new nodules of normal liver tissue distort the previous architecture of the liver. Caudate lobe hypertrophy is also often present in cirrhosis, reflecting the fact that the blood supply for the caudate lobe receives most of its blood from the hepatic artery and is therefore slightly protected from the toxins causing the underlying cirrhosis.
Regenerative nodules – These are present in the thousands in a cirrhotic liver. Often they are tiny (<3mm) or small (>3mm) but solitary larger nodules can also be seen measuring a few centimetres in diameter. They are hyperplastic in nature, and most run a benign course however some can become dysplastic and thereafter, neoplastic and are therefore important to note. On imaging they follow the characteristics of normal liver but may therefore be visible against the background of a cirrhotic liver.
Siderotic nodules – sometimes regenerative nodules have an increased iron content than would normally be expected for liver. The iron leads to spin dephasing on MRI and thus returns very little signal on all sequences. Where a siderotic nodule has become dysplastic it is therefore very difficult to establish this on MRI. On CT the nodules appear slightly dense.",TRUE,"I chose this answer because regenerative nodules are the most common type of liver lesion found in patients with cirrhosis. They typically have a well-defined margin and are low on both T1 and T2 compared to surrounding liver tissue. They also do not demonstrate arterial enhancement or washout in comparison to the background liver, which is consistent with the findings in this case.",2,,C,FALSE,,E,FALSE,E

Cortical contusions would be the main alternative theory however these are usually located cortically since they are caused by the impact of the brain on the skull.
Cerebral amyloid angiopathy does give rise to micro-haemorrhages at the grey-white matter junction but it is usually found in a far more elderly population, is seen on MRI as opposed to CT, and would be unrelated to trauma.
Neurocisticercosis is an infection caused by taenia solium which in its fourth stage can cause widespread cerebral calcifications.
Cavernomas can be incidental findings or can present with haemorrhage. They are usually associated with calcification (classically described as popcorn calcification).",TRUE,"Diffuse axonal injury is a form of traumatic brain injury that is caused by a severe acceleration or deceleration of the head, often seen in motor vehicle accidents.

14136,205825,An 85-year-old man is undergoing pre-operative assessment prior to a routine TURP procedure for some troublesome lower urinary tract symptoms. When his PSA is found to be markedly elevated he undergoes an MRI scan for further investigation. Which of the following regarding prostate cancer in the transitional zone is correct? Select ONE answer only.,"SBA: Genito urinary, Adrenal, Obstetrics & Gynaecology and Breast",They are usually organ-confined at presentation,Around 70% of prostate cancers occur in the transitional zone,They can be easily distinguished from BPH changes,A negative trans-rectal biopsy is reassuring,A non-circumscribed low T2 lesion is most likely to be BPH,A,79%,6%,3%,4%,8%,"Explanation:
Transitional zone cancers are less common than peripheral zone cancers but do occur and account for around 30% of prostate cancers. They are often harder to detect clinically due to their central location, and can be occult on imaging owing to overlap and confusion, in particular in patients with benign prostatic hypertrophy since it is the transitional zone which is involved in BPH. BPH leads to a heterogenous and enlarged appearance to the transitional zone which can obscure smaller lesions. On the plus side however, they are more often organ-confined since their central location effectively cushions them from capsular breach for longer. Their central location within the prostate cancer does however mean that trans-rectal biopsies may be falsely reassuring if negative, having missed the lesion due to lesion-depth within the prostate. Clinicians should have a low threshold for repeat-biopsies.
Peripheral zone
The highest grade of suspicion for malignancy in the peripheral zone is indicated by the presence of marked restricted diffusion (focal high b-value and corresponding low ADC signal), with a PIRADS 5 lesion being one that is greater than 1.5 cm. PIRADS 3 lesions will show some restricted diffusion but this is far less (subjective analysis) than for PIRADS 4 lesions. Dynamic contrast enhancement is used for assessment of peripheral zone lesions only - differentiating between lesions which show only limited restricted diffusion. If there is dynamic contrast enhancement with a type 3 washout curve, the lesion becomes a PIRADS 4 lesion despite the only limited restriction in diffusion.
Transitional zone
The highest grade of suspicion for transitional zone lesions is reserved for moderate T2 lesion which is lenticular or non-circumscribed and moderately T2 hypointense (PIRADS 5 >1.5 cm).
Three plane T2 imaging is common practice and enables full assessment of the peripheral zone of the prostate, particularly examining for extra-capsular extension, bladder base or seminal vesical invasion. T2 is also the most important sequence for lesions in the transitional zone.
The T1 weighted sequences are also useful to check for the presence of any haemorrhagic foci although since most patients now undergo their MRI scan prior to any biopsies being taken this has become far less important.
Interestingly the ADC map is more sensitive for carcinoma of the prostate (in the peripheral zone) than the DWI sequences. A finding of focal low signal on the ADC map may be seen in the absence of a corresponding high DWI focus. In the transitional zone however, the T2 sequences are more sensitive.",FALSE,"I chose this answer because it is true that prostate cancers in the transitional zone can be easily distinguished from BPH changes. This is because prostate cancers in the transitional zone are usually more aggressive than BPH changes and can be identified through a physical examination and imaging tests such as an MRI scan. BPH changes, on the other hand, are usually benign and can be identified through a physical examination, but imaging tests are usually not necessary.",1,"3.

Please note the question asks for the LEAST likely source.
  Fresh PR bleeding is far more likely to be colonic than deriving from the fore or midgut.
The gastroduodenal artery arises from the common hepatic artery, a main branch of the celiac axis

The middle colic artery is a branch of the SMA
The ileocolic artery constitutes the distal main branch of the SMA
The left colic artery is the first branch of the IMA",FALSE,The middle colic artery is not a likely source of the bleeding because it is located too far away from the site of the bleeding.

The differential diagnosis of a posterior mediastinal mass is an important one to know. The key features in this question are the lung infarct and H-shaped vertebra which indicate an underlying diagnosis of sickle cell disease.
  Extramedullary haematompoesis
Coarse bone trabeculations and an adjacent posterior mediastinal mass are key to the diagnosis. Extramedullary hematopoiesis can be found in multiple organ systems, but most commonly the liver, spleen and lymph nodes. Lesions are FDG avid on a PET-CTscan.
  Neuroenteric cyst
This would be a cystic lesion and is often associated with spinal anomalies (E.g. hemivertebrae) and therefore scoliosis.

14167,206687,A 24-year-old man undergoes an x-ray of his right knee which shows a small effusion despite a normal joint space. He goes on to have an MRI and is subsequently diagnosed with PVNS. Which of the following is most likely to have been seen on the MRI? Select ONE answer only.,SBA: Musculoskeletal and Trauma,Frond-like proliferation of the synovium with low T1 and T2 signal,Frond-like proliferation of the synovium with high T1 and T2 signal,Nodular synovial thickening with subchondral cyst formation,Nodular synovial thickening with low T1 and T2 signal,Nodular synovial thickening with high T1 and T2 signal,A,48%,9%,3%,35%,5%,"Explanation:
PVNS - Pigmented villonodular synovitis
The classic joint to be affected by PVNS is the knee but it can also occur at other large joints. Usually only one joint is affected in each patient. On x-ray the only sign may be a large joint effusion. Large subchondral cysts can also be seen. On MRI however, the appearances are characteristic. Haemorrhagic proliferation of the synovium in a frond-like villonodular fashion gives rise to the classic low signal 'feathery' sea-anemone-like finding. On susceptibility weighted sequences there is blooming artefact owing to the presence of haemosiderin. Patients are usually middle-aged and treatment is with synovectomy although there is a high rate of recurrence.
If the patient is male, the usual differential diagnosis for PVNS is of haemophilic arthropathy owing to the presence of blood products there too. PVNS appears as a differential diagnosis for subarticular lucent bone lesions due to the formation of large subchondral cysts.
  Lipoma arborescens
This condition can affect children or adults and is thought to be a reaction to chronic inflammation of the synovium leading to extensive fatty infiltration of the synovium. It is almost always the knee which is affected. Plain radiographs will show only an effusion, which may be large, but on MRI there is frond-like or nodular synovial proliferation which returns fat-signal according to the different sequences used. The signal should be high on T1 and T2 but suppress on fat-saturated sequences. Post-contrast the synovium itself will enhance. Treatment is by synovectomy.
  Rheumatoid arthritis
A joint effusion and synovial thickening (which would avidly enhance post-contrast) is a worthy description for rheumatoid arthritis however the high-fatty signal of the synovium is not a feature of rheumatoid arthritis. As the condition develops, patients with rheumatoid arthritis exhibit erosive changes with cartilage loss, bony erosions and marrow oedema.
  Haemophilic arthropathy
The larger joints are most at risk for this disease, and the knee is particularly classical. On an xray there may only be a joint effusion in early disease but erosions and subchondral cysts develop. In particular there may be widening of the intercondylar notch (for which there is a differential diagnosis of: JIA/RA, Psoriatic arthropathy, TB and haemophilia) due to pannus formation.  Also classical is epiphyseal overgrowth secondary to hyperaemia.
  On an MRI there may well be nodular deposits on the synovium however the presence of blood degradation products renders these very low in signal on all sequences with blooming artefact present on gradient echo sequences or similar. If a haemarthrosis is present, the signal of the fluid will change depending on the chronicity of the event.
  A haemophilic pseudotumour occurs in around 1-2% of patients with haemophilia. The presence of blood degradation products leads to a wide variety of intralesional signal patterns. The lesions are usually surrounded by a low signal haemosiderin rim though. Lesions can arise within bone (intra-osseous) or in soft tissues (usually muscular). Growth and pressure effects on adjacent bone can cause scalloping.
 ",FALSE,I chose 5 because nodular synovial thickening with high T1 and T2 signal is a common finding in PVNS (Pigmented Villonodular Synovitis).

11501,206687,A 65-year-old man is found to have an abdominal aortic aneurysm when he undergoes an ultrasound scan as part of the national screening service. He is followed up with a CT scan which also shows that he has no kidney on his right side. His left kidney measures 18cm in length. Review of the ultrasound images shows no interpolar notch. What is the diagnosis?,"SBA: Genito urinary, Adrenal, Obstetrics & Gynaecology and Breast",Right renal agenesis and left renal hypertrophy,Horseshoe kidney,Crossed fused ectopia,Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome,Prune belly syndrome,A,63%,4%,31%,2%,1%,"Explanation:
Renal agenesis
Agenesis is associated with many chromosomal aberrations including the trisomies and Turner syndrome. Additionally it is seen in conjunction with Mullerian duct anomalies, VACTERL anomalies and many others. Bilateral renal agenesis results in Potter sequence (oligohydramnios, pulmonary hypoplasia) and is currently incompatible with life. Unilateral renal agenesis results in compensatory hypertrophy of the remaining kidney and care must be taken therefore, not to mistake the condition for crossed fused renal ectopia which some sources say is more common.
  Crossed fused renal ectopia 
Crossed renal ectopia occurs when both kidneys ascend on one side during embryological development. In crossed fused renal ectopia they are fused as well. Like horseshoe kidney it is a malformation which is twice as commonly seen in men as in women. The condition can be complicated by infections and stones. An ultrasound will show an apparently enlarged single kidney although careful examination reveals a notch between two distinct kidneys which have fused. Angiography is necessary prior to any surgical intervention owing to the propensity for vascular aberrancy of morphologically abnormal kidneys.
  Horseshoe kidney
When the kidneys are fused at the poles they fail to ascend properly during development, meeting resistance at the inferior mesenteric artery. In 90% of cases it is the lower poles which have fused leading to the classical horseshoe appearance. The ureters course anteriorly over the fused portion and are prone to reflux. The anterior displacement of the fused kidneys renders them susceptible to damage from abdominal trauma whereas, by comparison, kidneys in their usual location are protected by the lower ribs. Horseshoe kidneys are twice as commonly seen in men as in women and have numerous associations, chiefly genitourinary in nature but also, notably, trisomy. The giveaway description on imaging is of medially orientated renal long axes in addition to the anterior course followed by both ureters. Horseshoe kidney may be an incidental diagnosis but since patients are at greater risk of developing urinary tract infections, calculi, and transitional cell carcinoma, presentation may relate to one of these.
  Prune Belly Syndrome also known as Eagle-Barrett syndrome
This is a triad of:
Abdominal wall muscle deficiency
Distension of the distal ureters +/- hydronephrosis
Bilateral cryptorchidism
Despite the final element to the triad the condition can occur in girls but is far less common. There is a multitude of associations spanning all the other body systems which can occur in conjunction with this disease. Around one third of babies die within the first 24 months but where renal function is less affected the prognosis is much better.
  Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome also known as EMG syndrome (Exomphalos, Macroglossia, Gigantism)
This curious condition crops up in a number of different radiology circles. It is caused by a mutation on chromosome 11 and leads to a specific set of clinical manifestations, chief among them are the three which give it the alternative name of EMG syndrome. Malrotation of the small intestine is another feature which has a high concordance with this condition.",TRUE,"I chose 2 because right renal agenesis and left renal hypertrophy are the most likely diagnoses given the information provided.

What is the most likely aetiology of this stricture?",SBA: Gastrointestinal,Achalasia,Squamous cell carcinoma,Barrett oesophagus,Leiomyoma,Aberrant right subclavian artery,A,98%,1%,1%,0%,0%,"Explanation:
Achalasia
This is a motility disorder which causes a failure of relaxation of the gastro-oesophageal junction (GOJ) and disorganisation of oesophageal peristalsis. Ingested material (including barium during fluoroscopy) is held up at the GOJ in a column. On a barium study the column has a classical bird-beak tapering point at the inferior-most end where it reaches the GOJ. There is often then sudden emptying of the oesophagus due to eventual pressure on the GOJ exceeding its strength. Oesophageal contractions may be absent or may be non-peristaltic. On a CXR an air-fluid level may be seen behind the heart.
  Oesophageal leiomyoma
Leiomyomas are said to be the only oesophageal lesions which can calcify. Generally, the absence of any shouldering of a stricture is a benign feature. Leiomyomas tend to arise in relatively young patients and are more common in the mid or distal thirds of the oesophagus. Ulceration is a very uncommon feature.
  Oesophageal carcinoma
Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the oesophagus predominantly affects the middle and lower thirds of the oesophagus and accounts for around 60% of oesophageal malignancies. Adenocarcinoma arises in the lower third, mostly in areas of Barrett oesophagus, and accounts for most of the remaining 40%. Some patients develop symptoms of dysphagia and retrosternal pain but sadly many tumours remain occult until they are at an advanced stage. This is in-part due to the fact that there is no serosal layer protecting the oesophagus and as such cancers can progress rapidly. Patients found to have Barrett oesophagus (metaplasia of the usual squamous epithelium to columnar epithelium) are screened frequently for adenocarcinoma.
Aberrant right subclavian artery
This common anomaly occurs when instead of being the first major branch of the aorta (technically the first branches are the coronary arteries), the right subclavian artery arises distal to the left subclavian artery. It then has to swerve back around to reach the right side and in doing so usually runs posterior to the oesophagus, which can be seen on a barium study as a smooth indentation. In some cases it can exert sufficient pressure on the oesophagus to cause dysphagia which is termed dysphagia lusoria.
An aberrant left pulmonary artery is the ‘only’ vascular anomaly to run between the oesophagus and the trachea. There are cases of aberrancy of the right pulmonary artery in the literature however these patients tend to die in infancy.
An anterior indentation of the oesophagus is caused by:
An aberrant left pulmonary artery

A right sided arch with an aberrant left subclavian artery
A left sided arch with an aberrant right sided subclavian artery
A double aortic arch – this is usually described as also causing an anterior indentation to the trachea",TRUE,"Achalasia is the most likely aetiology of the stricture observed in the barium swallow because it is a disorder of the muscles of the lower esophageal sphincter, causing it to remain closed and not relax properly.

Anatomy is the key to differentiating between the various female urogenital cysts most of which are, for the most part, asymptomatic incidental findings.

  Gartner duct cyst
These are usually found incidentally on MRI scans but can cause dyspareunia.  They do not communicate with the urethra and would be unlikely to cause post-void dribbling. They are remnants of the Wolffian ducts and occur superiorly in the anterolateral wall of the vagina. On imaging they appear straightforwardly cystic. For the most part they occur sporadically but they can also be seen in conjunction with renal agenesis or ectopia and are also typical of a rare condition called Herlyn-Werner-Wunderlich syndrome. This condition causes duplication of all or part of the female genital tract with unilateral haematometrocolpos and ipsilateral renal agenesis. 
  Urethral diverticulum also known as urethrocoele
Dysuria, dyspareunia and post-void dribbling are classical for this condition. An outpouching of the urethral mucosa protrudes through the smooth muscle. This is seen on MRI as high T2 signal adjacent to or surrounding the urethra. Urinary stasis within the diverticulum predisposes patients to the formation of calculi, which can be seen as low signal on the T2 scan, and adenocarcinoma which will enhance with gadolinium.
  Skene duct cyst
These are retention cysts of the paraurethral ducts and usually they are asymptomatic. On MRI they are seen inferior to the pubic symphysis but lateral to the external urethral meatus. Signal characteristics reflect their cystic nature with high T2 signal but fluid-fluid levels may also be present if there has been intracystic haemorrhage.
  Bartholin gland cyst
The bartholin glands secrete lubricating fluid into the inferior third of the vagina. They are found in highest numbers at the posterolateral aspect of the inferior vagina. Although usually asymptomatic, when infected or inflamed a Bartholin gland cyst can present as a painful lump. On MRI they show as high T1 signal owing to the mucoid fluid.
  Nabothian cyst
These are tiny (few millimetres) mucous retention cysts located on the cervix. They are reasonably common but largely asymptomatic. They appear straightforwardly cystic on MRI.",FALSE,"I chose this answer because Bartholin gland cysts are the most common cause of dyspareunia in young women.

Anatomy plays a strong role in the correct diagnosis of male genitourinary tract cysts. It is first necessary to differentiate between intraprostatic cysts and extraprostatic cysts.
  Mullerian duct cyst (intraprostatic)
These are usually found in young adult men and are also caused by incomplete regression of the Mullerian duct. They have numerous similarities with prostatic utricle cysts, including an association with renal agenesis (although not with intersex disorders). Anatomically they are also posterior to the bladder however unlike prostatic utricle cysts they extend superiorly to the prostate and do not communicate with the urethra. On MRI they appear straightforwardly cystic unless complicated by infection. The shape of the cyst is said to be teardrop shaped rather than the pear-shaped prostatic utricle cysts.
    Mullerian duct cyst Prostatic utricle cyst
Age 20-40 years 0-20 years
Shape Teardrop Pear
Extends above prostate? Yes No
Communicates with prostatic urethra? No Yes
  Prostatic utricle cyst (intraprostatic)
These are found in teenagers or adolescents and represent incomplete regression of the Mullerian duct system during embryological development. They are found posterior to the bladder, within the prostate, and do not extend any more superiorly than the superior most aspect of the prostate. This anatomical detail and the fact that the cyst does communicate with the prostatic urethra sets it apart from a Mullerian duct cyst on imaging. They can cause all manner of lower urinary tract symptoms and boast an association with ipsilateral renal agenesis as well as intersex disorders. On MRI they are said to have a pear-shaped appearance.",FALSE,"I chose this answer because a Mullerian duct cyst is typically found in the intraprostatic location, meaning it is located within the prostate.

11266,206687,A 35-year-old lady is being investigated for primary subfertility. She has had four early miscarriages. She undergoes a hysterosalpingogram (HSG) which shows an abnormality. She goes on to have an MRI scan for further clarification. There are two separate uterine cavities the limbs of which are widely divergent and there is a prominent fundal cleft with a depth of at least 2cm. Two separate cervices and vaginal cavities can be seen. What is the most likely diagnosis?,"SBA: Genito urinary, Adrenal, Obstetrics & Gynaecology and Breast","Bicornuate, bicollis uterus",Bicornuate unicollis uterus,Arcuate uterus,Septate uterus,Mayer-Rokitansky-Kuster-Hauser (MRKH) syndrome,A,88%,2%,1%,5%,5%,"Explanation:
Mullerian duct anomalies (MDA)
The two Mullerian ducts form separately then fuse in the first trimester to form all the structures between the upper vagina and the fallopian tubes. The final part of the amalgamation of the two sides is resorption of the central uterine septum. There are various classification systems the scope of which is subspecialist. The following is provided for a gross overview only. Different anomalies occur depending on when during development the disruption to normality occurred.
      Aplasia/hypoplasia anomalies
Class I – Agenesis or hypoplasia:
Mayer-Rokitansky-Kuster-Hauser (MRKH) syndrome is an extreme subtype where there is complete aplasia of the upper third of the vagina and uterus. The fallopian tubes and ovaries will be seen normally. Primary amenorrhoea is the usual presentation.
Class II – Unicornuate: Banana like configuration of the remaining horn
  Fusion anomalies
Class III - Didelphys: Non-fusion, two separate uterine horns, two separate cervices. All of the walls contain all of the layers of the normal uterus. The uterine cavities do not communicate with one another owing to the presence of a vaginal septum.
Class IV – Bicornuate: partial fusion, the septum separating the two horns consists of myometrium. There can be either one or two cervices depending on the degree of fusion but crucially the two uterine cavities do communicate with one another. Sometimes the appearance of a bicornuate uterus is referred to as ‘heart-shaped’. In a quarter of cases a longitudinal vaginal septum means that the case is easily confused with a didelphys anomaly.
  Reabsorption (of uterine septum) anomalies
Class V – Septate: partial fusion, a fibrous remnant septum remains. This is the most common anomaly presenting as infertility.
Class VI – Arcuate: a mild form of septate uterus but which is not associated with subfertility.
The crucial diagnosis to make is that of a septate uterus. Patients with a septate uterus can present with recurrent mid-term miscarriages due to implantation on the suboptimally vascularised septum. Surgical resection of this septum can significantly improve fertility chances. Distinguishing between didelphys and bicollis bicornuate uteri can be very challenging and is beyond the scope of this text.
There is no association with abnormalities of the external genitalia or ovaries since these derive from different embryological components but renal anomalies (agenesis, ectopia, fusion) can be found in around a third of patients and should be actively sought. Infertility is the primary clinical consequence of an MDA.
  Hysterosalpingogram (HSG)
HSGs are performed in the setting of infertility to confirm or refute tubal patency. It is not the ideal modality to diagnose MDAs since it provides information only on the internal contours of any patent cavities. Historically the intercornual angle was used to differentiate between a septate uterus (<75o) and a bicornuate or didelphys uterus (>105o) but this is no longer considered reliable. In addition an HSG will overlook obstructed hemisystems or functional remnants which do not communicate with the vagina.
  Ultrasound
Differentiating between fusion anomalies (bicornuate and didelphys) and reabsorption anomalies (septate and arcuate) depends on the fundal contour. Usually this can be well seen on ultrasound. Where there has been a failure of complete fusion a fundal cleft remains. This should be at least 1cm deep. If the patient has a septate or arcuate uterus then fusion is complete so the fundus will be domed as is normal. A normal dome is greater than 5 mm high.
  MRI
MRI is considered the gold standard for evaluating cases of MDA. The presence of menstrual blood products within an obstructed hemi uterus is, where present, readily seen as high signal on T1. Where a patient has two cervices these can be seen appearing like two ‘owl eyes’ when imaged axially to the vagina.
  Diethylstilbestrol (DES) exposure
DES was an artificial oestrogen used to treat women suffering from recurrent miscarriages. Owing to an association with clear cell carcinoma of the vagina and cervix its use was halted in the 1970s. It also caused shortening of the upper segment of the uterus which gave rise to a very characteristic T-shaped uterine cavity as seen on HSG. This was classed as a Class VII type of MDA.
Pertinent points:
Renal agenesis, ectopia and fusion present in 33% of patients
Aplastic uterus + normal fallopian tubes and ovaries = MRKH syndrome
Widely divergent horns + fundal cleft = fusion anomaly (didelphys or bicornuate)
Two cervices also known as owl eyes on MRI = either didelphys or bicollis bicornuate (difficult to tell them apart)
No communication between two uterine horns = didelphys
Domed fundus = reabsorption anomaly (Septate or arcuate)
Recurrent midterm miscarriages can be due to septate uterus and can be surgically resected to improve fertility.",FALSE,"I chose 2, Bicornuate unicollis uterus, as the most likely diagnosis because this is the most common abnormality seen on an MRI scan of the uterus in cases of primary subfertility. The characteristics described in the question are consistent with bicornuate unicollis uterus, which is characterized by two separate uterine cavities, widely divergent limbs, and a prominent fundal cleft with a depth of at least 2cm. Furthermore, bicornuate unicollis uterus is associated with recurrent miscarriages, which is consistent with this patient's history.",2,,B,TRUE,,A,FALSE,D

When this fails to demonstrate an underlying colonic malignancy or foregut malignancy a CT scan is requested. The CT scan shows multiple enlarged low attenuation lymph nodes throughout the abdomen. There are fat-fluid levels within the nodes. With the exception of an atrophic spleen the remainder of the scan is normal.  What is the most likely diagnosis?",SBA: Gastrointestinal,Coeliac disease,Tuberculosis,Whipple disease,Lymphoma,Necrotic lymph node metastases,A,56%,8%,26%,4%,7%,"Explanation:
Differential diagnosis for lymph nodes of low attenuation
Coeliac disease – cavitating mesenteric lymph node syndrome
Tuberculosis
Whipple disease
Lymphoma
Necrotic metastases
  Within the differential diagnosis for lymph nodes of low attenuation, the presence of fat-fluid levels is a reasonably specific sign for cavitating mesenteric lymph node syndrome.
  Coeliac disease
Luminal sensitivity to gluten leads to autoimmune mediated atrophy of villi within the small bowel. Iron deficiency anaemia, malabsorption and deficiency of the fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E and K) result. Classically on imaging there is jejunisation of the ileum (ie an increased number of ileal folds and a decreased number of jejunal folds) which is a reasonably specific sign to coeliac disease. Importantly however the fold thickness is not increased, in contrast to many of the possible differential diagnoses. On historic fluoroscopic examinations flocculation, segmentation are supposed to be typical and result from hypersecretion of fluid however modern barium preparations are less susceptible to these effects. The moulage sign (complete loss of jejunal folds such that the bowel wall appears smooth) is also quoted. A rare complication is cavitating mesenteric lymph node syndrome where lymph nodes within the small bowel mesentry show low attenuation on CT and characteristically have fat-fluid levels. In such cases the spleen may also be atrophic.",FALSE,"I chose this answer because the CT scan findings are most consistent with necrotic lymph node metastases. The presence of multiple enlarged low attenuation lymph nodes with fat-fluid levels suggests that the nodes have necrotic material within them, which is a common finding in metastatic disease. The absence of other findings on the CT scan such as enlarged organs or masses also supports the diagnosis of metastatic disease.",2,,D,FALSE,,C,FALSE,E

It measures 20HU on the unenhanced sequence, 75HU on the portal venous phase and 38HU on the delayed sequences. You may use a calculator. What is the absolute washout of this lesion?","SBA: Genito urinary, Adrenal, Obstetrics & Gynaecology and Breast",67%,49%,73%,47%,32%,A,77%,7%,7%,4%,6%,"Explanation:
Figures have been rounded to the nearest whole number.
Absolute washout = (75-38)/(75-20) = 67%
Relative washout = (75-38)/75 = 49%
    This lesion is a benign adrenal adenoma. In many centres, if the lesion measures less than 10HU on the unenhanced sequence then the study will be terminated at that point.
  Adrenal washout
Washout characteristics of adrenal nodules help confirm or refute a diagnosis of an adrenal adenoma. The absolute washout takes into account the initial uptake of contrast whereas the relative washout calculation is based only on how well contrast washes out of a nodule.
The underpinning principle is that vasculature within malignant lesions is more permeable than in benign lesions. This allows contrast to diffuse out of the lesion during the portal venous phase and the contrast is then slower to wash out during the delayed phase than it would be for benign lesions. Thus the higher/faster washout characteristics (either absolute or relative) the more suggestive it is that a lesion is benign.
    Adrenal adenoma
These present a diagnostic challenge if only to rule out a malignant adrenal mass. Once the diagnosis is confirmed they can then be left alone and do not require any further imaging. The majority are obvious on CT and obviously adenomas. Owing to their high fat content most adenomas show low Hounsfield units (HU) an HU <18 on an unenhanced study has a sensitivity of 85% and a specificity of 100%.
In cases where the fat content is insufficient to make the diagnosis an adrenal protocol CT can be performed. This compares the HU on an unenhanced scan, a portal venous phase scan and a 15 minute delayed phase scan. From these values the absolute washout can be calculated by comparing the difference between the two contrast studies with the amount of contrast taken up in the first place (i.e. the difference between the portal venous phase and the unenhanced phase). The relative washout is calculated by comparing the difference between the two contrast studies to just the portal venous phase (i.e. it is relative to the portal venous phase).
An alternative diagnostic strategy which, but for demand management, is better for patients as far as dose preservation is concerned, is an MRI scan. The fat content of adrenal adenomas shows up well as signal loss on out-of-phase imaging and gives a chemical shift artefact in the frequency encoding direction on both gradient echo and spin echo sequences.  On gradient echo sequences due to the chemical shift a black line appears in all directions and is termed the India Ink effect or etching artefact.
  Diagnostic of adrenal adenoma:

<18 HU (100% specific)
<37 HU on a delayed scan

Chemical shift on GE and SE MRI",FALSE,"The absolute washout of this lesion is calculated by subtracting the HU value on the delayed sequences from the HU value on the portal venous phase and dividing it by the HU value on the portal venous phase.

This is the most common abdominal mass in children under the age of 8. There are reasonably strong associations with renal anomalies, genital anomalies, aniridia and Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (although the last of these also has an association with neuroblastoma). Presentation is usually with an abdominal mass and/or pain.

  On imaging the masses are usually heterogenous. Cystic areas can often be seen secondary to areas of necrosis. The claw sign occurs when there is a rim of normal renal tissue extending part of the way around the mass. A Wilms tumour is often described as enhancing but less so than the adjacent normal renal parenchyma.
  Neuroblastoma
This is the most common solid abdominal mass in infants and second most common in children of all ages (after Wilms tumours). Most are adrenal in location, around a third develop in the retroperitoneum and a fifth are located in the posterior mediastinum. Presentation can be with abdominal pain, a mass, or a fever. Most (95%) secrete catecholamines such as VMA (vanillylmandelic acid – leads to hypertension) or VIP (vasoactive intestinal polypeptides – leads to watery diarrhoea). There are also a few distinct clinical syndromes which herald the presence of a neuroblastoma.
  Syndrome
Details
Blueberry muffin syndrome
Metastatic cutaneous deposits
Opsomyoclonus
Rapid jerky eye movements and myoclonic jerks of the legs. This occurs in around 2% of neuroblastoma cases but around 50% of patients with opsomyoclonus have a neuroblastoma.
Hutchinson syndrome
Limping due to bony metastases
  On imaging they appear as a very large abdominal mass with or without speckled calcification within in. The kidney can either be invaded or just displaced inferiorly, causing a ‘drooping lily’ appearance on urography (where contrast within the inferiorly displaced renal calyces has the appearance of a lily flower with its head hanging down). Neuroblastomas tend to encase large vessels such as the IVC, as opposed to displacing them as Wilms tumours are prone to doing. Staging is performed with an 123I-MIBG scan (as opposed to a 99mTc-MDP bone scan) and importantly within the staging it is actually stage IVs (disease involving the skin, bone marrow and liver) which has the best prognosis.

  Multicystic dysplastic kidney
A Multicystic Dysplastic kidney is the second most common cause of a neonatal abdominal mass. The normal renal architecture is entirely replaced by a non-functioning mass of cysts separated from one another by fibrous tissue. The overall appearance is said to resemble a bunch of grapes. If unilateral, the condition can be asymptomatic or can present as recurrent urinary tract infections. The most important distinction to make is from hydronephrosis which is overall the most common cause of a neonatal abdominal mass. In hydronephrosis the apparent 'cysts' will communicate whereas in multicystic dysplastic kidney the cysts are separate from one another.

  Mesoblastic nephroma
This is the most common solid mass in a neonate and 90% of them are diagnosed within the first year of life. Presentation is usually as an abdominal mass. On ultrasound there will be a large hypoechoic renal mass which cannot clearly be separated from the normal renal parenchyma. Pertinent negative imaging features of note are the lack of invasion into the collecting system and lack of venous invasion, the latter in particular helps to differentiate it from a WIlms tumour.
  Multilocular cystic nephroma
There are two age peaks for this tumour; one at around age 4 which affects mostly boys and and one at around age 40 which affects mostly women. In young boys the most common presentation is of a painless abdominal mass with or without other features such as haematuria and urinary tract infections. On ultrasound there will be a mass of cysts but importantly they will be surrounded by a thick fibrous capsule. Protrusion into the renal pelvis is also a key finding, but this is also seen in some WIlms tumours.

13771,206687,An 8-month-old girl is referred by the health visitor with developmental delay and regression. Her head size is normal but an MRI demonstrates diffuse white matter abnormalities with a stripey ‘tigroid’ appearance. An MR SPECT study reveals a normal NAA peak What is the most likely diagnosis?,SBA: Paediatrics,Metachromatic leukodystrophy,Fabry disease,Adrenoleukodystrophy,Canavans Disease,Alexanders Disease,A,74%,5%,9%,8%,4%,"Explanation:
This distribution is classical for Metachromatic leukodystrophy which is the most common leukodystrophy and gives a ‘tigroid’ appearance.
Adrenoleukodystrophy usually affects older children around 5-10 years and occurs only in boys; demyelination usually commences in the occipital lobes, progressing anteriorly.
Canavans disease is associated with an elevated NAA peak and macrocephaly in a child under 12 months of age; the pattern of involvement is also more classically diffuse, particularly affecting the subcortical U-fibres.
Alexander disease affects children less than one, who also classically have an enlarged head, but the pattern of distribution is usually localised to the frontal white matter.
Fabry disease is an X-linked multisystem disorder that neurologically presents in adults with diffuse white matter T2 hyperintensity and small vessel disease.",FALSE,"Canavan disease is a rare, inherited, degenerative neurological disorder that is most commonly seen in infants and young children.

14931,206687,You are performing an ultrasound scan on a 13-year-old girl who was taken by her mother to the GP with a breast lump. On examination there is a small lump on the left side measuring approximately 2cm in diameter. The ultrasound shows this to be oval with some slight posterior acoustic shadowing. What is the most likely diagnosis?,"SBA: Genito urinary, Adrenal, Obstetrics & Gynaecology and Breast",Asymmetric breast tissue,Galactocoele,Phyllodes tumour,Fibroadenoma,Cyst,A,29%,1%,3%,59%,7%,"Explanation:
Posterior acoustic shadowing occurs in fibroadenomas but is usually florid if present, owing to the presence of the classical popcorn calcification. By contrast, a breast cyst would produce posterior acoustic enhancement.
At this age the most likely diagnosis, given the description, is asymmetry of the breast tissue. Fat necrosis, a common finding in this age group, could also give a similar appearance.
  Fibroadenoma
Popcorn calcification is pathognomonic of a fibroadenoma. They tend to be nodular or lobulated in contour but with smooth margins. They often show a ‘halo’ sign of low attenuation where tissue surrounding the lesion has been compressed. Patients are usually relatively young; 20s or 30s.
  A phyllodes tumour 
These would typically be described as having a similar appearance to a fibroadenoma. They would usually appear as a lobulated round hypoechoic mass with ill-defined borders and a posterior acoustic shadow. Occasionally they can demonstrate a ‘halo’ sign. Patients are usually middle aged, slightly older than those with a fibroadenoma.
  Galactocoele
A galactocoele appears during lactation as an enlarging painless mass. A fat-fluid level is a specific finding on a lateral view. These lesions would be far more likely to be ultrasound diagnoses than mammographic. They can have a variety of appearances, ranging from cystic with internal debris, to solid appearing masses. Posterior acoustic is an important feature which suggests a fluid component to the mass. Diagnosis is typically confirmed by aspirating milk from the lesion.",FALSE,"Fibroadenomas are the most common benign breast lumps found in adolescent girls. The ultrasound findings of an oval shaped lump with slight posterior acoustic shadowing are consistent with a fibroadenoma.

On examination the girl’s temperature is 37.5oC, her knees are both slightly swollen and tender with a reduced range of movement bilaterally. An x-ray is requested which shows soft tissue swelling, juxta-articular osteopenia and periosteal reactions affecting both knees. What is the most likely diagnosis?",SBA: Paediatrics,Juvenile idiopathic arthritis,Legg-Calve-Perthes disease,Transient synovitis,Septic arthritis,Osteoid osteoma,A,92%,1%,3%,3%,0%,"Explanation:
Juvenile idiopathic arthritis, (JIA) previously juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (JRA)
This is very similar to rheumatoid arthritis but occurs in patients below the age of 16. Patients present with joint stiffness and pains on waking. Fever and lymph node enlargement are also common. Technically, symptoms must have been present for at least six weeks for the diagnosis to be made. Unlike rheumatoid arthritis it is the large joints which are affected early on with subsequent involvement of the little joints of the hands and feet. On x-ray there will be periarticular osteoporosis but the increased perfusion of the epiphyses as a result of inflammation leads to overgrowth, early fusion and overall bone shortening. Erosions and destruction of the joint can be severe, even resembling a neuropathic joint.
  Legg-Calve-Perthes disease
Avascular necrosis of the femoral head can occur spontaneously, particularly in young (2-12 years, although usually 4-8 years) Caucasian boys. It is named Legg-Calve-Perthes disease and often referred to only as Perthes disease. Avascular necrosis of the femoral head secondary to sickle cell disease, leukaemia or steroid use is not technically Perthes disease.

  Perthes disease is best appreciated on a frog-leg lateral view and this view must always be included in a series when investigating for the disease and the disease should always be considered in patients presenting with a painful limp. Of the early changes, ipsilateral demineralisation is the least consistent with Perthes disease. The presence of a radiolucent crescent shaped subchondral fracture has an even lower incidence but is also not seen until late on in the disease. The goal of imaging is to identify patients early before they reach this stage.
On MRI there will be a ‘double-line’ sign on T2 with sclerotic/necrotic bone returning little signal but the granulation tissue returning high signal. The bone marrow becomes low on T1 and high on T2.
  Transient synovitis of the hip
This is the most common cause of an acute limp in a child and is usually preceded by a viral infection such as an upper respiratory tract infection. Patients may have a low-grade fever and around half have an elevated serum ESR but characteristically the x-rays will be normal with the possible exception of a joint effusion. The usual age-range is 5-10-year-olds.
  Septic arthritis
Septic arthritis in any age group is a surgical emergency and the joint must be washed out as soon as feasible in order to avoid irreversible joint damage caused. Clinical suspicious must therefore be high, not least because early x-rays may be normal. Initial investigation should be with ultrasound and echogenic debris may be found within a joint effusion. The diagnosis is confirmed by aspiration of purulent joint fluid. The condition can also be readily appreciable on MRI which is very sensitive for early joint damage. Synovial oedema can be seen as high signal on T2 with enhancement post-gadolinium on T1 fat saturated sequences.

These are small benign tumours but which can be quite symptomatic, classically with pain relieved by aspirin. The majority form in the diaphyses of long bones but the posterior elements of the spine is another classic location.
The radiolucent nidus and symptoms of night pain in a young patient point to either an osteoid osteoma or an osteoblastoma. The final diagnosis comes down to size. <1.5 cm is definitely an osteoid osteoma, and >2 cm is definitely an osteoblastoma. There is a nasty grey area somewhere between the two sizes.
On x-ray the radiolucent nidus may not be fully appreciated and the abnormality which is picked up will be the consequential sclerotic solid periosteal reaction. In the spine there may be a painful scoliosis concave towards the lesion as a result of adjacent muscular spasm.

Aside from the fracture you also notice that all of the bones included in the films appear densely sclerotic. The medullary cavity is not visible on the images. A previous view of his lumbar spine reveals a bone-within-a-bone appearance to the vertebra. What is the most likely diagnosis?,SBA: Musculoskeletal and Trauma,Osteopetrosis,Osteopoikilosis,Osteopathia striata,Pyknodysostosis,Melorheostosis,A,88%,3%,2%,5%,2%,"Explanation:
Osteopetrosis
This is a disease of abnormal osteoclastic activity which leads to thick, sclerotic bone throughout the skeleton. Although appearing very solid on an x-ray, the bone is very disorganised structurally and consequently very brittle. Patients may experience numerous fractures throughout their lives. There is an autosomal dominant form which does not impede life expectancy but the autosomal recessive form carries are poorer prognosis with death due to complications of bone marrow failure (infections, leukaemia or haemorrhage) before adulthood.
On x-ray there is a generalised increase in bone density and films should be carefully evaluated for the presence of a pathological fracture. A bone-within-a-bone appearance is typical of the autosomal dominant form and there may be alternating lines of sclerosis and lucency in the phalanges.
Osteopetrosis

  Pyknodysostosis
This disorder is inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion and causes diffuse bony sclerosis. Patients are of short stature and often have a typical facies; there is usually frontal bossing despite delayed closure of the cranial sutures, small mandibular size and beaking of the nose. Additionally patients have short stubby fingers, the nails of which may be hypoplastic. It can be difficult to tell pyknodysostosis from osteopetrosis however the medullary cavity is still discernible in the case of pyknodysostosis. Patients with osteopetrosis also do not tend to suffer from short stature or mandibular involvement.
Osteopoikilosis
This benign condition leads to multiple small oval bone islands forming around the skeleton. Purportedly, once the epiphyses have fused the number remains static. They can show mildly increased uptake on a nuclear medicine bone scan. Whereas a bone island may exist in isolation or near isolation, the finding of multiple such lesions suggests the diagnosis of osteopoikilosis.

  Osteopathia striata
This disease is more similar to osteopoikilosis than the other bony dysplasias. It is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion, but can arise sporadically too. It causes striking longitudinal striations in the metaphyseal regions of the long bones but patients are generally asymptomatic and it is usually therefore an incidental finding. The appearance is said to resemble stalks of celery.
Melorrheostosis
This dysplasia gives a classical appearance said to resemble the dripping of solid candle wax along a bone. The name comes from greek words meaning 'flowing' and 'limb'. It can be asymptomatic but if there is encroachment on nerves or joints patients may present with pain and movement limitations. Uniquely for a dysplasia, it can cross from one bone to the next across a joint, sometimes causing fusion in the process. On imaging the affected 'dripping' areas are seen as slcerotic areas within the affected bones. It usually only affects one limb of the patient but changes can be seen in more than one bone of that limb (i.e. monomelic but polyostotic).",TRUE,"Osteopetrosis is a rare genetic disorder that results in bones that are abnormally dense and thickened, which is consistent with the description of the patient's bones in the images. Additionally, the bone-within-a-bone appearance of the lumbar spine is a classic radiographic finding of osteopetrosis. In contrast, osteopathia striata, pyknodysostosis, and melorheostosis are all characterized by thin, fragile bones, which is not consistent with the description of the patient's bones in the images.

The abdominal lymph nodes can be broadly divided into pre-aortic and para-aortic groups, depending upon their relationship to the aorta.
The pre-aortic nodes lie anterior to the aorta and lie around the origins of the visceral (anterior) arteries. They drain the gastrointestinal tract and its accessory viscera (liver, spleen and pancreas). These nodes can be further divided into three groups, each lying near to the origins of their respective artery:
Coeliac lymph nodes
Superior mesenteric lymph nodes
Inferior mesenteric lymph nodes
  All of the efferent lymphatics from the pre-aortic nodes drain into the intestinal trunk, which in turn drains into the cisterna chlyi.

The biliary tract, or biliary tree, is a pathway through which bile that has been secreted by the liver is transported to the duodenum.
The biliary tract begins as the interlobular bile ducts form the right and left hepatic ducts. These two ducts merge to form the common hepatic duct, which is situated alongside the hepatic vein.
The common hepatic duct exits the liver and joins with the cystic duct from the gallbladder to form the common bile duct. The common bile duct is sometimes referred to as the ‘trunk of the biliary tree’ and together with the hepatic artery and hepatic portal vein forms the central axis of the portal triad.
The common bile duct passes downwards posteriorly to the proximal duodenum and joins with the pancreatic duct from the pancreas to form the ampulla of Vater. The ampulla of Vater opens into the duodenum and the release of bile at this point is controlled by a muscular valve called the sphincter of Oddi.

There is a large soft tissue density mass within the left lower lobe. A blood vessel can be seen connecting the mass to the descending thoracic aorta. The mass seems to have its own pleural lining. What is the most likely diagnosis?,SBA: Paediatrics,Extralobar sequestration,Intralobar sequestration,Congenital pulmonary airway malformation,Swyer-James syndrome,Bronchogenic cyst,A,86%,12%,1%,0%,0%,"Explanation:
Swyer-James syndrome
In this condition, normal development of the infant lung is impeded by bronchiolitis (viral or mycoplasma) at an early age, with superadded acute airspace destruction. Consequently the affected lobe is small and lucent on the CXR due to air trapping. It is a differential diagnosis for a unilateral lucent hemithorax, along with a pneumothorax, very large pulmonary emboli and causes of decreased chest wall musculature such as Poland syndrome or, historically, polio. In an an exam situation Swyer-James syndrome is usually given as a teenage or young adult patient with a history of recurrent LRTIs. Air trapping, and bronchiectasis can also be described.
  Bronchopulmonary foregut malformations:
CPAM
Sequestration
Duplication cysts (bronchogenic, neuroenteric, enteric)
  Congenital Pulmonary Airway Malformation (CPAM) – also known as Congenital cystic adenomatoid malformation (CCAM)
Although often an antenatal diagnosis, CPAM should be considered in the investigation of a neonatal respiratory distress. Milder cases can present later when the child develops a LRTI and decompensates. On investigation a cystic mass is discovered. The size of the cysts denotes the type with Type I accounting for half of cases and comprising a smaller number of larger (>20mm) cysts. Type III is more sponge-like with cysts measuring only a couple of mm and Type II is between the two. Where cysts are larger, air-fluid levels may be seen. The malformation can exert a mass effect, causing both hypoplasia of the remainder of the ipsilateral lung as well as contralateral mediastinal shift.
  Pulmonary sequestration
There are two types of pulmonary sequestration and two features which unite them. A segment of lung firstly, which derives its arterial blood supply from the systemic circulation and secondly, has no communication with the bronchial tree is termed pulmonary sequestration. It is a congenital abnormality and usually affects the left lower lobe with a smaller percentage affecting the right lower lobe.
Intralobar sequestration – This is more common (75%) but less severe. The affected segment does not have its own pleura and drains, like normal, via the pulmonary veins. Presents as recurrent pneumonias and is seen on a CXR as cysts with fluid levels. Some are associated with other congenital abnormalities but a larger proportion develop in isolation. A portion will contain air owing to communication via the pores of Kohn but they can also manifest as a soft tissue density mass.
Extralobar sequestration – This is less common (25%) and more severe with around half of patients suffering from other additional congenital anomalies. Venous drainage is via the systemic circulation, such as the IVC, and patients present in childhood either with respiratory distress due to shunting of blood or with symptoms attributed to the associated congenital anomalies (e.g. diaphragmatic hernia). The segment has its own pleura and therefore collateral air drift via the pores of Kohn cannot occur. The lack of aeration can help differentiate it from intralobar sequestration. Seen on a CXR as an opacity adjacent to the heart, abutting the diaphragm.

The main differential for a nasal mass is as follows:
  Squamous cell carcinoma
This is the most common malignancy of sinonasal track. The maxillary antrum is involved in 80% of cases. It is often seen as an aggressive antral soft tissue mass, which is low in signal on T2.
  Nasopharyngeal angiofibroma
This affects 'exclusively' adolescent male patients. There will be dark flow voids on T1 weighted sequences and the mass will be brightly enhancing. Radiation therapy treats this in 80% of cases, and interventional radiological embolisation can be used to treat haemorrhagic complications at presentation if required.
  Esthesioneuroblastoma
This tumour has a bimodal distribution, affecting people in their 20s and 60s. There is a dumbbell shaped tumour with waist at the cribriform plate. The mass will brightly enhance.
  Sinonasal lymphoma

Select ONE answer only.,SBA: Central Nervous and Head & Neck,Empty delta sign,Dense triangle sign,Bilateral haemorrhages,Subarachnoid haemorrhage,Bilateral infarctions,A,91%,7%,1%,0%,1%,"Explanation:
Static blood within the sagittal sinus gives rise to low signal on T1. Normally the sagittal sinus will appear as a flow void on T1w.
The empty delta sign is a post-contrast CT finding. Bilateral haemorrhages can be a secondary consequence to a sagittal sinus thrombosis which may point towards the diagnosis but the thrombosis itself is recognised by the empty delta sign on post-contrast CT.
Dense triangle sign pertains to the acute thrombus as it appears on an unenhanced CT scan.
On an MRI, static blood within the sagittal sinus gives rise to low signal on T1, although the thrombus itself is likely to be high in signal (if subacute in nature). Normally the sagittal sinus will appear as a flow void on T1w. Blooming artefact can be seen on T2* gradient echo sequences and is a strong indicatory of the diagnosis. Confusion can arise with time-of-flight 3D reformatted images and great care should be taken not to overdiagnose flow artefactas thrombosis. Careful reference should always be made to the source images and where there is doubt a CT venogram may be of more use.

This is slightly controversial since the absence of T1 marrow changes suggests that this patient actually has osteitis (if at all) rather than osteomyelitis (see below), however the location of the soft tissue changes being adjacent to a fifth MTP ulcer and the paucity of other joint involvement are strong pointers to an infective aetiology over Charcot arthropathy.

Osteomyelitis in a diabetic foot should definitely be suspected where there are marrow changes adjacent to an area of broken skin with soft tissue inflammatory changes in continuity with both the affected bone and the broken skin. Frank fluid collections (as opposed to either effusions or soft tissue oedema) also suggest infection over Charcot arthropathy. High T2 signal in the bone marrow is very sensitive for osteomyelitis and there should be a corresponding loss of normal high T1 signal too. If the T1 signal is normal, technically the finding may be of osteitis as opposed to osteomyelitis.
Changes can be seen on MRI prior to radiographic changes becoming apparent. Effusions are a prominent feature, and may be significant in size. Soft tissue oedema is also seen. Usually Charcot arthropathy affects multiple joints at once, and has a predilection for the mid-foot joints whereas osteomyelitis is more likely to affect an isolated joint, or be contiguous in nature from the index pathogen admission point; thus, the presence of an ulcer with adjacent inflammatory changes is far more suggestive of an infective process than a neuropathic one such as Charcot arthropathy.
  Charcot joint also known as neuropathic osteoarthropathy
In patients with advanced diabetes mellitus, Charcot arthropathy is usually seen in the midfoot or ankle joints. Although only a small number of Charcot joints affect the shoulder most of those caused by a syrinx do. A syrinx is also a more common cause of Charcot joints than either multiple sclerosis or Hansen disease (leprosy).
  Causes of Charcot joints
Diabetes mellitus
Syringomyelia
Hansen disease (leprosy)
Poliomyelitis
Neurosyphilis
Multiple sclerosis
  Whatever the underlying cause, compromise to the sensory nerves supplying the relevant joint prevent the normal protective mechanisms and as such minor trauma does not have sufficient an environment to heal correctly. This is particularly pertinent to weight-bearing joints. Loss of sympathetic control of the same area is also thought to play a part.
The joints can take either an atrophic pattern, a heterotropic pattern or a mixed pattern.
The radiological findings can be summarised as the 5Ds, namely:
Destruction
Dislocation
Density (due to heterotrophic new bone formation and sclerosis)
Disorganisation
Debris
  Characteristically there is no juxta-articular osteoporosis but joint effusions are common. In the case of the shoulder, the humeral head may be completely destroyed.
Atrophic Heterotrophic
More common Less common
Destruction predominates Fragmentation and debris formation predominates
Little sclerosis Much sclerosis
  Complex regional pain syndrome (also known as Sudeck dystrophy)
Patients develop chronic pain in an area previously affected by an, often disproportionately mild, injury. The pain is said to be burning in nature and symptoms of allodynia (pain with stimuli which would not normally be painful) and hyperalgesia (excessive sensitivity to pain) are also usually described. By contrast, reduced sensation is not normally found. On x-ray there is juxta-articular osteopenia with sub-periosteal bone resorption but preservation of the joint spaces. Soft tissue swelling can also be seen. Nuclear medicine tests may show either increased flow with increased uptake on the delayed blood pool images or (less commonly) decreased flow with decreased uptake on the delayed blood pool images.",FALSE,"The MRI scan findings of an ulcer overlying the fifth metatarsophalangeal joint, adjacent oedema in the soft tissues of the foot, and a joint effusion at the MTPJ are all indicative of Early Charcot arthropathy. Charcot arthropathy is caused by neuropathy leading to joint instability and destruction, which is often seen in diabetic patients. The other conditions listed are not consistent with the imaging findings.",2,,E,FALSE,,E,TRUE,A

The nerve supply of the lungs is derived from the pulmonary plexuses and features sympathetic, parasympathetic, and visceral afferent fibres:
The parasympathetic fibres of the lungs are derived from the vagus nerve. These serve to stimulate secretion from the bronchial glands, contraction of the bronchial smooth muscle, and vasodilatation of the pulmonary vessels.

13946,206687,You are performing an ultrasound scan on a 55-year-old man with a history of alcohol abuse.

What is the most likely diagnosis?,SBA: Gastrointestinal,Focal fatty sparing,Amiodarone therapy,Haemochromatosis,Diffuse steatosis,Wilson disease,A,92%,0%,0%,6%,0%,"Explanation:
Focal steatosis also known as focal fatty infiltration
The liver plays a small role in fat storage, and subtle variation in blood supply and drainage between different areas can lead to variations in the amount of fat in those areas. Focal fatty change is very common and has a geographic appearance on all imaging modalities, with a lack of mass effect (i.e. preservation of the vascular architecture). It can occur anywhere within the liver but is classically found adjacent to the falciform ligament (i.e. segments II, III and IV). Fat-identifying sequences on MRI can be very useful to confirm the diagnosis with signal drop out on out-of-phase images. Focal fatty sparing on the other hand appears as the inverse of this and on CT will be seen as isoattenuation on a background of a diffusely hypoattenuating liver. On ultrasound the liver will be diffusely hyperechoic when compared to the right kidney, and the spared area will be hypoechoic.
  Steatosis can be focal or diffuse. In this example of diffuse steatosis there is signal drop out in the whole of the liver on the out-of phase images:

    Haemochromatosis
The primary version of this disease can be inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion. Excess dietary iron is absorbed and this accumulates in all tissues of the body leading to various different problems.
Secondary haemochromatosis can arise if patients receive numerous blood transfusions without sufficient chelation to mitigate against the iron overload.
Cirrhosis – the presence of the excess iron in the liver leads to unusual signal properties on an MRI scan. Iron is paramagnetic and causes spin dephasing. T2* and T2 sequences are particularly vulnerable to this effect but lower than expected signal will be seen on all sequences. Importantly the signal from the spleen and bone marrow should be normal. By contrast they will be involved in cases of transfusional siderosis.
Generalised osteoporosis
Hook like osteophytes on the radial aspect of the metacarpal heads – these are highly characteristic
Chondrocalcinosis, particularly affecting the knees
Insulin dependent diabetes
Congestive cardiomyopathy
Skin pigmentation
  Wilson disease
Inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion, this disease results from an excess of copper within the body due to the inability of the liver to excrete it. It can present in childhood with cirrhosis but later presentations are more likely to be due to the neuropsychiatric manifestations. Clinically adolescent or adult patients develop tremor and dysarthria due to copper deposition in the lentiform nucleus. The classic diagnostic feature is Kayser-Fleischer pigment rings in the eyes. Radiologically the following features can be seen:
Hepatic manifestations: The liver appears normal on MRI since fatty infiltration effectively cancels out the paramagnetic effects of copper
Musculoskeletal manifestations: Generalised osteoporosis, subarticular cysts, chondrocalcinosis and arthropathy which can mimic CPPD
CNS manifestations: White matter atrophy and T2 hyperintensities predominantly affecting the basal ganglia and thalami. T1 signal is also high in these areas, differentiating it from many of the other basal ganglia disorders. There is a classical feature of ‘sparing of the red nucleus’ leading to an appearance known as the giant panda sign at the level of the pons.
  Amiodarone therapy
Amiodarone is an anti-arrhythmic drug which contains iodine (am-IOD-arone). Consequently, as it accumulates in the liver, it can cause significant increase in density to the liver on a CT scan. ",FALSE,"Diffuse steatosis is the most likely diagnosis in this case because it is the most common cause of diffusely hyperechoic livers in patients with a history of alcohol abuse. Additionally, the presence of a hypoechoic area adjacent to the gallbladder is consistent with the presence of fat deposits, which is a characteristic of diffuse steatosis.",2,,D,TRUE,,A,TRUE,B

  We can assume we are approaching such questions from the radiologist's perspective, namely when reporting a CT chest of a patient with no known primary, if there are lung metastases from where are they most likely to have come? It is therefore necessary to consider how prevalent a disease is in the whole population, as well as how often metastasis occurs for each cancer itself. For example you may be studying a cancer which very commonly metastasizes to the lungs and comparing it with one that rarely does so but if the former is incredibly rare and the later extremely common then the so-called frequency of lung metastasis may not be obvious.

There is no intracranial haemorrhage but you notice a destructive lesion involving the left side of the clivus. There is arc like calcification within it. What is the most likely diagnosis? Select ONE answer only.",SBA: Central Nervous and Head & Neck,Chondrosarcoma,Chordoma,Skull base metastasis,Multiple myeloma,Lymphoma,A,80%,16%,2%,1%,0%,"Explanation:
Chondrosarcoma
In some cases there can be a lot of overlap between clival chondrosarcomas and clival chordomas. If a mass is determindly off-midline however, a chondrosarcoma is far more likely. These arise from tiny remnants of cartilage in the synchondrosis between the petrous temporal bone laterally and the occipital bone medially. Patients may present with cranial neuropathies which would be less usual for a chordoma when the nerves traversing the petrous temporal bone are affected. The abducens (CN VI) nerve is most often affected and CN III, V, VII and VIII may also be involved.
Intralesional calcifications take the form of the classic 'arcs and rings' seen with chondrosarcomas elsewhere in the body. On an MRI scan the signal characteristics can be similar to a chordoma with isointensity on T1 to brain parenchyma and high T2 signal. Chondrosarcomas are also likely to enhance with contrast.
  Chordoma
These tumours are chiefly found in either the clivus or the sacrum. In the clivus they arise from the synchondrosis (primary cartilaginous joint) between the occipital bone inferiorly and the sphenoid bone superiorly. This is a midline joint and consequently the resultant chordoma is classically midline in nature. This helps to distinguish it from a chondrosarcoma which can appear very similar.
  Image © Medical Exam Prep
  Chordomas are aggressive, lobulated tumours which cause destruction of surrounding bone but lobulated mass effect on the pons with so-called 'thumbprinting' of the pons. Adjacent vascular structures, if not frankly invaded, are displaced. Posterior displacement of the basilar artery is a useful finding. Within the mass there are often calcific fragments representing either sequestered bone or dystrophic tumoral calcifications, or both. On an MRI scan the mass will be isointense to brain parenchyma on T1 and usually high in signal on T2. Most enhance with contrast.
  Skull base metastasis and multiple myeloma
A myelomatous or metastatic process must always be kept in the differential diagnosis for a skull base mass however this would be less usual (although obviously not impossible) in a patient without a known primary site or known disease. On an MRI scan there will be loss of the high T1 marrow signal, as with other aggressive bony lesions, however the T2 signal is usually low or isointense.",FALSE,"Chordoma is the most likely diagnosis because it is a slow-growing tumor that arises from remnants of the notochord, which is located in the clivus. This tumor is characterized by arc-like calcification, which is visible on the CT scan. Other possible diagnoses, such as skull base metastasis, multiple myeloma, lymphoma, and chondrosarcoma, usually do not present with arc-like calcification.",2,,B,FALSE,,B,FALSE,C

Select ONE answer only.,SBA: Musculoskeletal and Trauma,Scapholunate,Lunotriquetral,Capitolunate,Dorsal radiolunate,Extrinsic carpal ligaments,A,77%,8%,6%,8%,1%,"Explanation:
Scapholunate
Injury to the scapholunate ligaments results in SLAC and DISI (which is more common than VISI).
  Lunotriquetral
Injury to this ligament causes midcarpal dislocation (similar to lunate dislocation and also associate with triquetral fractures). Injury to this ligament also results in VISI.
  Dorsal Radiolunate
Lunate dislocation occurs secondary to a dorsal radiolunate injury.
  Capitolunate
Injury to this ligament is associated with perilunate dislocation.
 ",TRUE,"The scapholunate ligament is the most likely ligament to be injured in a case of dorsal intercalated segmental instability (DISI).

What is the most likely diagnosis?,"SBA: Genito urinary, Adrenal, Obstetrics & Gynaecology and Breast",Oncocytoma,RCC,TCC,Sarcoma,Metastasis,A,66%,28%,2%,2%,3%,"Explanation:
Despite the fact that RCCs are far more common than Oncocytomas the question writer has gone to the trouble of pointing out that the centre of the lesion is of low attenuation and in the context of an exam question this differentiates it from an RCC despite the overlap in appearances of both entities in real life.
  Oncocytoma
Oncocytomas have a characteristic feature of a stellate spoke wheel vascular pattern with a central scar which is low in attenuation and hyperechoic. In reality there is so much overlap between the features of these tumours, which are largely benign, and renal cell carcinomas, that oncocytomas must be resected for histological confirmation of the diagnosis. They can present at any age but are usually asymptomatic, despite often being very large. In the real world they can engulf the perinephric fat and confusingly come to resemble an AML which is unhelpful.
  Renal cell carcinoma (RCC)
This is the most common kidney tumour, accounting for around 80%. Patients are usually in their 50-70s although there is an increased incidence in dialysis patients and those with von Hippel Lindau. Clinically there is a classically macroscopic haematuria. A quarter or patients develop a paraneoplastic syndrome such as:
Hypercalcaemia
Polycythaemia due to erythropoietin
Stauffer syndrome (hepatomegaly without hepatic metastasis)
Limbic encephalitis
A renal protocol CT is used to evaluate lesions found on ultrasound and includes an unenhanced phase, a 60 second (corticomedullary) phase, and a 100 second (nephrogenic) phase. An excretory phase at 15 minutes can also be performed if evaluation of the collecting system anatomy is required (e.g. if the patient is a candidate for a partial nephrectomy). There are a number of different histological subtypes which are simplified and summarised in the table below:
  Histology
Prevalence
Associations
Clear cell renal carcinoma

Von Hippel Lindau syndrome
Papillary renal cell carcinoma
15%
Most strongly associated with dialysis patients. Better prognosis than clear cell (if diagnosed prior to metastasis).
Chromophobe renal cell carcinoma

Medullary carcinoma
<1%
Sickle Cell Trait
  Transitional cell carcinoma (TCC)
Bladder TCCs are very common but renal TCCs less so. Nonetheless they have a knack for appearing in multiple locations at once and thus careful evaluation of the upper tracts is necessary each time a new diagnosis of bladder TCC is made. They appear as filling defects on the excretory phase of a CT scan or IVU.
  Sarcoma
Renal sarcomas are rare and their imaging features relate well to their individual histology.
  Metastasis
Secondary neoplasms of the kidney are mainly adenocarcinoma in origin but are often mistaken for renal cell carcinomas since there can be little to distinguish them on imaging.",FALSE,"RCC (Renal Cell Carcinoma) is the most likely diagnosis because of the exophytic lesion that is enhancing less than the renal cortex with Hounsfield Units of 30 peripherally but only 5 centrally.

Please note that the question asks which is NOT a useful feature.
Anatomy plays a strong role in the correct diagnosis of male genitourinary tract cysts. It is first necessary to differentiate between intraprostatic cysts and extraprostatic cysts.
  Mullerian duct cyst (intraprostatic)
These are usually found in young adult men and are also caused by incomplete regression of the Mullerian duct. They have numerous similarities with prostatic utricle cysts, including an association with renal agenesis (although not with intersex disorders). Anatomically they are also posterior to the bladder however unlike prostatic utricle cysts they extend superiorly to the prostate and do not communicate with the urethra. On MRI they appear straightforwardly cystic unless complicated by infection. The shape of the cyst is said to be teardrop shaped rather than the pear-shaped prostatic utricle cysts.
    Mullerian duct cyst Prostatic utricle cyst
Age 20-40 years 0-20 years
Shape Teardrop Pear
Extends above prostate? Yes No
Communicates with prostatic urethra? No Yes
  Prostatic utricle cyst (intraprostatic)
These are found in teenagers or adolescents and represent incomplete regression of the Mullerian duct system during embryological development. They are found posterior to the bladder, within the prostate, and do not extend any more superiorly than the superior most aspect of the prostate. This anatomical detail and the fact that the cyst does communicate with the prostatic urethra sets it apart from a Mullerian duct cyst on imaging. They can cause all manner of lower urinary tract symptoms and boast an association with ipsilateral renal agenesis as well as intersex disorders. On MRI they are said to have a pear-shaped appearance.",FALSE,"4. The age of this patient is not useful in differentiating a Mullerian duct cyst from a utricle cyst.

44umol/l equates to 0.5mg/dL.
Contrast induced AKI is a contraversial topic. There is increasing evidence that it is an over-reported (possibly even completely non-existent!) phenomenon.
The current definitiion of CI-AKI is as follows:
Rise of serum creatinine by at least 0.3mg/dL within 48 hours of administration
Rise of serum creatinine of at least 50% over the baseline value within 48hrs of administration
Urine output below 0.5ml/kg/hr for 6 consecutive hours following administration.
(if no available baseline within the preceeding week is found, the lowest value within the last three months can be used. If no creatinine has been performed in the last three months then the creatinine should be repeated within 24hours, or a reference value can be estimated from the lowest creatinine measured subsequently)
Adequate hydration is the key to avoiding contrast-induced nephropathy where there is a risk of it occurring.
At risk groups are those with pre-existing renal impairment as well as diabetics, patients with sepsis, heart failure, or cirrhosis.

13741,206687,A 55-year-old woman with symptoms of breathlessness and palpitations is being investigated. Her chest x-ray shows bilateral symmetrical perihilar shadowing and pleural effusions. On examination she has a diastolic murmur and is thought to be in heart failure. She undergoes a Cardiac MRI scan which shows a pericardial mass. It is hyperintense to the myocardium on T1 and T2 and demonstrated enhancement on the post-contrast sequences. What is the most likely diagnosis?,SBA: Cardiothoracic and vascular,Malignant melanoma metastasis,Atrial myxoma,Atrial sarcoma,Colorectal cancer metastasis,Breast cancer metastasis,A,79%,8%,4%,1%,9%,"Explanation:
High T1 signal can be caused by:
Melanin, protein, contrast agents, fat, methaemaglobin (subacute haemorrhage).
Almost all malignant cardiac masses will show contrast enhancement.
  Cardiac metastases
Metastases are significantly more common than cardiac sarcomas, meaning metastases are the most common malignant cardiac tumours. In contrast to myxomas or fibroelastomas, malignant lesions tend to have a broad attachment to the heart wall. Tumours can be from lung or breast cancer, lymphoma, leukaemia and malignant melanoma.
Although malignant melanoma most commonly metastasizes to the lungs, liver, brain and skeleton and is rarely found in the heart, of cardiac metastases at all it is by far the most common.
  Atrial myxoma
These are the most common benign neoplasms of the heart. Although usually sporadic, they can occur as part of Carney syndrome (atrial myxoma, facial/buccal pigmentation, sertoli tumours of the testis and multiple other findings. Not to be confused with Carney triad - pulmonary chondromas, gastric leiomyosarcomas and extra-adrenal paragangliomas). The finding of a small mass attached to the interatrial septum by a stalk is classical. Their mobility allows some to prolapse through the relevant atrioventricular valve during the cardiac cycle. They can act as a focus for platelet aggregation leading to systemic emboli for the more common left sided masses or pulmonary emboli for right sided myxomas. Iso or hypointentisty on T1w MRI is typical.

  Cardiac sarcoma
There are many different types of cardiac sarcoma. Cardiac sarcomas are the most common cause of primary malignant cardiac tumours. Their presentation usually relates either to embolic phenomena such as TIAs or symptoms from invasion such as pericardial effusion. In contrast to myxomas or fibroelastomas, malignant lesions tend to have a broad attachment to the heart wall. Another useful differentiating feature on imaging is the involvement of more than one chamber of the heart.",FALSE,"Atrial myxoma is the most likely diagnosis based on the findings of the MRI scan.

The PSA is usually considered elevated when levels exceed 4ng/L. A number of things can artificially elevate the PSA and in many cases of an incidental elevated PSA once these have been excluded the PSA returns to normal. Patients should be counselled to avoid activities which could lead to an elevated PSA for at least 48hrs prior to the test.

  The PSA density is calculated by taking the PSA and dividing it by the volume of the prostate. The volume is calculated as: Height x Length x Depth x π/6 (the volume of an ellipsoid). It accounts for the increase in size of the prostate which occurs in many men with increasing age and allows a far more comparable indication of the likelihood of malignancy. 0.1 is considered a normal PSA density value. Prostate cancers are usually seen in those with a prostate density of >0.1ng/ml/cc.

Select ONE answer only.,SBA: Cardiothoracic and vascular,Amyloidosis,Sarcoidosis,Dilated cardiomyopathy,Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy,Infarction,A,84%,3%,9%,3%,2%,"Explanation:
The information available in the vignette is sparse. In a patient with a known history of multiple myeloma, amyloidosis should always be considered. Without further details of the nature/location of the enhancement, there is nothing to dissuade the candidate from this option.
  Amyloid cardiomyopathy
Amyloidosis is a cause of restrictive cardiomyopathy. On MRI scanning there is global enhancement of the endocardium, and on echocardiogram the myocardium takes on a characteristic granular and speckled appearance. In an exam question setting a history of multiple myeloma, rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's disease or similar may be given to suggest secondary amyloidosis.
        Image © Medical Exam Prep
    Sarcoidosis cardiomyopathy
Involvement of the myocardium is relatively rare in sarcoidosis. Inflammation causes myocardial scarring of the interventricular septum and left ventricle most commonly. This shows as epicardial or midwall delayed hyperenhancement on MRI. The patient in this question is certainly of an appropriate demographic for sarcoidosis. The main differential diagnoses would be myocarditis or Chagas disease based on imaging findings alone.
  Ischaemic cardiomyopathy
The blood supply to the heart muscle itself is of interest here. The endocardium derives its blood directly from the chambers whereas the layer referred to as the subendocardium receives blood from the terminal branches of the coronary vessels. By the time they reach the subendocardium these blood vessels are small enough that ventricular contraction causes a degree of compression. The end result is that the subendocardium is particularly vulnerable to ischaemia, a fact which manifests in the delayed hyperenhancement patterns seen on MRI; ischaemic cardiomyopathy is seen as subendocardial delayed hyperenhancement or in more extreme cases transmural hyperenhancement. The pattern of hyperenhancement is also territorial with ischaemic cardiomyopathy, depending on which vessel(s) has been affected.
  Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM)
HCM can be inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion; there are a number of specific different gene mutations which have been identified to cause cardiac myocardial hypertrophy. The most common category is asymmetrical hypertrophy, accounting for around two thirds of cases. Here the interventricular septum is markedly enlarged. The remaining third of cases display symmetrical/concentric hypertrophy or apical hypertrophy. Patients are younger than most of those with ischaemic cardiomyopathy. On MRI scanning midwall hyperenhancement at the junction between the right and left ventricles is typical.
  Alcoholic cardiomyopathy
Dilated cardiomyopathy occurs in patients with a history of alcohol abuse. There is dilation of both ventricles alongside thinning of the myocardium which appears hypokinetic on dynamic studies. Myocardial fibrosis occurs and because this typically affects the mid-myocardium it can be differentiated from ischaemic cardiomyopathy which is often transmural and confined to vascular territories. The different areas show delayed enhancement on MRI scans.",TRUE,"Amyloidosis is a condition in which abnormal proteins, called amyloid, build up in the body's organs and tissues.

Autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease can be divided into perinatal, neonatal, infantile and juvenile forms, depending on the age of disease presentation. The disease severity classically has an inverse correlation with the degree of hepatic fibrosis (the more mild the polycystic disease, the more severe the fibrotic disease.) It is also associated pancreatic fibrosis, Caroli disease and portal hypertension.
Subependymal giant cell astrocytoma is associated with tuberous sclerosis which has no relation to autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease.

What is the most likely diagnosis?",SBA: Musculoskeletal and Trauma,Osteoid osteoma,Osteoblastoma,Aneurysmal bone cyst,Pagets disease,Langerhans cell histiocytosis,A,94%,4%,1%,0%,1%,"Explanation:
The radiolucent nidus and symptoms of night pain in a young patient point to either an osteoid osteoma or an osteoblastoma. The final diagnosis comes down to size. <1.5cm is definitely an osteoid osteoma, and >2cm is definitely an osteoblastoma. There is a nasty grey area somewhere between the two sizes. The posterior elements of the spine are a classic location for osteoid osteomas.
Aneurysmal bone cysts – these are non-aggressive lesions demonstrating cystic ‘soap-bubble’ expansion. They can be primary lesions or secondary to GCTs, osteoblastomas, chondroblastomas and many others. On MRI fluid-fluid levels can be seen.
Paget disease – coarse trabeculae with cortical thickening are the radiographic features classically described in Paget disease. It is a disease of abnormal bony remodelling. Despite the impressive coarseness and thickening the bone is abnormal bone and therefore fragile, conferring a fracture risk under normal stressors It would be an unusual finding in a patient of this age.
Langerhans cell histiocytosis – There are a number of skeletal entities typically associated with LCH, in particular with the more benign version, eosinophilic granuloma. These include vertebra plana, and punched out lytic skull lesions.",TRUE,"Osteoid osteoma is a benign bone tumor that is most commonly found in the long bones of the arms and legs, and it is also known to occur in the spine.

The colon is the part of the large intestine that is situated between the caecum and the rectum. It receives digested food from the small intestine, from which it absorbs water and ions to form faeces. It is approximately 150 cm in length and is divided into four parts.
  1. Ascending colon:
This is the first part of the colon and is retroperitoneal. It ascends upwards from the caecum before turning right at a 90 degree angle at the right colic flexure (hepatic flexure) to become the transverse colon. It is approximately 20 cm long.
  2. Transverse colon:
This is the second part of the colon and is intraperitoneal. It extends transversely across the abdomen from the right colic flexure until it reaches the left colic flexure (splenic flexure) close to the spleen. Here it turns another 90 degrees inferiorly to become the descending colon. The transverse colon is the least fixed part of the colon. It is approximately 50 cm long.
  3. Descending colon:
This is the third part of the colon and is retroperitoneal in the majority of people. It extends inferiorly down the abdomen from the left colic flexure passing over the lateral border of the left kidney. At the point that it turns medially it becomes the sigmoid colon. It is approximately 30 cm long.
  4. Sigmoid colon:
This is the final part of the colon and is intraperitoneal. It extends downwards in an ‘S’ shape from the left iliac fossa to the level of the S3 vertebra. It is approximately 50 cm long.

What is the most likely diagnosis?,SBA: Paediatrics,Accessory palmaris,Hernia,Giant Cell Tumour,Rhabdomyosarcoma,Ganglion cyst,A,78%,2%,3%,12%,5%,"Explanation:
There are many different minor accessory muscle possibilities at the wrist/forearm. The mass described has a similar reflectivity to muscle.
  Muscular hernia
Muscular hernias are more often seen in the lower limbs than the upper limbs. They can be diagnosed with ultrasound when a lump of muscle can be seen protruding through a defect in the containing fascia. Clinically a patient with a lump which disappears when the underlying muscle is tensed should raise the suspicion of a muscular hernia.
  Ganglion cyst
These are fluid-filled masses associated with musculoskeletal structures. They are most recognisable in the wrist. Due to pressure effects on locally adjacent nerves they can be associated with numbness. On imaging they behave as would be expected for cystic masses however owing to a variable protein content of the gelatinous content they can return high signal on T1 weighted MRI sequences.
  Giant Cell Tumour also known as osteoclastoma
These are benign bony tumours arising from within bone. They can cause bony expansion from within but not bony scalloping from without. Since they always occur in the mature skeleton they are seldom found in children or adolescent patients although the peak age group is still young; 30s. Typically they occur around the knee but can be found anywhere in the skeleton. They are seen on x-ray as expansile lytic lesions with the words ‘soap bubble’ often used to describe them in literature. On MRI they usually return low signal on both T1 and T2, in contrast to many of the potential differential diagnoses which would otherwise return high signal on one or the other.
  Four criteria of GCT (according to Clyde A. Helms)
After epiphyseal closure
Abuts articular surface
Well defined, non-sclerotic margin
Eccentric location
  Rhabdomyosarcoma
These are often aggressive lesions which can be found anywhere in the body.

What is the absolute washout of this lesion?","SBA: Genito urinary, Adrenal, Obstetrics & Gynaecology and Breast",34%,23%,58%,66%,76%,A,80%,7%,4%,6%,3%,"Explanation:
Figures have been rounded to the nearest whole number.
Absolute washout = (65-50)/(65-21) = 34%
Relative washout = (65-50)/65 = 23%
    This lesion is non-adenomatous and the patient should be referred for PET/CT or resection depending on the clinical scenario. In many centres, if the lesion measures less than 10HU on the unenhanced sequence then the study will be terminated at that point.
  Adrenal washout
Washout characteristics of adrenal nodules help confirm or refute a diagnosis of an adrenal adenoma. The absolute washout takes into account the initial uptake of contrast whereas the relative washout calculation is based only on how well contrast washes out of a nodule.
The underpinning principle is that vasculature within malignant lesions is more permeable than in benign lesions. This allows contrast to diffuse out of the lesion during the portal venous phase and the contrast is then slower to wash out during the delayed phase than it would be for benign lesions. Thus the higher/faster washout characteristics (either absolute or relative) the more suggestive it is that a lesion is benign.
   ",TRUE,"The absolute washout of this lesion is calculated by subtracting the attenuation values of the delayed sequences from the attenuation values of the portal venous phase and then dividing by the attenuation value of the portal venous phase. In this case, the calculation is (65-50)/65 = 0.23 or 23%. Since washout is the opposite of this, the absolute washout of the lesion is (1-0.23) or 0.77 or 77%.

Three plane T2 imaging is common practice and enables full assessment of the peripheral zone of the prostate, particularly examining for extra-capsular extension, bladder base or seminal vesical invasion. T2 is also the most important sequence for lesions in the transitional zone.
Diffusion weighted imaging is essential for PIRADS calculation and is the first sequence that should be used to evaluate lesions in the peripheral zone. Axial dynamic contrast enhanced imaging (after non-contrast axial T1) is then essential to differentiate between between PIRADS 3 and 4 lesions.
The T1 weighted sequences are also useful to check for the presence of any haemorrhagic foci although since most patients now undergo their MRI scan prior to any biopsies being taken this has become far less important.
Interestingly the ADC map is more sensitive for carcinoma of the prostate (in the peripheral zone) than the DWI sequences.

9351,206687,A 35-year-old male patient complains to his GP about ongoing dysphagia. He has recently recovered from two separate lower respiratory tract infections and his GP is concerned about an oesophageal pathology. A barium swallow is arranged which demonstrates prominence of the crocopharyngeal muscle and a focal midoesophageal stricture with no associated shouldering. There is proximal dilatation and delayed clearance of barium. He undergoes a CT scan. There is a focal thickening of mid-oesophagus and some coarse calcification within it. What is the most likely aetiology of this stricture?,SBA: Gastrointestinal,Leiomyoma,Squamous cell carcinoma,Achalasia,Barrett oesophagus,Aberrant right subclavian artery,A,81%,7%,3%,6%,3%,"Explanation:
Oesophageal leiomyoma
Leiomyomas are said to be the only oesophageal lesions which can calcify. Generally, the absence of any shouldering of a stricture is a benign feature. Leiomyomas tend to arise in relatively young patients and are more common in the mid or distal thirds of the oesophagus. Ulceration is a very uncommon feature.
  Oesophageal carcinoma
Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the oesophagus predominantly affects the middle and lower thirds of the oesophagus. Adenocarcinoma arises in the lower third, mostly in areas of Barrett oesophagus, and accounts for most oesophageal cancers in the developed world. Both histological types are more commonly found in the lower part of the oesophagus than the upper part, but that being said, if a cancer is found in the upper third of the oesophagus, it is most likely to be squamous cell in origin. Some patients develop symptoms of dysphagia and retrosternal pain but sadly many tumours remain occult until they are at an advanced stage. This is in-part due to the fact that there is no serosal layer protecting the oesophagus and as such cancers can progress rapidly. Patients found to have Barrett oesophagus (metaplasia of the usual squamous epithelium to columnar epithelium) are screened frequently for adenocarcinoma. Importantly in the staging criteria, the only nodes which contribute to nodal staging are the immediately local ones to the cancer. Any involved lymph nodes of the cervical chains or coeliac region are considered as metastatic disease. It is therefore important to review these areas on a staging scan with particular attention.
  Achalasia
This is a motility disorder which causes a failure of relaxation of the gastro-oesophageal junction (GOJ) and disorganisation of oesophageal peristalsis. Ingested material (including barium during fluoroscopy) is held up at the GOJ in a column. On a barium study the column has a classical bird-beak tapering point at the inferior-most end where it reaches the GOJ. There is often then sudden emptying of the oesophagus due to eventual pressure on the GOJ exceeding its strength. Oesophageal contractions may be absent or may be non-peristaltic. On a CXR an air-fluid level may be seen behind the heart.
  Aberrant right subclavian artery
This common anomaly occurs when instead of being the first major branch of the aorta (technically the first branches are the coronary arteries), the right subclavian artery arises distal to the left subclavian artery. It then has to swerve back around to reach the right side and in doing so usually runs posterior to the oesophagus, which can be seen on a barium study as a smooth indentation. In some cases it can exert sufficient pressure on the oesophagus to cause dysphagia which is termed dysphagia lusoria.
An aberrant left pulmonary artery is the ‘only’ vascular anomaly to run between the oesophagus and the trachea. There are cases of aberrancy of the right pulmonary artery in the literature however these patients tend to die in infancy.
An anterior indentation of the oesophagus is caused by:
An aberrant left pulmonary artery
A posterior indentation of the oesophagus is caused by:
A right sided arch with an aberrant left subclavian artery
A left sided arch with an aberrant right sided subclavian artery
A double aortic arch – this is usually described as also causing an anterior indentation to the trachea",FALSE,"I chose this answer because Barrett oesophagus is a condition that is characterized by the presence of a focal mid-oesophageal stricture, proximal dilatation, and delayed clearance of barium.

What is the most likely diagnosis? Select ONE answer only.",SBA: Paediatrics,Idiopathic scrotal wall oedema syndrome,Testicular torsion,Epididymitis,Infected hydrocele,Scrotal trauma,A,87%,5%,4%,2%,3%,"Explanation:
Acute idiopathic scrotal wall oedema syndrome
This occurs mostly in children under the age of 10 but can occur in adults too and is an important differential diagnosis for acute scrotal pain. It is thought to be a kind of localised hypersensitivity reaction. Scrotal swelling is typical but accompanying pain may or may not be present. Features are usually fairly typical on ultrasound with unilateral scrotal wall oedema (can be bilateral in 10%) and hypervascularity. Reactive hydrocoeles may be present, as with most scrotal pathology. Importantly, the condition requires no surgical input and can be managed conservatively with NSAIDs, avoiding an unnecessary surgery/anaesthetic for the patient when correctly diagnosed.
  Testicular torsion
Acute testicular torsion is a surgical emergency and in the prepubertal age bracket torsion is more common than infection as a cause of testicular pain. Even 180o of torsion can result in reduced blood flow, however complete ischemia is usually only seen in cases of >720degrees of torsion. Time is of essence; as early as three hours there will be some irreversibility within the testicle. Ideally the diagnosis should be made clinically and the patient taken straight to theatre without need for an ultrasound diagnosis. When an ultrasound is performed, either in the emergent setting or in cases of a misdiagnosis of epidiymo-orchitis the testicle can appear normal in echotexture, especially within the first 6 hours, thus a normal scrotal ultrasound does not rule torsion out. Diffuse hypoechogenicity is seen beyond this and heterogeneity suggests necrosis. Scrotal skin oedema occurs and is usually readily visible on ultrasound. With the advent of colour Doppler further information can be gleaned. Reduced signal in the spermatic cord and reduced testicular flow are both signs of torsion. Since venous occlusion occurs prior to arterial occlusion, apparently normal blood flow on colour Doppler does not exclude torsion.
  Bell-clapper deformity
This is the most common cause of testicular torsion. When the tunica vaginalis inserts high onto the spermatic cord, the testis is left hanging in a lateral position and takes on an appearance mimicking the central part of a bell, known as the clapper. In this position the testicle is more vulnerable to twisting on its axis with compromise to the blood flow leading to ischaemia.
  Epididymo-orchitis
Infection of the epididymis with concomitant infection of the testis is called epididymo-orchitis; it is seen most commonly in young adolescents with Chlamydia and Gonorrhoea accounting for most cases in this age range. In older patients E-coli and proteus are more likely to be responsible. Ultrasound is useful only in excluding testicular torsion as a cause of the pain (although a normal scrotal ultrasound does not exclude torsion), and investigating the possibility of abscess formation in cases refractory to antibiotic therapy. On ultrasound a reactive hydrocoele is often present and epididymal enlargement occurs. Colour Doppler flow can be used to demonstrate hyperaemia within the testicle and epididymis as would be expected for an infective process.",TRUE,"I chose 4 because Idiopathic scrotal wall oedema syndrome is the most likely diagnosis based on the description of the ultrasound scan. The scan showed a hypervascular and thickened scrotal wall with normal vascularity in the left testis and epididymis, indicating that the swelling was due to an increase in the size of the scrotal wall, rather than a torsion of the testicle or an infection in the epididymis. Additionally, the presence of a small left sided hydrocoele suggests that the swelling was due to an accumulation of fluid in the scrotum, which is a common symptom of idiopathic scrotal wall oedema syndrome.",2,,A,FALSE,,C,TRUE,A
13753,206687,You are performing an ultrasound scan on a baby boy. There is splenomegaly and the splenic vein is tortuous. You notice tortuous vessels around the hepatic hilum. The hepatic and portal veins are patent but the hepatic artery shows a resistive index of 0.9. What is the most likely diagnosis?,SBA: Paediatrics,Budd-Chiari syndrome,Portal thrombosis,Lymphoma,Hepatitis E,Wilms tumour,A,48%,27%,9%,12%,4%,"Explanation:
Budd-Chiari syndrome is unusual in children and babies but can occur. It can be caused by haematological problems leading to thrombotic occlusion or as a result of a congenital membrane in the inferior vena cava distal to the liver, in which case the hepatic veins may appear patent.
  Budd-Chiari syndrome
The haemodynamics of the liver are different from any other organ, and can give rise to some interesting pathology. In Budd-Chiari syndrome venous obstruction causes flow reversal in the portal venous system to drain the liver. Acutely this presents as a triad of abdominal pain, ascites and hepatomegaly. In many acute cases the liver function tests have not had sufficient time to become deranged. The caudate lobe usually drains directly into the IVC so may not be affected by the underlying cause of obstruction to the other hepatic veins. Consequently it is able to shoulder more of the usual burden of the liver and becomes hypertrophied. In the acute setting this has not had time to manifest and the caudate lobe will be of a normal size.
  Some of the many causes of Budd-Chiari syndrome:
Thrombosis of the hepatic veins:
Platelets (thrombocytosis)
Pill (OCP)
Pregnancy (hypercoagulable state)
Polycythaemia rubra vera
Non-thrombotic causes:
Mechanical compression by a tumour
Right atrial myxoma
Constrictive pericarditis
  On CT the enhancement pattern is described as being ‘flip-flop’, with strong central and limited peripheral enhancement on early phases followed by early central washout with retained peripheral enhancement on delayed images. Alternatively the whole liver may appear mottled with a ‘nutmeg’ type pattern due to the venous congestion. On Doppler ultrasound or MRI the hepatic veins will show a reduction in calibre or not be seen at all and on Doppler insonation the hepatic veins may show little or no flow. Flow in the portal venous system, on the other hand, may be reversed. In chronic cases a veritable spiders-web of small collateral vessels can be seen on angiography; they can also be seen on MRI and are described as having a comma-shape.
   ",TRUE,"The presence of splenomegaly, a tortuous splenic vein, tortuous vessels around the hepatic hilum, and a resistive index of 0.9 in the hepatic artery are all suggestive of Budd-Chiari syndrome, a condition in which occlusion of the hepatic veins leads to congestion and enlargement of the liver and spleen.

Intussusception usually affects infants between the ages of 3 months and 3 years. The ileocolic type is the most common, followed by ileo-ileocolic.

9861,206687,A 34-year-old man suffers a knee injury while on a skiing holiday. He visits a local hospital and has x-rays taken of his knee. No fracture is found. Once back home he undergoes an MRI scan when the pain fails to resolve. The scan shows a tear of the medial collateral ligament and a sprain to the anterior cruciate ligament. High STIR signal is seen in the lateral femoral condyle and lateral tibial plateau too. What is the most likely diagnosis?,SBA: Musculoskeletal and Trauma,Clip injury,Transient patella dislocation,Pivot shift injury,Hyperextension injury,Dashboard injury,A,57%,2%,36%,4%,1%,"Explanation:
Bony contusions
Bruising to the bone can be detected around 2 days following an injury but may not resolve for many months thereafter. With regards knee injuries, it is often possible to discern the mechanism of injury from the pattern of bruising seen. The contusions follow fluid on MRI scans i.e. low in signal on T1 and high on T2 (and STIR). STIR is used to suppress the fat of the bone marrow thereby making the fluid stand out more.
  Clip injury and pivot shift injury
These two injuries are very similar. Both involve valgus stress on a flexed knee (such as a tackle to the knee during sports). A pivot shift injury also requires external rotation of the tibia. The three main structures most at risk during these injuries are:
Anterior cruciate ligament (especially in a pivot shift injury)
Medial collateral ligament (especially in a clip injury)
Medial meniscus (remember that the medial meniscus is attached to the medial collateral ligament)
If all three are present together it is referred to as the O’Donoghue triad. Since O’Donoghue defined this triad however, it has been discovered that lateral meniscal tears are actually more common with this type of injury than medial meniscus ones.
Bony contusions occur at the side of impact because the proximal tibia and distal femur impact on one another thus:
Lateral tibial plateau (posterolateral in pivot shift injury)
Lateral femoral condyle
  Transient lateral patella dislocation injury
When the patella dislocates laterally, its medial facet can impact onto the anterolateral corner of the lateral femoral condyle. Both areas become damaged and contusions can be seen on MRI. Often though, the patella reduces spontaneously and thus the exact mechanism of injury must be inferred from the imaging findings.
Joint effusion
Osteochondral injuries to the anterolateral femoral condyle and medial patella facet
Sprain or disruption to the medial retinaculum
  Hyperextension injury
These occur often following excessively forceful kicking. There will be bony contusions at the anterior aspect of the tibial plateau and femoral condyles. Either of the anterior or posterior cruciate ligaments may also be involved.
  Dashboard injury
As the name would suggest, this injury is usually stained by impact of the knee against the dashboard of a car during a road traffic incident. Force applied to the anterior aspect of the tibia when the knee is flexed leads to:
Osteochondral injury or fracture to the anterior aspect of the tibia
Posterior cruciate ligament rupture/sprain",FALSE,"The most likely diagnosis in this case is a hyperextension injury. This is because the MRI scan showed a tear of the medial collateral ligament and a sprain to the anterior cruciate ligament, as well as high STIR signal in the lateral femoral condyle and lateral tibial plateau.

  Lewy body dementia
A core clinical feature to this dementia is the fluctuant nature of the symptoms. Parkinsonian features can also develop although these are usually subsequent to the memory decline. Visual hallucinations are also a feature. Radiologically there is a generalised decrease in cerebral volume (sparing the hippocampi). Temporo-parietal hypoperfusion on HMPAO Tc99m SPECT scanning is indicative of Lewy body dementia. Involvement of the occipital cortex, which is typically spared in Alzheimer's disease, sets the two apart from one another on PET studies. The cingulate island sign has also been ascribed to Lewy body dementia, where there is preservation of metabolism in the mid-posterior cingulate gyrus. If present, this is said to be specific for Lewy body dementia.

    Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease
There are three types of this prion transmitted disease; the one linked to the BSE (bovine spongiform encephalopathy) epidemic of the late 1980s and 1990s, a rare familial variant, and finally a sporadic version which accounts for the vast majority of the cases. Clinically there is a rapidly progressive dementia with ataxia and myoclonus which should be the give-away feature even before imaging features are discussed. On MRI, the reported finding is of high T2/FLAIR signal in the basal ganglia bilaterally and symmetrically (particularly the putamen). The pulvinar sign is often described in association with cJD which describes high FLAIR signal in the pulvinar thalamic nuclei (called the hockey stick sign). Strangely the signal changes are a rare cause of restriction of diffusion, seen as bright areas on DWI. Important negatives for this condition are the lack of enhancement with contrast and the lack of white matter involvement (since the white matter is protected by its myelin sheath).
  Huntington disease
There are relatively few radiological manifestations of Huntington disease. The usual one described is atrophy of the heads of the caudate nuclei with consequential prominence of the adjacent lateral ventricle frontal horns with a ‘box’ like appearance. Various studies have been done to quantify the extent of this atrophy.
  Alzheimer's disease
The radiological findings of this well known disease are diffuse sulcal and ventricular enlargement. There is a disproportionate effect to the anterior temporal lobes, hippocampi and sylvian fissures with sparing of the sensorimotor and visual cortices, thalami and cerebellum.
  Parkinson's disease
Generalised cerebral atrophy occurs with Parkinson's disease but is a highly non-specific feature. There are, however, radiological findings in the midbrain which although subtle, are far more specific. Parkinson's disease occurs when there is neuronal loss in the substantia nigra, specifically the pars compacta of the substantia nigra. On a T2 weighted MRI image this appears as blurring of the intermediate signal intensity line which separates the two adjacent low intensity structures (these are the pars reticulata of the substantia nigra and the red nucleus).",FALSE,I chose this answer because the hockey stick sign on an MRI scan is a characteristic finding of Huntington disease.

9406,206687,A 52-year-old man presents to his GP with epigastric pain and weight loss. He has been taking a proton pump inhibitor for the last 6 months but says this is no longer helping. He is referred for a barium meal which shows multiple ulcers within the stomach and duodenum. The stomach is distended and the gastric folds are markedly thickened. What is the most likely diagnosis?,SBA: Gastrointestinal,Zollinger-Ellison syndrome,Lymphoma,Menetrier disease,Gastric carcinoma,Eosinophilic gastroenteritis,A,83%,2%,8%,3%,3%,"Explanation:
Zollinger-Ellison syndrome
Zollinger-Ellison syndrome is a consequence of excess gastrin circulation, usually from a gastrinoma within the pancreas. There is marked hypersecretion of gastric acid which predisposes the patient to ulcer formation since the normal gastric mucosal coating becomes overwhelmed. Patients may also experience diarrhoea but hypoproteinaemia is not a feature. On a barium study, as well as gastric ulcers, there may be rugal enlargement and dilution of barium by the large volume of acid. Ulcers may be present at unusual locations such as the duodenal bulb and around the ligament of Treitz.
  Menetrier disease
A triad of gastric glandular hypertrophy, achlorhydia and hypoproteinaemia makes up this condition. The rugal folds become enlarged and bizarre in configuration; often said to more closely resemble the convolutions of the cerebral cortex than the usual parallel orientation of normal gastric folds. Within the stomach there is hypersecretion of mucus and albumin (hence hypoalbuminaemia) and this prevents the barium from coating the mucosal surface effectively. The antrum is said to be spared although in reality it is involved in around half of cases but where it is spared it serves as an important discriminatory against gastric lymphoma which often does involve the antrum, as well as coming with associated splenomegaly. In contrast to scirrhous carcinoma the stomach’s ability to distend is retained.
  Gastric lymphoma
Within the context of lymphomas of the gastro-intestinal tract, gastric lymphoma is the most common site. The infiltrative form can give pronounced thickening of the gastric wall but the stomach’s ability to distend is usually preserved. On a barium study rugal thickening may be evident but the degree of gastric wall thickening is unlikely to be evident. There is no particularly predisposed part of the stomach but typically more than half of the stomach wall area is affected, including antral involvement in most cases. Hypersecretion and hypoalbuminaemia are not features of this condition but associated splenomegaly is likely.
  Gastric carcinoma
There is a subtype of gastric carcinoma called scirrhous carcinoma where instead of forming a solitary large mass the cancer infiltrates the entire gastric wall causing thickening and shrinkage of the stomach as well as compromising its ability to distend. The term scirrhous comes from the Greek word for hard and relates to the fibrous indistensible change to the stomach wall. The stomach becomes leathery and aperistaltic with appearances said to resemble an old leather drinking bottle; this appearance on a barium study is given the term linitis plastica.
  Eosinophilic gastroenteritis
This is a relapsing, remitting condition caused by eosinophilic infiltration of the wall of the stomach. The small bowel can also be affected and when it is, there may be accompanying hypoproteinaemia. Involvement of the stomach however, brings ‘only’ abdominal pain, diarrhoea and weight loss. Patients often have a concurrent history of allergies, either to food stuffs or other antigens. Within the stomach the condition is usually confined only to the antrum and there may be rugal enlargement, polyps and ulcers present.",TRUE,"Zollinger-Ellison syndrome (ZES) is a rare disorder characterized by the development of multiple peptic ulcers in the stomach and duodenum. It is caused by an overproduction of gastrin, a hormone that stimulates the production of stomach acid. The overproduction of gastrin leads to an increased acid production, which can cause the formation of ulcers in the stomach and duodenum. The barium meal in this case shows multiple ulcers in the stomach and duodenum, as well as a distended stomach and thickened gastric folds, which are all consistent with ZES. Therefore, Zollinger-Ellison syndrome is the most likely diagnosis.",2,,D,FALSE,,D,FALSE,D

The foramen ovale is located in the middle cranial fossa and is the largest of the three foramina of the middle cranial fossa. It is the only foramen in the middle cranial fossa that allows for direct communication between the middle and posterior cranial fossae.

Overall post-pneumonectomy changes are features of volume loss with fluid accumulation in the affected hemithorax.
As the now empty hemithorax gradually fills with fluid an air-fluid level is to be expected. This should reach approximately half-way up the chest on a CXR by day 4 or day 5 and should reach at least 66%, if not 100%, of the height of the chest on a CXR after a fortnight. Ipsilateral mediastinal shift also usually takes place owing to the volume loss although this is not an absolute finding; Some patients will have no mediastinal shift. Diaphragmatic elevation would be an expected finding, diaphragmatic flattening would not.
Post-operative complications of a pneumonectomy include:
5-10% bronchopulmonary fistula
Contralateral tracheal shift
Reduction in height of the fluid level on sequential films
5% ARDS
5% Pulmonary oedema

Which SINGLE ONE of the following is a feature of ochronosis?,SBA: Musculoskeletal and Trauma,Disc calcification,Rat bite erosions to the hands,Liver failure,Hook like osteophytes,Generalised increase in bone density,A,75%,4%,4%,9%,8%,"Explanation:
Alkaptonuria (also known as ochronosis)
This condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. It is caused by excessive circulating levels of homogentisic acid (HGA) when the enzyme which would usually degrade it is deficient. HGA has an affinity for collagen and accumulates in the connective tissues throughout the body. In visible light HGA has a blackish colour and thus the disease can be diagnosed in infancy when a baby’s nappies are stained black by the presence of HGA in the urine. By the time patients reach their 20s pigmentation may be visible in their skin, particularly the ears. This is initially a dark yellow colour (hence the term ochronosis, from ‘Ochre’ in Greek meaning a dark yellow colour) but can progress to blue-grey and black.
In imaging chondrocalcinosis is the most prominent feature, with calcification and destruction of the intervertebral discs. Premature osteoarthritic changes to the hands, feet, shoulders, hips and knees will also develop as the collagen deteriorates. Deposition in the heart and kidneys too leads to cardiac and renal failure.",FALSE,I chose 3. Hook like osteophytes because this is a common feature of ochronosis. Ochronosis is a rare inherited disorder caused by an enzyme deficiency which leads to the accumulation of a substance called homogentisic acid in the body.

Bilateral x-rays of the wrist are requested which show soft tissue swelling to the second and third digits with marginal erosions and periosteal new bone formation. What is the most likely diagnosis? Select ONE answer only.,SBA: Musculoskeletal and Trauma,Psoriatic arthropathy,Juvenile rheumatoid arthritis,Reiter syndrome,Infective arthropathy,Rheumatoid arthritis,A,98%,0%,1%,0%,1%,"Explanation:
Psoriatic arthropathy
Around a fifth of patients with psoriasis develop arthropathy and it is also possible to suffer from psoriatic arthropathy in the absence of the typical psoriatic cutaneous plaques.
Importantly, on x-ray there are findings of both erosive changes in addition to productive changes with periosteal new bone formation. The combination of the two contrives to leave a ‘pencil-in-cup’ appearance. The joints can appear fluffy due to the exuberance of new bone formation.
The differential diagnosis for periosteal reactions in the presence of an arthropathy is relatively narrow and very specific:
Psoriatic arthropathy
Juvenile rheumatoid arthritis
Reiter syndrome
Infective arthritis
  Although often classified as a distal arthropathy, preferring the DIPs to the MCPs, psoriatic arthropathy does also affect the spine and SI joints frequently. ‘Sausage digits’ is a term used to describe the diffuse soft tissue swelling which can affect the fingers and toes. Osteoporosis does occur but is a feature of later disease.",FALSE,"Rheumatoid arthritis is the most likely diagnosis because the symptoms (pain in both wrists) and findings (salmon-pink patch of skin on the forearm with silver colored scale, soft tissue swelling to the second and third digits, marginal erosions, and periosteal new bone formation) are all characteristic of this condition. Rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune disorder which causes inflammation of the joints and can lead to joint destruction and deformity.",2,,E,TRUE,,A,TRUE,A
12311,206687,A 49-year-old man with painless discharge and hearing loss undergoes a CT scan which shows a soft tissue mass in the middle ear. Erosion of which structure would be LEAST supportive of a diagnosis of cholesteatoma?,SBA: Central Nervous and Head & Neck,Cochlear aqueduct,Tegmen tympani,Incus,Scutum,Facial canal,A,61%,7%,3%,2%,28%,"Explanation:
Certainly the ossicles, lateral semicircular canal (Known by some as the Clint Eastwood sign) and lateral epitympanic wall (ie scutum) are often involved. Of the ossicles, the long process, lenticular process of the incus and the head of the stapes are commonly involved. The tegmen tympani is the roof of the middle ear and is also often involved. It can be seen superior to the ‘ice cream cone’ on coronal images. The tegmen mastoidium is the roof of the mastoid and is seen laterally to the tegmen tympani. The facial nerve canal is closely associated with the middle ear structures but the cochlear aqueduct runs medially from the cochlear and is therefore less likely to be affected by a cholesteatoma.
There are two types of acquired cholesteatoma:
                Pars flaccid – classically erodes the scutum
                Pars tensa – classically erodes the ossicles",FALSE,"I chose this answer because a cholesteatoma is a type of skin growth that often grows behind the eardrum and can cause erosion of the surrounding structures. The scutum is a thin bone located in the middle ear that separates the tympanic cavity from the mastoid antrum, and it is not typically affected by cholesteatomas.",2,"This question falls under the category of clinical judgement, what is the correct diagnosis?",C,TRUE,,A,FALSE,D

Select ONE answer only.",SBA: Central Nervous and Head & Neck,Subarachnoid haematoma,Combined haematomas,Epidural haematoma,Subdural haematoma,Intercerebral parafalcine haematoma,A,33%,5%,7%,53%,2%,"Explanation:
Blood being present within the fissures suggests subarachnoid origin.
  The learning point here is how a haemorrhage deals with the sutures. Extradural (aka epidural) haematomas do cross the midline but do not cross suture lines as this is where the dura is attached to the skull. Subdural haematomas on the other hand do not cross the midline but do extend along the falx, dipping down and affecting both sides of the falx cerebri on the coronal views for example. Combined haematomas (ie extradural and subdural) are possible but on balance the question seems to imply that it is one haematoma rather than two with separate properties for each.
A subarachnoid haemorrhage can be seen as high density on CT within the small fissures on the surface of the brain, as well as into the larger fissures such as the interhemispheric fissure. Obviously very small subarachnoid haemorrhages can be very hard to spot on CT scans and a high index of suspicion is required.

What is the most likely diagnosis?",SBA: Musculoskeletal and Trauma,Osteopoikilosis,Metastases,Bone islands,Multiple myeloma,Stress fracture,A,50%,35%,9%,2%,4%,"Explanation:
  Osteopoikilosis
This benign condition leads to multiple small oval bone islands forming around the skeleton. It usually looks absolutely characteristic and review of old films would confirm the diagnosis, however it has been (deliberately) poorly described in the question.  Frustrating though this may be, it is reflective of the nature of some of the questions in the exam.
Purportedly, once the epiphyses have fused the number remains static. They can (albeit rarely, such that many sources say ‘never’ happens) show mildly increased uptake on a nuclear medicine bone scan. Whereas a bone island may exist in isolation or near isolation, the finding of multiple such lesions suggests the diagnosis of osteopoikilosis.
  Since osteopoikilosis is a condition consisting of multiple bone islands, the answer option of 'bone islands' is also technically correct. Given the choice (arguably unfair though it may be) between these two options, osteopoikilosis is a more specific entity and deemed to be correct in this case.
 ",FALSE,"Metastases is the most likely diagnosis because it is the most common cause of sclerotic foci in the pelvic girdle and femora, and because the patient has a history of cancer.

Select ONE answer only.",SBA: Paediatrics,Infradiaphragmatic TAPVR,TOF,TGA,PDA,Pulmonary atresia with a VSD,A,29%,26%,21%,11%,13%,"Explanation:
Total anomalous pulmonary venous return (TAPVR)
Anomalous pulmonary venous return can be partial or total. In the latter, the oxygenated blood returning from the lungs fails to drain into the left side of the heart but reaches the right side of the heart by other avenues. Such babies are dependent on a right-to-left shunt (usually an ASD). TAPVR is not a duct-dependant condition (which usually present around day 4-5 when the duct closes) but can also present in the very early neonatal period with unstable cyanosis.
Most patients with this condition return the oxygenated blood from the lungs to the right side of the heart via either the brachiocephalic veins or the coronary sinus. Excessive pressures on the lungs cause pulmonary plethora and, if not picked up antenatally or neonatally, can compensate for the initial few weeks and months. Owing to the prominence of the supracardiac vasculature, the appearance on a chest radiograph is said to resemble a snowman.
In the case of infradiaphragmatic TAPVR, the venous return from the lungs is via the portal vein or IVC. As the anomalous pulmonary vein passes through the diaphragm (at the oesophageal hiatus) it becomes compressed, leading to an acute presentation in the early neonatal period with pulmonary oedema. The heart size is usually normal and the patient may not have developed plethora by the time of presentation. Of importance to note, some patients with infradiaphragmatic TAPVR may benefit from prostaglandin therapy helping to maintain the ductus venosus in the abdomen. Depending on the exact anatomy of the anomalous venous drainage, the ductus venosus may be critical for circulation in a small number of these patients.

   ",FALSE,"Pulmonary atresia with a VSD is the most likely diagnosis because the radiograph shows bilateral air-space opacities and a normal heart size.

13912,206687,A 70-year-old man undergoes an MRI scan of the base of his skull. He has previously undergone surgery for a left sided cholesteatoma and the surgeon is concerned there may be a recurrence. Within the surgical cavity on the left there is a mass which does not enhance on the post-contrast sequences. On the DWI sequences there is no restriction of diffusion. What is the most likely diagnosis? Select ONE answer only.,SBA: Central Nervous and Head & Neck,Otitis media,Recurrent cholesteatoma,Aberrant internal carotid artery,Granulation tissue,Glomus tumour,A,37%,12%,2%,38%,11%,"Explanation:
Otitis media causes fluid signal to be seen within the middle ear or middle ear cavity following a cholesteatoma resection.
Cholesteatomas are difficult to manage as they have a high recurrence rate. Imaging has a significant role to play in the management of recurrent cholesteatomas; distinguishing recurrence from post-operative granulation tissue or fluid is important.
  Diagnosis Restricts Diffusion Enhances
Recurrent cholesteatoma Yes No
Granulation tissue No Yes
Fluid No No
  Post-contrast sequences for recurrent cholesteatomas require a delay of around 45 minutes from giving the contrast to acquiring images as the granulation tissue is slow to take up contrast. This has obvious down-sides to any modern day busy MRI schedule. However since the management of post-operative granulation tissue and post-operative fluid is largely identical, namely expectant, it is not important to differentiate the one from the other. Thus findings on diffusion weighted sequences are the most important thing in post-operative cholesteatoma imaging.
  Cholesteatoma
Cholesteatomas (Acquired or congenital) are histolologically epidermoid cysts. On imaging the finding of non-dependant soft tissue and bony erosion within the middle ear is typical for a cholesteatoma.
There are two types of acquired cholesteatoma:
Pars flaccida (80%) – classically erodes the scutum and extends superiorly
Pars tensa (20%) – classically erodes the ossicles, extending medially
  These refer to the two parts of the tympanic membrane from which they arise.
  Image © Medical Exam Prep
  In due course, if left unattended, a cholesteatoma will expand to fill the entire middle ear. Prior to this point they can be seen as non-dependant soft tissue within the middle ear. Dependant soft tissue within the middle ear suggests the presence of fluid or pus and the diagnosis of a middle ear infection. Once a cholesteatoma has filled the middle ear completely however no gas remains from which to discern dependency.
There are a number of theories as to how cholesteatomas arise. One theory is that following a perforation of the tympanic membrane entry of desquamated stratified keratinised squamous epithelium from the external auditory canal into the middle ear is permitted. There it adheres to the tympanic membrane and proliferates unrelentingly causing a soft tissue mass to form and eventually leading to bony erosion of the ossicles, scutum and/or other parts of the middle ear.
A congenital cholesteatoma behaves in a similar manner but is present from birth due to an aberrant location of a tiny island of keratinised squamous epithelium.
  Cholesterol granuloma
A cholesterol granuloma occurs as a sequela of recurrent bouts of otitis media. Haemorrhage within the middle ear leads to the formation of granulation tissue. On imaging this is seen as non-specification of the middle ear on CT. Bony changes can occur chronically with bony expansion, or displacement and even destruction of the ossicles. The signals characteristics on MRI are therefore important to distinguish it from a cholesteatoma. Whereas a cholesteatoma on MRI is isointense to brain parenchyma on T1, a cholesterol granuloma will show high signal in the middle ear on T1 due to the paramagnetic effects of methaemoglobin. On clinical examination the ENT surgeon may report a bulging blue tympanic membrane. This is classical. Dehiscence of the jugular bulb is an important differential diagnosis to exclude as this will also give a blue tympanic membrane on examination but the management is radically different!
  Aberrant internal carotid artery
An aberrant internal carotid artery can cause a pulsatile mass in the middle ear. The question usually asked on this topic is slightly different and to do with the persistent stapedial artery and consequential aplastic foramen spinosum (anatomically – ‘the heel of the high-heeled shoe’). The stapedial artery in such cases arises from the internal carotid artery and runs through the stapes, becoming the middle meningeal artery (which usually arises from the external carotid artery and courses through the foramen spinosum).",FALSE,"The most likely diagnosis based on the given information is recurrent cholesteatoma. This is because the mass does not enhance on post-contrast sequences and there is no restriction of diffusion on DWI sequences. These two characteristics are consistent with recurrent cholesteatoma, which is a benign growth that can occur in the middle ear cavity after surgery. Other diagnoses, such as otitis media, aberrant internal carotid artery, granulation tissue, and glomus tumour, do not typically present with these characteristics.",2,,B,FALSE,,D,FALSE,C
11516,206687,A 20-year-old man who has been experiencing symptoms of tiredness and malaise for the last 6 months presents to his GP. His GP requests some basic blood tests and among other abnormalities these show that his kidney function is very poor. On examination there are enlarged axillary lymph nodes and hepatosplenomegaly is evident. He undergoes an ultrasound scan which also shows both his kidneys to be enlarged and echogenic. Which of the following best explains the appearances of the kidneys?,"SBA: Genito urinary, Adrenal, Obstetrics & Gynaecology and Breast",Amyloidosis,Leukaemia,Castleman disease,HIV,Lymphoma,A,17%,7%,8%,14%,54%,"Explanation:
The vignette suggests that the patient has lymphoma however the ultrasound appearances of renal lymphoma do not fit with those provided. Of the other options provided, both HIV (where patients are at greater risk of developing lymphoma) and amyloidosis (occuring secondary to lymphoma) could give the ultrasound appearances described however HIV nephropathy although associated renal parenchymal hyperechogenicity, is unlikely to be the presenting feature of the HIV infection.
  Renal amyloidosis
Amyloidosis can be either primary or secondary and Hodgkin lymphoma can be a cause of secondary amyloidosis. Renal amyloidosis usually presents as nephrotic syndrome (proteinuria, hypoalbuminaemia, hyperlipidaemia). Imaging features can be relatively classical, causing bilateral renal enlargement and increased echogenicity. The combination of these two features should make you think of amyloidosis. Most renal pathology causes reduced echogenicity so amyloidosis stands almost alone in this respect. Nephrocalcinosis is the obvious other textbook cause of increased echogenicity and the differential diagnosis is longer in the paediatric age range. 
  HIV
Patients with HIV are more at risk of developing lymphoma so the scenario would also fit in that respect. HIV nephropathy tends to arise in patients with a low CD4 cell count and is not a usual de novo presentation of the virus. HIV nephropathy cannot be diagnosed by ultrasound alone, and a renal biopsy should be performed for confirmation however the kidneys of a patient affected by HIV nephropathy can be enlarged and the renal parenchyma can become more echogenic than usual. The sinus fat, however, becomes oedematous and therefore hypoechoic.
  Renal lymphoma
Renal lymphoma may be seen as an incidental finding or in the context of a pre-existing non-Hodgkin lymphoma study. Involvement of the kidneys can be either via haematogenous spread or direct extension from retroperitoneal lymph nodes. The appearances on CT tend to fall into one of a few different categories despite there being little difference in the type of lymphoma.
By far the most common pattern is that of multiple bilateral masses. The masses tend to enhance poorly with contrast and are therefore seen as low attenuation against the normal renal parenchyma.A large solitary mass mimicking a renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is another type of renal lymphoma presentation. These will usually be more homogenous in appearance than an RCC although there is much overlap in appearances of the two.
Contiguous retroperitoneal extension can appear quite drastic on a CT scan. Often associated with bulky lymph nodes in the retroperitoneum there is a homogeneous soft-tissue mass encasing the renal vessels which can usually still be seen running through the mass even when it is significantly large.
Perirenal disease is odd in so far as it can leave the renal parenchyma itself relatively unharmed. It appears as low attenuation surrounding the kidney at may at first casual glance, be mistaken for a urinoma.
Infiltrative disease can be a subtle finding when there is bilateral renal enlargement. The key finding is that although enlarged, the kidneys retain their ‘reniform’ shape. Infiltrative lymphoma is the most likely of the above to cause a decline in renal function. Usually kidneys infiltrated with lymphoma would appear hypoechoic, not echogenic.

  Castleman disease
This disease causes significant lymph node enlargement either in one compartment or, often when associated with HIV infection, in multiple different locations at once. The typical age range tends to be 30s-40s for unicentric disease or 40s-50s for multicentric disease. Most often it is discussed as a cause of isolated mediastinal lymph node enlargement but it can also affect the abdomen. When multicentric, hepatosplenomegaly is often a feature. On CT an enhancing rim to the lymph nodes is seen, indicative of the vascular capsule surrounding the nodes. Renal involvement is rare.",FALSE,"I chose lymphoma because lymphoma is a type of cancer that can cause enlarged lymph nodes and hepatosplenomegaly, as well as enlarged and echogenic kidneys on ultrasound scans.

This is a straightforward anatomy question. In the cervical spine the nerve roots exit above their named vertebral body; thus at the level of C4/5 it is the C5 which will be exiting. This is unlike the lumbar spine where the nerve root exits below its named vertebral body and is explained by the presence of 8 cervical nerve roots with only 7 cervical vertebra.
There is also the concept of the exiting nerve root and the descending nerve root. This applies in particular to disc bulges/protrusions/extrusions and is more pertinent in the lumbar spine. The exiting nerve root at a given level will be one less than the descending nerve root. (ie at L2/3 the exiting nerve will be L2 and the descending nerve will be L3).

11961,206687,A 14-year-old boy presents with a long history of temporal lobe epilepsy. An MRI scan of the brain reveals atrophy as well as high signal of the left hippocampus on T2-weighted and FLAIR images. The boy’s parents report that he used to suffer from prolonged febrile convulsions in childhood. What is the most likely diagnosis?,SBA: Paediatrics,Mesial temporal sclerosis,Hashimoto encephalopathy,Hippocampal glioma,Immune mediated limbic encephalitis,Previous herpes simplex encephalitis,A,88%,1%,1%,4%,7%,"Explanation:
Mesial temporal sclerosis
This is a specific pattern of hippocampal neuronal loss with associated gliosis and atrophy. On MRI there is high T2 signal which is best seen on coronal sequences. Refractory epilepsy is a classical history.
  Limbic encephalitis
The limbic system comprises the olfactory tract, temporal lobes, cingulated gyrus and insular cortex. Limbic encephalitis has either a paraneoplastic aetiology or an autoimmune one. Involvement of the mesial temporal lobes is classical. In the case of a paraneoplastic syndrome the classical cause is a lung tumor, specifically bronchial small cell lung cancer. Of the other options provided breast cancer has also been found to be associated with limbic encephalitis but is far less classical. Other possible options would have been thymic and testicular cancers. Psychotic features are prevalent and serve well to distinguish limbic encephalitis from HSV encephalitis although there is often overlap in the literature. Limbic encephalitis will show no haemorrhage which can also differentiate it from HSV encephalitis.
  Herpes simplex encephalitis
HSV encephalitis in immunocompetent individuals usually gives a classical appearance of high T2 signal particularly affecting the temporal and frontal lobes but also with a predilection for the rest of the limbic system too. It would however have a more acute history than that provided. Presentation as seizures would not be unusual though. Cytotoxic oedema can cause a degree of mass effect and also restriction of diffusion on DWI. There is a classical feature to separate it from Japanese encephalitis which is sparing of the basal ganglia.
One of the main differential diagnoses for HSV encephalitis would be a low grade glioma.
  Low grade glioma (of the hippocampus)
Low grade tumours can be readily missed on imaging, particularly non-related imaging (ie as an incidental finding on an MRI IAMs). There is often little or no mass effect and may be no appreciable contrast enhancement. T2 hyperintensity is a factor of peri-lesional oedema which may also be absent. The border between these tumours and normal cerebral tissue can be radiologically invisible. An association with localised cerebral atrophy is not a feature though, making it an unlikely choice for this question.
  Hashimoto encephalopathy
This is a very rare condition relating to hashimoto thyroiditis. MRI studies of the patients whose case reports are described in the literature have shown high T2 signal to the frontal and temporal lobes but there is little else here to commend this as a viable answer.",TRUE,"Mesial temporal sclerosis is the most likely diagnosis in this case, as it is a common cause of temporal lobe epilepsy and is associated with a history of prolonged febrile convulsions.

Which of the following findings regarding subclavian steal syndrome is INCORRECT? Select ONE answer only.,SBA: Central Nervous and Head & Neck,There is a filling defect in the subclavian vein,The most common cause is atherosclerosis,It can present as syncope,It can be caused by Takayasu aortitis,There is flow reversal in a vertebral artery unilaterally,A,86%,5%,1%,5%,3%,"Explanation:
Subclavian steal syndrome occurs when blood supplying the arm (usually the left arm) travels via the ipsilateral vertebral artery in order to bypass a proximal obstruction of the subclavian artery. The distal subclavian artery ‘steals’ blood from the vertebral artery circulation. This gives rise to two different categories of symptoms:
Arm - weaker pulses, numbness, paraesthesia, fingertip necrosis
Brain - syncope, ischaemic symptoms
The most likely cause of subclavian steal would be atherosclerosis. Takayasu aortitis and aortic dissections can also cause subclavian steal but would not be at the top of a differential list without further prompts from the history.",FALSE,"Subclavian steal syndrome presents with symptoms of cerebral hypoperfusion, such as dizziness, lightheadedness, and syncope. It is caused by a narrowing or occlusion of the subclavian artery, which leads to a decrease in blood flow to the subclavian vein, resulting in a reversal of flow in the vertebral artery. The most common cause is atherosclerosis, but it can also be caused by Takayasu aortitis. There may be a filling defect in the subclavian vein, which can be seen on Doppler ultrasound.",1,"3.

For the most part it will be the vascular surgeons or interventional radiologists themselves who decide on a case-by-case basis whether they themselves are prepared to attempt endovascular repair of a given aneurysm. Broadly speaking however, there are a number of criteria which the surgeon or interventionalist would be wise to abide by:
Distance to the renal arteries – 10mm used to be the absolute minimum landing zone distance required but many of the grafts would required a minimum of 15mm. If the landing zone is less than 10mm a fenestrated graft must be used to preserve the patency of the renal arteries.
Angle of the neck – this is measured one of two ways in the literature. Consequently there are two different values for an acceptable angle. A purely straight aneurysm would have a neck angle of either 180o or 0o in each of the different measuring systems. Thus the acceptable neck cut-off values are 120o or 60o in each case.
Angle of the common iliac artery – fortunately this is easier to remember. Iliac arteries at 90o or worse are significantly harder to stent. Further consideration is usually given to the overall tortuosity of the iliac arteries but this relates to endovascular access as opposed to stent deployment.
Common iliac artery (CIA) length – Ideally the CIA should be longer than 20mm to accommodate the stents used. Shorter lengths may require landing in the external iliac artery with deliberate occlusion of the internal iliac artery and reliance on pelvic collaterals.
Common iliac artery diameter – Stents are difficult to place where the diameter of the CIA is less than 7mm. ",FALSE,"Answer: 1. 20mm infrarenal neck. The infrarenal neck is the portion of the aorta between the renal arteries and the aneurysm, and an infrarenal neck of 20mm or less is generally considered too wide for endovascular repair.",1,"This question falls under category 1: Basic factual recall, either of basic science, physics, anatomy or regarding a procedure.",A,FALSE,,D,FALSE,D

Select ONE answer only.,SBA: Gastrointestinal,IgG4 levels,Biopsy,EUS,MRCP,Ca19-9 levels,A,80%,1%,2%,13%,3%,"Explanation:
IgG4 related diseases are one of Radiology’s newest entities. They comprise a constellation of fibrotic conditions affecting virtually every part of the body, mediated by a subclass of Immunoglobulin called IgG4. Where one condition exists others may also be present. The more common of these include:
Autoimmune pancreatitis (most common manifestation)
Orbital pseudotumour
Fibrosing mediastinitis
Riedel thyroiditis
Sclerosing mesenteritis
Retroperitoneal fibrosis
  Specific to sclerosing mesenteritis is the ‘fat-halo’ sign (fat-ring sign) where there is misty mesenteric soft tissue density fat stranding but the fat immediately adjacent to the mesenteric vessels is spared.
Serum IgG4 levels are usually (but not always) elevated in patients with IgG4 related disease, and this should be the first test performed. Patients can respond extremely well to corticosteroid therapy.
  Autoimmune pancreatitis
The main role of imaging is to exclude malignant pathology. The typical appearance is of a diffusely enlarged 'sausage-shaped' pancreas. Enhancement may be slightly delayed owing to the degree of fibrotic change and on duct-imaging (ERCP, MRCP), benign strictures of the pancreatic ducts may be appreciated. The duct-penetrating sign is used to differentiate these from malignant strictures; if the duct traverses an area of concern then malignancy is unlikely. In a malignant stricture the duct will be occluded. The pancreatic duct is usually narrowed although some mild upstream dilatation may be present as a result of stricturing. Biopsy and pathological confirmation of the diagnosis can be helpful if deemed necessary but the combination of typical CT findings, elevated serum IgG4 levels and response to corticosteroids is often sufficient. Ca19-9 levels may also be elevated and so do not help differentiated the condition from the presence of a neoplastic lesion.",FALSE,I chose 3. EUS because it is the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient.

    An ameloblastoma (aka adamantinoma) is classically described as having a soap-bubble appearance with cortical destruction. Ameloblastomas also erode the overlying teeth, a feature which is almost unique to lucent jaw lesions. They are more usually multilocular and show fluid-fluid levels on MRI. Although painless, they are locally aggressive.
  An odontogenic keratocyst is a unilocular lucent lesion which demonstrates a smooth border. They can be indistinguishable from dentigerous cysts given that they are often associated with an unerupted tooth. They also have an association with Gorlin syndrome (BCCs).
  A dentigerous cyst (aka follicular cyst) develops around the crown of an unerupted tooth. They are typically painless however.

What is the most likely diagnosis?,"SBA: Genito urinary, Adrenal, Obstetrics & Gynaecology and Breast",Epididymo-orchitis,Acute testicular torsion,Missed testicular torsion,Chronic testicular torsion,Reversed torsion,A,97%,1%,1%,0%,0%,"Explanation:
Epididymo-orchitis
Infection of the epididymis with concomitant infection of the testis is called epididymo-orchitis; it is seen most commonly in young adolescents with Chlamydia and Gonorrhoea accounting for most cases in this age range. In older patients E-coli and proteus are more likely to be responsible. Ultrasound is useful only in excluding testicular torsion as a cause of the pain (although a normal scrotal ultrasound does not exclude torsion), and investigating the possibility of abscess formation in cases refractory to antibiotic therapy. On ultrasound a reactive hydrocoele is often present and epididymal enlargement occurs. Colour Doppler flow can be used to demonstrate hyperaemia within the testicle and epididymis as would be expected for an infective process. Historically nuclear medicine scanning was used to confirm the diagnosis with findings of increased activity in the epididymis being expected owing to the hyperaemia.
  Testicular torsion
Testicular torsion is a surgical emergency with salvage rates dropping sharply beyond the first six hours. A normal ultrasound scan does not exclude testicular torsion, particularly if performed within the first six hours. Acute unilateral pain beginning at night is a typical history and the peak age range is in either newborn boys or young adolescents (13-16 years). Ultrasound features, if present, are as follows:
Hypoechoic compared to the normal side (after 6 hours)
Heterogenous if there is ischaemic necrosis present (after 24 hours)
Enlarged (after 8 hours)
Absent Doppler signal (incomplete torsion can show flow)
Twisting of the spermatic cord with spiralling vessels
  Missed torsion
Where ultrasound features of heterogeneous testis with increased peri testicular flow but absent testicular flow are found in a patient with symptoms lasting longer than 24 hours, a missed torsion can be diagnosed.
  Chronic torsion
Beyond around 10 days the testicle becomes small and homogeneously hypoechoic with an enlarged and echogenic epididymis.
  Reversed torsion also known as torsion-detorsion sequence
Increased blood flow within the testicle is either caused by infection or reversed torsion (a testicular tumour can also show increased blood flow).",TRUE,"Epididymo-orchitis is the most likely diagnosis based on the patient's symptoms and the ultrasound findings. Testicular torsion is a medical emergency that requires immediate surgical intervention to prevent permanent damage to the testicle. Symptoms of testicular torsion include severe pain, swelling, and discoloration of the scrotum. However, in this case, the patient has had the symptoms for three days and the ultrasound findings indicate enlargement of both the epididymis and testis, which is more consistent with epididymo-orchitis.",2,,B,TRUE,,A,FALSE,C
14143,206687,"A 31-year-old lady who is 25 weeks pregnant with her first pregnancy presents with an aching leg, shortness of breath and tachycardia. Full blood count and renal function tests are normal. A chest x-ray is also normal. The admitting team suspect she may have a pulmonary embolism. Which of the following is the best test to perform next? Select ONE answer only.","SBA: Genito urinary, Adrenal, Obstetrics & Gynaecology and Breast",Ultrasound doppler of the legs,Ventilation only scan,Perfusion only scan,Ventilation/ perfusion scan,CT pulmonary angiogram,A,76%,1%,10%,7%,5%,"Explanation:
A pregnant patient suspected to have a pulmonary embolus should undergo a chest x-ray to look for alternative causes of shortness of breath such as a lower respiratory tract infection, pleural effusions or a pneumothorax. In the event that they go on to have a VQ scan a chest radiograph is required for comparison.
Thereafter the patient should undergo bilateral lower limb venous dopplers if they have signs or symptoms of deep vein thrombosis. Around a third of pregnant patients who develop pulmonary emboli will have a deep vein thrombosis and for these patients treatment can be started on the basis of their DVT diagnosis without the need for further imaging. If the patient has no signs or symptoms of a DVT, they should proceed to a VQ scan or a CTPA.
The patient should be counselled that there is a small increase in the absolute risk of the foetus developing a childhood cancer following a maternal VQ scan but also that the absolute risk of maternal breast cancer is reduced compared to a CTPA.
  CTPA
CTPA imaging confers a lower dose to the foetus than V/Q scanning, although this effect is diminished in the third trimester as the gravid uterus becomes closer to the field of view.
Unfortunately however, CTPA confers a far greater dose to the breast tissue of the mothers at a time when the tissue is more radiosensitive than it would otherwise be in a non-pregnant woman.
A secondary consideration is the use of iodinated contrast. Iodine crosses the placenta and is excreted by the foetal kidneys into the amniotic fluid. Babies of mothers who have received iodinated contrast during pregnancy should be tested during their first week of life for thyroid suppression although there is little evidence in literature to suggest that many if any infants have developed hypothyroidism following maternal intravenous iodine exposure.
Technical factors to performing a CTPA scan in pregnant patients, if required, are also important to consider. Hyperdynamic circulation can render usual triggering bolus mechanisms suboptimal and raise the possibility of a non-diagnostic study.
  V/Q or Q only scanning
V/Q scanning confers a far lower breast dose to the mother but the dose to the foetus, particularly when small, can be greater owing to tracer accumulation within the solid organs of the mother. The mother should be encouraged to adequately hydrate and void frequently in the subsequent hours/days following a scan.
Many institutes choose to perform perfusion scanning only in pregnant women on the understanding that if the perfusion scan is normal then there is no need to go on to perform the ventilation study. The perfusion scan can also be performed at half the usual dose to further reduce the foetal-dose. Naturally doing so comes with the trade-off of lower sensitivity and specificity.
  Gadolinium in pregnancy
Gadolinium also crosses the placenta and is excreted by the foetus into the amniotic fluid. The chelated form of gadolinium in itself poses no risk to the foetus however the free form of gadolinium is teratogenic and the longer the foetus is exposed to the chelated gadolinium administered for the scan, the greater the risk of each molecule of gadolinium becoming dissociated from its chelate. For this reason therefore, gadolinium should only be administered in a patient known to be pregnant, if there is likely to be significant diagnostic benefit from the resultant images.
  Considerations during lactation
Less than 1% of injected iodine or gadolinium is excreted into breast milk and less than 1% of this is then absorbed by the baby's intestinal tract. Although these amounts are considered acceptably low as to not necessitate any breast-feeding cessation advice many families are understandably over-cautious. It is accepted that contrast agents are undetectable in blood 24hours after administration and so any mother wishing to 'pump-and-dump' despite the negligible risks need not do so for longer than a day. Care should, however, be given to counsel the family that it is possible for inadvertent weaning to occur even after short intervals and this should be factored in to any decision made by the family.
Following a nuclear medicine study the risks to the baby are two-fold; firstly from tracer excretion into the breast milk, but also through proximity to the mother during breast-feeding. Recommendations for breast-feeding interruption vary depending on the half-life of the tracer used. For perfusion imaging using technetium (half-life 6 hours) breast milk should be expressed for the first 24 hours following the scan. In theory, it need not be discarded but can safely be bottle-fed to the baby after these 24 hours have elapsed, however in practice many patients none-the-less choose to discard it.
Most tracers simply require adherence to a washout time but of note, the precautions following administration of Gallium-67 based tracers (most commonly used for pyrexia of unknown origin) are much more limiting and, practically speaking, unfortunately lead to complete cessation of breastfeeding. The half-life of Ga-67 is approximately 78 hours. Breastfeeding should, if time allows, be stopped for 2-4 weeks prior to the scan to allow the breast tissue to become less radiosensitive while the tracer circulates within the mother. Where this is an unacceptably long delay for the clinical state of the patient the study can be performed straight away anyway but in either case, milk should also be discarded for at least a further two weeks following the study. Clearly a disruption to breast-feeding of such a long time is far from ideal, even assuming that a patient who is sufficiently unwell as to need a PUO study is able to continue breast-feeding at all, and is likely to lead to complete cessation of breast-feeding. There are other ways to image PUO using Tc99m labelled white blood cells which can be considered.",FALSE,"A ventilation/ perfusion scan is the best test to perform next in this case because it is the most reliable and accurate test for diagnosing a pulmonary embolism.

This disease is thought to be a variant of psoriatic arthropathy.

Select ONE answer only.,SBA: Musculoskeletal and Trauma,C8,C6,C7,T1,T2,A,69%,1%,9%,18%,2%,"Explanation:
In the cervical spine the nerve roots exit at the spinal cord without needing to traverse (as in the lumbar spine). The exiting nerve root takes the name of the vertebra BELOW the affected disc. A disc protrusion at C3/4 will affect the C4 nerve root. This allows for the extra nerve root at C8 before reaching the thoracic spine.
In the thoracic spine the affected level takes its name from the vertebral body ABOVE that level. In the lumbar spine the exiting nerve root is usually compressed in the neural foramen, whereas the traversing nerve root is compressed usually in the lateral recess. Far lateral bulges affect the exiting nerve root (takes its name from the vertebral body ABOVE that level). Paracentral bulges affect the traversing nerve root (takes its name from the vertebral body BELOW that level).",FALSE,"The C7/T1 vertebral disc is seen to extrude posteriorly and efface the exiting nerve root.

Brown-Sequard syndrome
This is a specific finding where damage to to one side of the spinal cord causes ipsilateral loss of touch sensation and contralateral loss of pain and temperature sensation due to damage to the lateral spinothalamic tracts (contralateral since these ascend after having crossed). There is also ipsilateral motor function loss.
  Causes of Brown-Sequard syndrome
Traumatic:
Penetrating injury
Mechanical trauma e.g. RTA
Iatrogenic injury
Compression e.g. disc herniation
Spinal cord tumour
  Vascular:
Aortic aneurysm repair complication
Vertebral artery dissection
Spinal cord haemorrhage
  Spinal cord infarction
The vascular supply to the spinal cord is derived largely from the vertebral arteries or intercostal arteries with one longitudinal running anterior spinal cord artery and two small longitudinally running posterior spinal cord arteries.
The artery of Adamkiewicz is a particularly large segmental artery supplying the anterior spinal artery from around the level of T9. It is responsible for most of the spinal cord blood supply for the lumbar spinal cord. Damage during aortic surgery or trauma can result in spinal cord infarction.
Usually any vascular insult results in a reasonably rapid onset of symptoms. Spinal cord infarctions are no exception. Often more than one vertebral level is affected.
An MRI will showT2 hyperintensity of at least the central grey matter (if not the whole cross-section of the cord) due to oedema. As with intracranial infarctions there will be restriction of diffusion on the DWI sequences.
Particularly in the thoracic spine, the adjacent vertebral body may also lose its blood supply and undergo infarction.
  Subacute combined degeneration
This is a curious condition which can be subtle to detect. A deficiency of vitamin B12 (usually caused by malabsorption) leads to degeneration within the dorsal columns of the cord. The dorsal columns carry nerves responsible for position and vibration sense and as such patients present with loss of these senses as well as sensory ataxia (balance significantly deteriorates when the patient’s eyes are shut thereby excluding visual stabilisation as opposed to sensory stabilisation), and hyperreflexia.
On an MRI scan there will be (if the resolution allows), a longitudinal line of high T2 signal within the cord on sagittal sequences, and often a characteristic 'inverted-V' shape of high T2 signal on axial sequences. In some cases, the 'V' is clearly seen and in others it is harder to appreciate, and the finding is more of high T2 signal bilaterally and symmetrically in the region of the posterior columns.",FALSE,"I chose 4. Poly-trauma as the answer because Brown-Sequard Syndrome is caused by an injury to one side of the spinal cord, resulting in a loss of sensation on the contralateral side and a loss of power on the ipsilateral side.

11716,206687,You are performing an ultrasound scan on a 4-year-old boy who has recently been found to have a large abdominal mass. It is displacing the kidney inferiorly and encasing the aorta.

Both tumours can displace the kidney although this feature is more closely associated with neuroblastomas. Similarly both tumours can present with lung metastases but they are far more common with Wilms tumours. Wilms tumours can show heterogeneity which may be mistaken for renal cysts but otherwise neither are particularly associated with them. It is perfectly possible for neither tumour to show renal vein invasion.
This leaves encasement of the aorta which is a feature strongly associated with neuroblastoma.
  Neuroblastoma
This is the most common solid abdominal mass in infants and second most common in children of all ages (after Wilms tumours). Most are adrenal in location, around a third develop in the retroperitoneum and a fifth are located in the posterior mediastinum. Presentation can be with abdominal pain, a mass, or a fever. Most (95%) secrete catecholamines such as VMA (vanillylmandelic acid – leads to hypertension) or VIP (vasoactive intestinal polypeptides – leads to watery diarrhoea). There are also a few distinct clinical syndromes which herald the presence of a neuroblastoma.
  Syndrome
Details
Blueberry muffin syndrome
Metastatic cutaneous deposits
Opsomyoclonus
Rapid jerky eye movements and myoclonic jerks of the legs. This occurs in around 2% of neuroblastoma cases but around 50% of patients with opsomyoclonus have a neuroblastoma.
Hutchinson syndrome
Limping due to bony metastases
  On imaging they appear as a very large abdominal mass with or without speckled calcification within in. The kidney can either be invaded or just displaced inferiorly, causing a ‘drooping lily’ appearance on urography (where contrast within the inferiorly displaced renal calyces has the appearance of a lily flower with its head hanging down). Neuroblastomas tend to encase large vessels such as the IVC, as opposed to displacing them as Wilms tumours are prone to doing. Staging is performed with an 123I-MIBG scan (as opposed to a 99mTc-MDP bone scan) and importantly within the staging it is actually stage IVs (disease involving the skin, bone marrow and liver) which has the best prognosis.
  Wilms tumour also known as a nephroblastoma
This is the most common abdominal mass in children under the age of 8. There are reasonably strong associations with renal anomalies, genital anomalies, aniridia and Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (although the last of these also has an association with neuroblastoma). Presentation is usually with an abdominal mass and/or pain.

When his PSA is found to be markedly elevated he undergoes an MRI scan for further investigation. Which of the following regarding prostate cancer in the transitional zone is FALSE? Select ONE answer only.,"SBA: Genito urinary, Adrenal, Obstetrics & Gynaecology and Breast",A negative trans-rectal biopsy is reassuring,A non-circumscribed low T2 lesion is most likely to be cancer,Are usually organ-confined at presentation,Can be masked by BPH changes,Around 30% of prostate cancers occur in the transitional zone,A,79%,7%,4%,3%,8%,"Explanation:
Please note that the question asks which answer is FALSE.
Transitional zone cancers are less common than peripheral zone cancers but do occur and account for around 30% of prostate cancers. They are often harder to detect clinically due to their central location, and can be occult on imaging owing to overlap and confusion, in particular in patients with benign prostatic hypertrophy since it is the transitional zone which is involved in BPH. BPH leads to a heterogenous and enlarged appearance to the transitional zone which can obscure smaller lesions. On the plus side however, they are more often organ-confined since their central location effectively cushions them from capsular breach for longer. Their central location within the prostate cancer does however mean that trans-rectal biopsies may be falsely reassuring if negative, having missed the lesion due to lesion-depth within the prostate. Clinicians should have a low threshold for repeat-biopsies.
Peripheral zone
The highest grade of suspicion for malignancy in the peripheral zone is indicated by the presence of marked restricted diffusion (focal high b-value and corresponding low ADC signal), with a PIRADS 5 lesion being one that is greater than 1.5 cm. PIRADS 3 lesions will show some restricted diffusion but this is far less (subjective analysis) than for PIRADS 4 lesions. Dynamic contrast enhancement is used for assessment of peripheral zone lesions only - differentiating between lesions which show only limited restricted diffusion. If there is dynamic contrast enhancement with a type 3 washout curve, the lesion becomes a PIRADS 4 lesion despite the only limited restriction in diffusion.
Transitional zone
The highest grade of suspicion for transitional zone lesions is reserved for moderate T2 lesion which is lenticular or non-circumscribed and moderately T2 hypointense (PIRADS 5 >1.5 cm).
Three plane T2 imaging is common practice and enables full assessment of the peripheral zone of the prostate, particularly examining for extra-capsular extension, bladder base or seminal vesical invasion. T2 is also the most important sequence for lesions in the transitional zone.
The T1 weighted sequences are also useful to check for the presence of any haemorrhagic foci although since most patients now undergo their MRI scan prior to any biopsies being taken this has become far less important.
Interestingly the ADC map is more sensitive for carcinoma of the prostate (in the peripheral zone) than the DWI sequences. A finding of focal low signal on the ADC map may be seen in the absence of a corresponding high DWI focus. In the transitional zone however, the T2 sequences are more sensitive.",FALSE,"I chose 3.

What is the most likely diagnosis?,SBA: Paediatrics,Acquired cholesteatoma,Cholesterol granuloma,Epidermoid cyst,Congenital cholesteatoma,Chronic otitis media,A,47%,3%,1%,45%,5%,"Explanation:
Normally acquired cholesteatomas have an age association of >40years or so and therefore you could be forgiven for thinking the answer was a congenital cholesteatoma. However these tend to present in younger children (a few months old to 5yrs) so this patient does not fit particularly well into either category. Congenital cholesteatomas are less destructive than the acquired form but can cause bony remodelling. Cholesteatomas are histologically epidermoid cysts. This is also therefore 'correct' however the answer option of acquired cholesteatoma is more specific to the vignette and is therefore more correct.
Cholesterol granulomas are cystic structures with imaging features that belie their contents, namely cholesterol and blood. Hence they tend to show high signal on both T1 and t2. They tend not to be erosive/aggressive when located in the middle ear although this is a feature which is seen when they are situated in the petrous apex.",TRUE,"I chose this answer because acquired cholesteatoma is the most common type of erosive soft tissue mass found in the middle ear in patients with a history of impaired hearing. It is a noncancerous growth of skin cells that can form in the middle ear and can cause hearing loss, dizziness, and facial nerve paralysis.",2,,A,TRUE,,A,FALSE,E

MRI is seldom used in the world of pulmonary radiology. Nonetheless the physics is the same throughout the body in that there are a limited number of entities which show high signal on T1.
These are the 4Ms and the 3Fs, thus:

Mineralisation (manganese, copper)
Magnevist (gadolinium contrast agents)

Arguably renal cell carcinoma metastases could cause high T1 signal since they can show haemorrhage however the clinical information in the question alludes to the patient having occupational exposure to sunlight predisposing him to melanoma formation.",FALSE,"Mycobacterium Avium Intracellulare is the most likely diagnosis because it is the most common cause of nodular pericardial thickening with high signal on T1 and low on T2 associated with a small pericardial effusion.

11416,206687,"A 39-year-old man complains to his GP of a lump in his scrotum. He is referred for an ultrasound scan which shows that there is a hypoechoic multilocular lesion at the head of the epididymis. On close inspection, there is echogenic moving material within. What is the most likely diagnosis?","SBA: Genito urinary, Adrenal, Obstetrics & Gynaecology and Breast",Spermatocoele,Epididymal cyst,Rete testis ectasia,Tunica albuginea cyst,Intratesticular cyst,A,87%,9%,3%,1%,1%,"Explanation:
Spermatocoele
A spermatocoele is a focal dilatation of a duct within the head of the epididymis. Since they contain protein debris and spermatozoa, low level echoes can be seen floating within them differentiating them from epididymal cysts. They are essentially an incidental asymptotic finding. 
  Epididymal cyst
A cystic structure within the epididymis is most commonly a simple cyst. They can present as palpable masses or be found incidentally. On ultrasound they behave as you might expect from a cyst, with posterior acoustic enhancement of an anechoic round structure. The main differential diagnosis is a spermatocoele which, unlike a simple cyst, usually contains echogenic material. The latter is usually only found in the epididymal head. 
  Rete testis ectasia
This is a relatively common finding in men around the age of 60. It is asymptomatic and therefore incidental. The rete testis is the name given to the tubules which collect spermatozoa from the seminiferous tubules and deliver them to the extra-testicular ducts. The normal rete testis is too small to appreciate with ultrasound but when, through age, the distal portion becomes stenosed, there is buildup of fluid within the rete testis. This is then seen as tubular branching anechoic structures within the testis.
  Tunica albuginea cyst
The tunica albuginea is a fibrous layer covering the testicle. On ultrasound it appears as the thin echogenic line surrounding the testicle. When cysts form here they are usually palpable as small well-defined lumps a few millimetres in diameter. Appearances on ultrasound usually conform to those expected from any straightforward cyst i.e. An sharply defined anechoic structure with acoustic enhancement posteriorly. They can be uni or multilocular and although they can exert mass effect on the underlying testicle they do not affect the testicular tissue beyond this. They are most commonly located at the anterosuperior or superolateral aspect of the testicle.
  Intratesticular cyst
These are not readily palpable and therefore are seen only as incidental findings. They demonstrate the usual characteristics of any cyst on ultrasound but are located within the testicle itself. They are inconsequential but for their distinction from cystic teratomas. The latter will have solid enhancing components on an MRI scan. Provided, however, there is no ambiguity on ultrasound, no further follow up would be needed for a straightforward intratesticular cyst.
  Seminoma
Germ cell tumours are divided into seminomas and non-seminomatous varieties. They are very common and comprise almost half of all testicular tumours. They can often be found incidentally or subsequent to any trauma which might cause the patient to self-examine and discover a testicular lump. Alternatively they can present as a vague dull scrotal aching sensation with no lump.
Lymphatic drainage is to the retroperitoneum. Para-aortic lymph nodes are therefore regional. Involvement of the internal, external and common iliac nodes however, is considered non-regional. Only if there has been previous scrotal or inguinal surgery disrupting tissue planes are inguinal or external iliac artery nodes considered regional.
They typically are found in patients in their 40s. Testicular tumours can be diagnosed with a strong pre-test probability based solely on age as detailed in the table below. On ultrasound there will be an intratesticular low reflectivity well-defined mass. Colour doppler flow can be seen within the mass.

What is the most likely diagnosis?",SBA: Central Nervous and Head & Neck,Paraganglioma,Jugular foramen metastasis,Neural sheath tumour,Meningioma,PNET,A,77%,11%,4%,3%,6%,"Explanation:
Vernet syndrome is the name for a collection of symptoms caused by pathology at the jugular foramen and consequentially affecting cranial nerves IX, X and XI ie. Loss of taste to the posterior third of the tongue, vocal cord paralysis, dysphasia, weakness of sternocleidomastoid and trapezius.
There is a differential diagnosis for such pathology the identification of which will depend on the further imaging features provided. This question could easily be asked in a way to point to any of the other diagnoses provided.
A jugular foramen metastasis will be destructive and infiltrating with possible enlargement or pathological enhancement of the nerve roots and obliteration of normal fat planes. No particular history of a primary malignancy has been offered though.
A paraganglioma (or glomus jugulare tumour) is the most common cause of Vernet syndrome. This will cause infiltration of the connective tissue planes following the path of least resistance. There can be a moth eaten pattern of temporal bone destruction with associated ossicular destruction and consequential hearing loss. A so-called ‘salt and pepper’ appearance is classical.
A neural sheath tumour (ie a schwannoma or neurofibroma) will cause smooth scalloping of the adjacent bone.
A meningioma will have classical meningioma features (Extra-axial mass appearing isodense on CT with avid enhancement post-contrast, variable signal characteristics on MRI with avid enhancement post-contrast). Bony hyperostosis may be seen.
A PNET in this area would more usually present as a progressive bulbar palsy and appears as a destructive mass causing irregular bony destruction.",TRUE,"Paragangliomas are typically seen on MRI as irregular masses with bony erosion, low signal on T1, high signal on T2, and marked enhancement post-contrast.

14415,206687,You are reviewing a trauma CT scan for a 36-year-old patient following a multi-vehicle accident. There is an obvious pelvic fracture with active haemorrhage from an internal iliac vein tributary. How should this best be managed? Select ONE answer only.,SBA: Cardiothoracic and vascular,Pelvic binder,Angiogram and embolisation,Pelvic binder then angiogram,Laparoscopic surgery,Laparotomy,A,29%,38%,28%,1%,4%,"Explanation:
Please note that the vignette describes a venous bleeding point.
Arterial bleeding from pelvic fractures
Pelvic fractures in the context of trauma are a cause of significant morbidity and mortality. Life threatening haemorrhage may be caused by arterial bleeding or other sources such as the fractured bones themselves, and the pelvic venous structures. External fixation is one of the few means of managing acute haemorrhage in the pre-hospital setting however for arterial bleeding it is far less effective at tamponading ongoing haemorrhage. It remains the treatment of choice for bone bleeding or venous bleeding.
Catheter angiography and embolisation is the most effective method to control arterial haemorrhage. If the patient is haemodynamically unstable due to an arterial pelvic haemorrhage, catheter embolisation still provides the best hope for managing the patient successfully. Even if the patient has abdominal injuries which are likely to necessitate open abdominal trauma surgery, studies have shown that arterial pelvic bleeding should still be controlled via catheter embolisation prior to their open surgery.",FALSE,The best way to manage this injury is to perform an angiogram and embolisation. An angiogram is an imaging procedure that uses a contrast dye to visualize the blood vessels and identify any blockages or areas of active bleeding. Embolisation is a minimally invasive procedure that involves injecting a material into the blood vessels to stop the flow of blood. This is the most effective way to stop the active haemorrhage from the iliac vein tributary. Pelvic binders and laparoscopic surgery are not effective for this type of injury. Laparotomy is a more invasive procedure and should only be used as a last resort.,2,"3. A question about clinical management, what is the best treatment?

Select ONE answer only.,SBA: Cardiothoracic and vascular,His renal function is poor,His last dose of insulin was one hours previously,He had a black coffee that morning,He went to the gym the previous afternoon,He has fasted for less than 4 hours,A,56%,11%,14%,15%,5%,"Explanation:
Please note that the question asks which answer is NOT a reason to delay or reschedule the scan.
FDG imaging relies on glucose uptake being increased in tissues of interest which are more metabolically active than non-target tissues. Hence the patient must be fasted such that the FDG given is taken up rapidly enough to produce an image.
FDG is renally excreted. Patients with a poor renal function are at risk of enduring a higher dose than those with a normal renal function. However, assuming the dose is correctly adjusted down there is no reason such patients cannot undergo PET/CT scanning.
Insulin treatment does not preclude imaging, and indeed helps reduce the extracellular glucose concentration thereby improving the quality of scans acquired later. There should be at least a 4-hour gap between the last insulin dose and the FDG tracer dose time.
The literature on fasting varies and different organizations have suggested slightly different fasting windows. The most conservative of these is 6 hours.
Caffeine, alcohol and nicotine must be avoided for at least 12 hours prior to the scan.
Exercise should be avoided for 24, if not 48 hours prior to the scan.",FALSE,"I chose 3 because drinking a black coffee that morning would interfere with the accuracy of the FDG exam, as it can cause an increase in glucose levels.

Hysterosalpingogram (HSG)
HSGs are performed in the setting of infertility to confirm or refute tubal patency. It is not the ideal modality to diagnose MDAs since it provides information only on the internal contours of any patent cavities. Historically the intercornual angle was used to differentiate between a septate uterus (<75o) and a bicornuate or didelphys uterus (>105o) but this is no longer considered reliable. In addition an HSG will overlook obstructed hemisystems or functional remnants which do not communicate with the vagina.
Active pelvic inflammation, contrast allergy and pregnancy are all contraindications to performing a hysterosalpingogram.

  Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID)
This is a coverall term applied to ascending infection of the genital tract. It encompasses endometriosis, salpingitis, hydrosalpinx, pyosalpinx, and tubo-ovarian abscesses. Chlamydia and gonorrhoea account of most of the cases and the disease is most prevalent in sexually active young people. Imaging features are those secondary to inflammation with increased vascularity to the endometrium and small volume ascites. Inflammation is also seen on MRI as avid enhancement post contrast. Pelvic inflammatory disease can be complicated by a condition called Fitz-Hugh-Curtis syndrome where there is perihepatitis secondary to PID. ",TRUE,"I chose number 2 because pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) is an infection of the reproductive organs, and it can cause inflammation and scarring of the fallopian tubes, which can interfere with the passage of the dye used in the hysterosalpingogram.

Both tumours can displace the kidney although this feature is more closely associated with neuroblastomas. Wilms tumours can show heterogeneity which may be mistaken for renal cysts but otherwise neither are particularly associated with them. It is perfectly possible for neither tumour to show renal vein invasion.
Encasement of the aorta which is a feature strongly associated with neuroblastoma.
This leaves curvilinear calcification. Although more commonly seen with neuroblastomas, both tumours can show calcification. The morphology differs between the two however with curvilinear calcification being a feature of Wilms tumours.
  Wilms tumour also known as a nephroblastoma
This is the most common abdominal mass in children under the age of 8. There are reasonably strong associations with renal anomalies, genital anomalies, aniridia and Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (although the last of these also has an association with neuroblastoma). Presentation is usually with an abdominal mass and/or pain.

  On imaging they appear as a very large abdominal mass with or without speckled calcification within in. The kidney can either be invaded or just displaced inferiorly, causing a ‘drooping lily’ appearance on urography (where contrast within the inferiorly displaced renal calyces has the appearance of a lily flower with its head hanging down). Neuroblastomas tend to encase large vessels such as the IVC, as opposed to displacing them as Wilms tumours are prone to doing.

Select ONE answer only.",SBA: Central Nervous and Head & Neck,Bright on T1 and dark on T2 = Early subacute,Dark on T1 and isointense on T2 = Chronic,Dark on T1 and dark on T2 = Hyperacute,Isointense on T1 and bright on T2 = Acute,Bright on T1 and isointense on T2 = Late Subacute,A,79%,3%,3%,9%,5%,"Explanation:
This question is to do with the imaging characteristics of blood within the brain. We can think of the intracranial space as a closed box as far as oxygen tensions go which means that blood degrades in a predictable fashion and therefore has predictable appearances on T1 and T2 according to the changes in the haemoglobin molecule. There are a few different methods to help remember the changes in appearance, one of which is the table below:
  Time-frame Haemoglobin T1 T2 Mnemonic
Hyperacute (hours)   Iso Bright - IBBY
Acute (0-2 days) Intracellular deoxyHb Dark / Iso Dark - IDDY
Early subacute (3-7 days) Intracellular metHb Bright Dark - BIDDY
Late subacute (8-30 days) Extracellular metHb Bright Bright - BABY
Chronic (> 30 days) Intracellular haemosiderin Dark Dark rim - DODO
  In real life and for the 2b exam the important distinction is around the subacute stages.
In that case, by and large, if it is bright on T1 it is subacute and T2 then decides if it is early or late subacute. The timeframes given are also important and can form the basis of 2a exam questions.
  Of the other answers provided therefore:
Bright on T1 and dark on T2 = Early subacute
Dark on T1 and bright on T2 = Chronic
Dark on T1 and dark on T2 = Acute
Isointense on T1 and bright on T2 = Hyperacute
Bright on T1 and bright on T2 = Late subacute",FALSE,"I chose this answer because on MRI scans, blood appears isointense on T1 and bright on T2 in acute bleeds.

Anterior dislocation (95%)
The integrity of the shoulder joint is weakest when at extreme abduction and external rotation.
When the humeral head dislocates anteriorly with respect to the glenoid, the posterolateral aspect of the humeral head impacts on the inferior glenoid and both can suffer. The damage to the humeral head is known as a Hill-Sachs lesion and the inferior glenoid fracture is called a Bankart lesion.
  Posterior dislocation (5%)
At extreme abduction with internal rotation the humeral head is forced posteriorly and can dislocate. The usual scenario is in the context of a seizure or alternatively when a patient has been electrocuted. The AP x-ray can seem normal to the untrained eye. If the humerus remains internally rotated, the greater tuberosity rotates to a more anterior position and its characteristic outline is lost, leading to the so-called ‘light-bulb’ sign of a posterior dislocation. To establish the relationship between the humeral head and the glenoid, a Y-view, where the glenoid is viewed head-on, is often performed but an axillary view, where the beam travels through the axilla, is said to be even more useful. Avulsion fractures of the lesser tuberosity (where the subscapularis muscle attaches) are commonly seen in association with posterior dislocations.
A bony defect on the anteromedial surface of the humeral head is known as reverse Hill-Sachs lesion. Similarly a tear to the posterior glenoid labrum is called a reverse Bankart lesion.

The patient presents with their arm held over their head. X-rays will show the humeral head displaced downwards and caught underneath the glenoid.",FALSE,"I chose this answer because it is the most likely abnormality demonstrated on plain films following reduction of an anterior shoulder dislocation.

14312,206687,You are performing an ultrasound scan on a 27-year-old lady. She has presented with severe abdominal pain and is on day 7 of her menstrual cycle. You suspect she may have ovarian torsion. Which of the following regarding this diagnosis is correct? Select ONE answer only.,"SBA: Genito urinary, Adrenal, Obstetrics & Gynaecology and Breast",Torsion is more common during early pregnancy,The most common cause of ovarian torsion is a dermoid cyst,The diagnosis is excluded by the presence of doppler flow in the ovary,The ovary will be smaller than normal,Small fluid pockets seen around the edge of the ovary suggest an alternative diagnosis,A,56%,36%,2%,2%,4%,"Explanation:
Ovarian torsion
At least half of all ovarian torsion is caused by a lead point (i.e. an ovarian mass). Most cases are due to a corpus luteum cyst or follicular cyst with a dermoid cyst being the next most common cause. Torsion is also more common during early pregnancy than in non-pregnant patients. On ultrasound the ovary itself will be enlarged (>4cm in length), and heterogenously echogenic. In the periphery of the ovary, small fluid-filled follicles may be appreciated. On doppler ultrasound scan, twisting of the ovarian pedicle is a useful sign but actual flow within the ovary itself does not exclude torsion since it is venous flow which is lost first.
Symptoms may resolve spontaneously with de-torsion but otherwise laparoscopy is indicated to de-tort the ovary and remove any lead point. If the ovary is infarcted at the time of surgery this will also be resected.
  Mature teratoma
(Immature) teratomas and dermoid cysts (mature teratomas) have very similar imaging characteristics despite their histological differences. Teratomas are the most common ovarian neoplasm but are slow growing and usually benign. By contrast immature teratomas are malignant. The presence of fat is a strong indicator for a mature teratoma with the combination of fat, fluid and calcification being highly specific. On MRI the fat will show the usual signal drop-out on fat saturated sequences. Calcification will show as low signal on T2. Although benign, mature teratomas can be complicated by torsion or rupture. Malignant degeneration if it does occur, is to squamous cell carcinoma most commonly.
Mature teratomas can have a variety of appearances on ultrasound scan depending on their internal composition. Posterior acoustic shadowing suggests the presence of calcification.
  The corpus luteum
The corpus luteum consists of the remnant of a ruptured ovarian follicle following ovulation. It produces oestrogen and progesterone to sustain a pregnancy following fertilisation. On ultrasound it is seen as a thick-walled cyst with peripheral vascularity on colour Doppler flow. This 'ring of fire' appearance can be confused with an ectopic pregnancy.",FALSE,"I chose this answer because the presence of doppler flow in the ovary is an important indication that ovarian torsion is not present.

Which of the following will help establish the diagnosis of a metastasis over that of an abscess for this patient?,SBA: Paediatrics,A thick nodular enhancing wall,The lesion restricts diffusion,"Vasogenic oedema, not cytotoxic oedema",The histopathology of the known primary,The absence of calcification,A,56%,14%,12%,10%,7%,"Explanation:
There is a mnemonic for ring enhancing lesions. MAGIC DR (Metastasis, abscess, glioma, infarction, contusion, demyelination, radiation necrosis). Largely however the differential diagnosis is between a metastasis and an abscess.
An abscess tends to show a thin smooth rim of enhancement whereas mitotic lesions often have a thick, irregular margin. These patterns are not exact but can be taken as good evidence to support/refute either diagnosis. Obviously correlation should be made with the presence or absence of markers of infection which have been deliberately omitted from the vignette.
The central liquefied portion of an abscess characteristically shows restriction in diffusion due to the high viscosity of the pus. However, some cerebral metastases, specifically those from a neuroblastoma, can also show some restriction in diffusion owing to the highly cellular nature of the lesions. Unfortunately, while the difference between the two should be obvious when reviewing images, the question does not elaborate as to the extent of the restriction in diffusion.

The carpal tunnel is a passageway on the palmar side of the wrist that connects the forearm to the middle compartment of the deep plane of the hand.
The carpal tunnel is formed by two layers, the carpal arch and the flexor retinaculum:
1. The carpal arch forms the floor of the carpal tunnel. It is concave on the palmar side and is formed laterally by the scaphoid and trapezium tubercles and medially by the hook of the hamate and the pisiform bones.
2. The flexor retinaculum forms the roof of the carpal tunnel. It is a strong, fibrous band that covers the carpal bones on the palmar side of the hand near the wrist. It is attached medially to the pisiform bone and the hook of the hamate bone. Laterally it attaches to the tubercle of the scaphoid bone, and to the medial part of the trapezium bone.
The carpal tunnel contains a total of nine flexor tendons (but not the muscles themselves), surrounded by a synovial sheath, and the median nerve. The tendons contained within the carpal tunnel are:
Flexor digitorum profundus (four tendons)
Flexor digitorum superficialis (four tendons)
Flexor pollicis longus (one tendon)
  The eight tendons of the flexor digitorum profundus and superficialis are surrounded by a single synovial sheath, whereas the tendon of flexor pollicis longus is surrounded by its own synovial sheath. These sheaths allow free movement of the tendons
The tendon of flexor carpi radialis does not pass through the carpal tunnel, but is instead located within the flexor retinaculum itself.
The ulnar artery and ulnar nerve pass superficial to the flexor retinaculum and the carpal tunnel, passing through the ulnar tunnel.
Carpal tunnel syndrome is an entrapment neuropathy of the median nerve. It causes weakness and parasthesia in the distribution of the median nerve. The muscles innervated by the median nerve can be remembered using the mnemonic ‘LOAF’:

O – Opponens pollicis
A – Abductor pollicis
F – Flexor pollicis brevis

Oesophagitis
Inflammation of the oesophagus usually presents with severe pain on swallowing (odynophagia). There are many different aetiologies but there are a few features which can help separate the differential diagnoses on imaging.
Aetiology
Features
Candidiasis
Immunocompromised patients (including long term steroid therapy)
Upper half of the oesophagus
Irregular, longitudinal plaques with normal mucosa in between
Fulminant candidiasis
Patients with AIDs
Shaggy outline from a pseudomembrane of joined-together plaques
Herpes simplex
Immunocompromised patients
Flu-like symptoms
Multiple small ulcers, each may have a halo of oedema
CMV / HIV oesophagitis
One large ulcer
These two are indistinguishable from one another by appearance
Caustic
Ingestion of corrosive substance
Affects middle and lower thirds
Progression from oedema to ulceration to scarring over days
Barrett oesophagitis
Squamous metaplasia of distal oesophagus in response to reflux
Long strictures
Reticular mucosal pattern
Drug-induced
Ulcers at sites of extrinsic compression in the mid oesophagus
Patients taking medication without enough water immediately prior to going to bed
Idiopathic eosinophilic oesophagitis
History of atopy usually present
Specific ring-like indentations to the oesophagus
  Glycogen acanthosis
This condition is caused by benign age-related squamous hyperplasia but, based on its imaging features, a differential diagnosis for candidiasis. On a barium swallow there will be small rounded white plaques in a random distribution, predominantly affecting the middle and upper oesophagus. Patients are typically middle aged or elderly.
  Intramural pseudodiverticulosis
This is a feature of candidal oesophagitis. Tiny diverticulae are found scattered along the length of the oesophagus and on a barium swallow the appearance can be quite impressive! Like most candidal infections oesophagitis is most common in patients with suppressed immunity including patients with diabetes, on steroids, or chemotherapy.",TRUE,"Caustic oesophagitis is the most likely diagnosis due to the presence of numerous linear ulcers affecting the middle and lower thirds of the oesophagus. These linear ulcers are typically seen in caustic oesophagitis, as they are caused by the corrosive action of an ingested caustic substance (e.g. lye, bleach, etc.). Other causes of oesophagitis, such as CMV, drug-induced, and Candida albicans, are less likely to cause linear ulcers. Intramural pseudodiverticulosis is a condition characterized by outpouchings of the oesophageal wall, and is not associated with linear ulcers.",2,,A,FALSE,,C,FALSE,C
14308,207854,A 28-year-old woman presents acutely unwell. Of note in her medical history she has been taking the oral contraceptive pill. She undergoes a CT scan which shows high density of the superior sagittal sinus. An MRI is requested for follow-up. Which of the following is a pitfall of sagittal sinus thrombosis imaging? Select ONE answer only.,SBA: Central Nervous and Head & Neck,Sinus flow artefact on TOF,Empty delta sign on post contrast CT,Dense triangle sign on unenhanced CT,Blooming artefact on GRE,High intensity in the sinus on T1,A,76%,4%,3%,10%,8%,"Explanation:
The empty delta sign is a post-contrast CT finding. Bilateral haemorrhages can be a secondary consequence to a sagittal sinus thrombosis which may point towards the diagnosis but the thrombosis itself is recognised by the empty delta sign on post-contrast CT.
Dense triangle sign pertains to the acute thrombus as it appears on an unenhanced CT scan.
On an MRI, static blood within the sagittal sinus gives rise to low signal on T1, although the thrombus itself is likely to be high in signal (if subacute in nature). Normally the sagittal sinus will appear as a flow void on T1w. Blooming artefact can be seen on T2* gradient echo sequences and is a strong indicatory of the diagnosis. Confusion can arise with time-of-flight 3D reformatted images and great care should be taken not to overdiagnose flow artefactas thrombosis. Careful reference should always be made to the source images and where there is doubt a CT venogram may be of more use.
The associated infarctions can often be haemorrhagic and parasagittal haemorrhages are very specific for a sagittal sinus thrombosis, but subarachnoid haemorrhage is not likely to be related.",FALSE,"The dense triangle sign is a pitfall of sagittal sinus thrombosis imaging because it is an artifactual finding that can appear on unenhanced CT scans and can be mistaken for a thrombus. This sign is caused by the overlap of the edges of the transverse sinus and the sigmoid sinus, creating an appearance of a triangle. This sign should not be mistaken for an actual thrombus, which would show up as a high-density area on CT or a high-intensity area on MRI.",1,"3.

10441,207854,An 85-year-old man is found to have lymphangitis carcinomatosis. What is the most likely description of the nodules that have been seen as part of this condition?,SBA: Cardiothoracic and vascular,Subpleural,Peribronchial,Fissural,Intraplural,Perihilar,A,24%,32%,38%,3%,3%,"Explanation:
This question is challenging because when describing the CT findings in lymphangitis carcinomatosis it is usually the interstitial and fissural thickening which are of greatest significance. However, nodules can and do occur and when they do they are most commonly found in the subpleural location.
----------------
Lung nodules seen on CT take one of three different patterns:
Perilymphatic nodules
Peribronchiolar, perivascular, subpleural and close to the fissures
Lymphangitis carcinomatosis, sarcoidosis, pneumoconioses
Centrilobular nodules
Found in the centre of the secondary pulmonary lobule, with subpleural sparing
Infections, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, vasculitis
Random
Miliary disease, metastatic disease, langerhans cell histiocytosis
Subpleural nodules are associated with the secondary pulmonary lobule and nodules here represent a perilymphatic distribution such as would be expected with lymphangitis carcinomatosis. They can also be seen in usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP) or idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF).
Fissural nodules are usually isolated and feature heavily in the lung MDT with follow up CT scans arranged according to the British Thoracic Society guidelines. Fissural thickening is associated with lymphangitis carcinomatosis, this can be smooth or nodular thickening but the nodularity is as part of the overall thickening rather than as discrete nodules.
Perihilar is a term usually used to refer to either cardiogenic or non-cardiogenic in origin. A perihilar distribution of airspace shadowing is also a classical description for Pneumocystis Carinii Pneumonia (PCP).
Peribronchial is a term usually coupled with cuffing and refers to opacification surrounding the larger airways which may be resultant from either oedema or bronchial inflammation (e.g asthma).
Intrapleural is not a classic descriptor for pulmonary pathology. Disease affecting the periphery of the chest are classified as either extrapleural or pleural meaning they either don’t or do affect the pleura.
Lymphangitis carcinomatosis is easy to recognize on a scan but can be described in a number of different ways on paper. It occurs when tumour cells, spread via the lymphatics, accumulate in the connective tissues of the lung, in particular the interlobular septa. The classical description is as a smooth thick reticular polygonal network.
A mnemonic for the likely cancers is: Certain Cancers Spread By Plugging The Lymphatics (this is not an exclusive list). Of these Breast accounts for just over half of cases and gastric cancer accounts for most of the remainder.

10351,207854,"A 61-year-old lady with a fever, weight loss and night sweats undergoes a CXR which shows a widened mediastinum. A subsequent CT shows a lobulated 8cm anterior mediastinal mass. What is the most likely diagnosis?",SBA: Cardiothoracic and vascular,Hodgkin lymphoma,Malignant thymoma,Malignant germ cell tumour,Lipoma,Non-Hodgkin lymphoma,A,62%,10%,2%,0%,25%,"Explanation:
The ‘5Ts’ of anterior mediastinal masses are a useful aide memoire:
Thymoma
Thyroid tumours
Teratoma
Thoracic aorta
Terrible lymphoma
  Hodgkin lymphoma
Hodgkin lymphoma has two age peaks in prevalence, one in the late 20s and one in the late 70s. It can present at any age however. If a histological finding of Reed-Sternberg cells (binucleate white cells) is given there can be no other diagnosis. Hodgkin lymphoma tends to cause anterior mediastinal masses whereas Non-hodgkin lymphoma tends to cause posterior mediastinal masses. Hodgkin lymphoma nodal involvement spreads contiguously from one region to the next. This makes the staging very easy to remember.
Stage I = one nodal group involved
Stage II = two or more nodal groups involved on the same side of the diaphragm
Stage III = nodal groups on either side of the diaphragm
Stage IV = involvement of non-lymphatic structures (e.g. bone or lung)
  Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL)
NHL is 4 times more prevalent than Hodgkin lymphoma. Thoracic lymph node enlargement is common and classically affects the posterior mediastinum. Unlike Hodgkin lymphoma, NHL demonstrates non-contiguous spread and thus the whole neck, chest, abdomen and pelvis should be included in staging imaging.
The following table summarises some of the imaging features separating the two diagnoses:
    Hodgkin lymphoma
Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma

  Malignant thymoma
These tumours spread by invading the mediastinum and encasing the lung with pleural thickening. Vascular invasion is also seen. The collateral features described fit better with Hodgkin lymphoma; for an association with myasthenia gravis there would more usually be weakness and fatigue symptoms with lid lag and diplopia also commonly described. The presence of any pleural deposits would be a good feature to suggest a malignant thymoma over some of the other possible options.
  Malignant germ cell tumour
These include seminomas and non-seminomatous (embryonal, yolk sac, choriocarcinoma, mixed cell type) tumours. Generally speaking they affect young adults and an elevated hCG, LDH, or alpha fetoprotein is usually present. The presence of effusions suggests local pleural invasion and may well be seen. Although the presence or absence of calcification is not featured in this question, the lack of calcification is in-keeping with seminomatous tumours.
  Lipoma
Lipomas are usually easily distinguished by their fat content, giving negative Hounsfield units. No Hounsfield units have been provided here but the remainder of the clinical information provided would not be explained by a lipoma.",FALSE,"The most likely diagnosis in this case is Malignant Thymoma because it is the most common type of anterior mediastinal mass in adults, especially in those over the age of 40.

What is the most likely explanation?,SBA: Cardiothoracic and vascular,Neurofibromatosis,Bronchogenic carcinoma,Lymphoma,Extramedullary haematopoiesis,Marfan syndrome,A,91%,1%,2%,6%,1%,"Explanation:
Dumbbell protrusion of a spinal mass through the neural foramina is a classic description for a neurofibroma. The slow growth of this lesion means there is bony remodeling around it rather than invasion. Neurogenic tumours are the most common cause of a posterior mediastinal mass.
A bronchogenic carcinoma – this would be more likely to invade bone as opposed to remodel it
Lymphoma – this is unlikely to be as isolated a finding as a solitary 3cm mass
Extramedullary haematopoiesis – this would usually also be expected to be multi-level
Marfan syndrome – this is associated with dural ectasia which can in turn also be seen in neurofibromatosis. Dural ectasia causes posterior vertebral body scalloping though, not unilateral dumbbell expansion of the foramina.
Other possible posterior mediastinal masses would be:
Thoracic aortic aneurysm
Ewing sarcoma – aggressive
Lymphoma – multi-level
Paraspinal abscess – unlikely to cause bony remodeling",TRUE,Neurofibromatosis is a genetic disorder that is characterized by the development of tumors along the nerves of the body. The presence of a 3cm paraspinal mass with a dumbbell shape and extending into the spinal canal is indicative of neurofibromatosis.

The radiologist reports the bowel to be of normal calibre throughout. Which of the following would best fit with these findings?,SBA: Gastrointestinal,Whipple disease,Scleroderma,Mastocytosis,Lymphoma,Eosinophilic enteropathy,A,62%,8%,18%,7%,6%,"Explanation:
Fold thickness
Much is made on barium examinations, of the thickness of the folds and whether there is any nodularity. Such features can be helpful in teasing apart the possible diagnoses in similar cases.
Coeliac disease – dilatation without increase in fold thickness
Scleroderma – dilatation without loss of valvulae conniventes, prolonged transit time
Zollinger-Ellison syndrome – dilatation of the proximal small bowel due to hypersecretion
Small bowel lymphoma – fold thickening and lymph node enlargement
Mastocytosis – nodular fold thickening with sclerotic bone lesions
Crohn disease – nodular fold thickening
Whipple disease – thickened folds (+/- microndularity) without dilatation, with normal transit time
  Whipple disease also known as intestinal lipodystrophy
Infection with Tropheryma whipplei causes a migratory arthralgia with jejunal fold thickening leading to malabsorption and is known as Whipple disease. Skin hyperpigmentation is often described and peripheral lymph nodes may be enlarged. Micronodularity does occur on the thickened folds but crucially there is little or no small bowel dilatation and a normal transit time. Obstruction of the lymphatics leads to low density lymph nodes appearing on CT. PAS positive macrophages confirm the infection.
  Differential diagnosis for lymph nodes of low attenuation
Coeliac disease – cavitating mesenteric lymph node syndrome
Tuberculosis
Whipple disease
Lymphoma
Necrotic metastases
  Small bowel lymphoma
Malignancies of the small bowel are rare but lymphoma is the most common of these. Coeliac disease, infection with H. Pylori and AIDs both predispose patients to developing small bowel lymphoma. Perhaps surprisingly patients do not present with obstruction even when the tumour burden is large, similarly neoplastic perforation is not common. Instead patients present with insidious symptoms or haemorrhage. On imaging there is (sometimes extensive) thickening of the bowel wall, often with associated lymph node enlargement.
  Mastocytosis
Mast cells store histamine (among other things). Where they exist in excess the resultant symptoms fit with excess histamine release. Patients complain of nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, hypotension, flushing and abdominal pain. Asthma-type symptoms can also occur. On imaging hepatosplenomegaly and lymph node enlargement are common. The walls of the small bowel become thickened and malabsorption occurs too. Mastocytosis is also a cause of bony sclerosis.

Hyperparathyroidism
Congenital
Pyknodysostosis
Osteopetrosis
Malignant
Lymphoma
Leukaemia
Haematological
Sickle cell disease
Myelofibrosis
Mastocytosis

Fluorosis
Paget disease
  Eosinophilic enteropathy
This is a rare condition caused by infiltration of eosinophils into the wall of the small bowel. Patients often suffer from food allergies and experience multiple attacks of abdominal pain, diarrhoea and vomiting in a relapsing/remitting pattern. Blood eosinophil levels are usually raised. On imaging the folds of the small bowel can appear thickened.
  Scleroderma
Scleroderma is a multi-system connective tissue disease leading to fibrosis and loss of smooth muscle. In the gastrointestinal system this leads to the hidebound sign (similar but different to stacked coin sign which is seen in intramural haematoma where the folds are thickened) where, despite being dilated in calibre, the small bowel still retains the valvulae conniventes which would otherwise be effaced. This is thought to result from fibrosis of the longitudinal layer causing foreshortening along the long axis. In the small bowel there can also be the formation of square-shaped broad-based sacculations (true-diverticulae because they involve all layers of the bowel wall) on the mesenteric border of the bowel is seen owing to uneven atrophy of the smooth muscle there. A prolonged transit time would be ususal. Pseudosacculations (wide-mouthed diverticulae) are found in the colon but this time on the antimesenteric border. (The *only* anti-mesenteric diverticulum of the small bowel is a Meckel's diverticulum.)
 ",FALSE,"I chose 3. Lymphoma because the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are suggestive of a lymphoproliferative disorder. Enlarged lymph nodes in the neck and groin are a common symptom of lymphoma, as is weight loss and darkening skin.

Cystic Fibrosis
This is causes bronchiectasis but predominantly affects the upper lobes. Presentation, if not before this point, is with recurrent chest infections. Otherwise it can present in the neonatal period with a meconium plug causing meconium ileus. (Meconium plug syndrome is very similar insofar as their is large bowel obstruction by meconium but relates to a pathologically small left colon instead and usually resolves with no long term sequela). In both cases Adults often suffer from subfertility, pancreatitis and malabsorption.
  Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia
This predominantly causes bronchiectasis in the middle and lower lobes. Only 50% have Kartagener’s syndrome (A triad of situs inversus, sinusitis and bronchiectasis), hence the normal heart position in the question. Affected men are infertile, and women are subfertile.
  ABPA
This is generally only seen in asthmatics and is characterised by central bronchiectasis particularly in the mid-zones and sometimes upper zones. Centrilobular nodules are also a feature.
  Aspiration

The trachea marks the start of the tracheobronchial tree, arising at the lower border of the cricoid cartilage, as a continuation of the larynx. This is at the C6 vertebral level.
It travels inferiorly into the superior mediastinum, bifurcating at the level of the sternal angle to form the right and left bronchi. Inside the trachea, at the T5 vertebral level, there is a cartilaginous ridge called the carina of trachea that marks the point of bifurcation. During its descent the trachea is located anterior to the oesophagus and inclines slightly to the right.
Below the cricoid cartilage there are 15 to 20 incomplete C-shaped tracheal rings (tracheal cartilages), which are composed of hyaline cartilage, and serve to reinforce the front and sides of the trachea to protect and maintain the airway. The free ends of these rings are supported by the trachealis muscle.
The trachea and bronchi are lined by ciliated pseudostratified columnar epithelium, interspersed by goblet cells, which produce mucous. The combination of sweeping movements by the cilia and mucous from the goblet cells forms the functional mucociliary escalator, that traps particles and pathogens and moves them up and out of the airways to be swallowed and destroyed.

Normally metastatic deposits in the spine lead to low T1 signal and high T2 signal. There should be no signal drop out on fat saturated sequences in contrast to marrow reconversion where although red marrow will experience far less signal dropout than yellow marrow, there will still be some loss in signal owing to the fat content of both types of marrow.
Sclerotic or blastic metastases return little signal on either T1 or T2 weighted sequences. These include prostate, breast or TCC metastases among others.
Breast cancer can cause lytic or sclerotic metastases or a mixed picture.
Lytic metastases are more likely than sclerotic metastases to enhance with contrast. Similarly on DWI imaging, whereas lytic metastases will usually appear hyperintense, sclerotic metastases return little signal since they contain little water.
If there is a diffuse abnormality of the bone marrow it can be difficult to identify but normal bone marrow should not be lower in signal intensity than the muscle on T1 weighted sequences.",TRUE,"The most likely appearance of the bone marrow after radiotherapy is very high on T1, isointense on T2.

She is brought round to the radiology department for an attempt at reduction by fluoroscopically guided air enema. Your assistant suggests you remove the grid before beginning the procedure. Which of the following regarding grids is correct? Select ONE answer only.,SBA: Paediatrics,Use of a grid increases the dose to the patient,Grids are not necessary for paediatric patients,Grids help reduce the effect of patient motion,Use of a grid increases dose to the operator,Without the grid there is no need to wear lead aprons,A,77%,15%,3%,3%,1%,"Explanation:
Grids
An anti-scatter grid is useful for patients heavier than around 20kg (about age 4-5) when scatter from within the patient reduces the image quality but, especially for patients smaller than this, the grid only serves to increase the patient dose (by only allowing direct photons through, a greater number of photons must be supplied to create the resultant image). Without any numbers or calculations to perform it is difficult to compare the effects of grid removal and field of view however in this patient the grid should definitely not be used as the patient is too small.
  Magnification and FOV
Image magnification can be achieved either via geometric or electronic means. Geometric magnification reduces patient dose by moving the patient further away from the radiation source however the further the patient is from the source, the greater the blurring effect of any patient (or bowel, or respiratory) motion. Electronic magnification is also called changing the field of view (think of this like zooming) and increasing the FOV does reduce the dose, but at the expense of image sharpness. The dose saving can be significant owing to the inverse square law.
  Collimation
Collimating the x-ray beam involves using lead shielding to concentrate the x-ray beam onto the target area (think of this like cropping). It is important to avoid irradiating tissue which is not required for diagnosis but also reduces operator dose by reducing scatter from the irradiated patient. This may be challenging in a paediatric intussusception scan as it relies on the patient lying still within the target area.
  Continuous vs pulsed
Continuous fluoroscopy mode (as opposed to pulsed fluoroscopy) involves, as the name suggests, imaging continuously as opposed to taking an image at pulsed intervals which involves far less dose. Moving objects are also better imaged with pulsed mode as there can be significant blurring when using continuous fluoroscopy.",TRUE,"I chose answer 1 because the use of a grid increases the dose to the patient. Grids are used to reduce scatter radiation and improve contrast, but they also increase the dose to the patient by blocking some of the x-rays. This is especially important to consider when dealing with pediatric patients, who are more sensitive to radiation exposure.",1,"3.

14419,207854,An 84-year-old lady is admitted to the Emergency Department after developing shortness of breath. The doctor reviewing her is concerned she may have a pulmonary embolus.

Select ONE answer only.,SBA: Cardiothoracic and vascular,V/Q scan,CTPA,Angiography,Perfusion only scan,Non-contrast CT chest,A,67%,13%,1%,17%,2%,"Explanation:
VQ (ventilation perfusion) scan
VQ scans are useful to risk stratify the diagnosis of pulmonary emboli in patients who have a contrast allergy or are at increased risk of contrast induced nephropathy. The chest x-ray must be normal however, to consider a VQ scan.
In pregnancy or lactation, VQ scanning also confers a far lower breast dose to the mother but the dose to the foetus, particularly when small, can be greater owing to tracer accumulation within the solid organs of the mother. The mother should be encouraged to adequately hydrate and void frequently in the subsequent hours/days following a scan.
Many institutes choose to perform perfusion scanning only in pregnant women on the understanding that if the perfusion scan is normal then there is no need to go on to perform the ventilation study. The perfusion scan can also be performed at half the usual dose to further reduce the foetal dose. Naturally doing so comes with the trade-off of lower sensitivity and specificity.",TRUE,"V/Q scan is the best option for managing this patient as it is a non-invasive imaging technique that can detect pulmonary embolism. It involves the injection of a radioactive tracer that is taken up by the lungs and can detect any blockages or areas of decreased blood flow. V/Q scans are also less expensive than other imaging techniques, making them a more cost-effective option for this patient. Additionally, given the patient's age and renal function, the risks associated with CTPA and angiography would be too high.",2,"3.

What is the most likely explanation?,SBA: Gastrointestinal,Pneumatosis cystoides intestinalis,Pneumatosis coli,Caecal volvulus,Sigmoid volvulus,Swyer-James syndrome,A,58%,37%,1%,1%,4%,"Explanation:
Pneumatosis cystoides intestinalis
There are a variety of terms used in a variety of contexts in the literature, often with overlap in intended usage. The term pneumatosis cystoides intestinalis is used to describe the presence of multiple gas-filled cysts within the wall of the 'intestines' (either small bowel or large bowel or both. To specify solely colonic involvement the correct term is Pneumatosis Cystoides Coli). It is a form of pneumatosis coli but whereas the latter has more sinister connotations, usually ischaemia, patients with pneumatosis cystoides intestinalis may be completely asymptomatic. In around 15% of patients no cause is identified (i.e. idiopathic) but it is also thought to be akin to gastric emphysema arising in patients with long-term respiratory conditions causing excessive coughing. 
    Differential diagnosis for intramural gas
  Ch = Chronic respiratory condition
I = Ischaemia
P = Post-traumatic
S = Scleroderma or steroids
  Swyer-James syndrome
In this condition, normal development of the infant lung is impeded by bronchiolitis (viral or mycoplasma) at an early age, with superadded acute airspace destruction. Consequently the affected lobe is small and lucent on the CXR due to air trapping. It is a differential diagnosis for a unilateral lucent hemithorax, along with a pneumothorax, very large pulmonary emboli and causes of decreased chest wall musculature such as Poland syndrome or, historically, polio. In an an exam situation Swyer-James syndrome is usually given as a teenage or young adult patient with a history of recurrent LRTIs. Air trapping, and bronchiectasis can also be described.
  Volvulus
In various areas of the abdomen it is possible for parts of the bowel to twist on themselves causing compromise to their own vascular supply and leading to a closed loop obstruction. This is termed a volvulus. The two most common locations are at redundant loops of sigmoid colon and the caecum but the transverse colon can also volve, as can the entire small bowel and the stomach. The following signs are mainly described with respect to sigmoid volvulus but there is some cross-over to the other types too.
Coffee-bean sign: two opposing dilated loops with a distinct midline crease
Three-line sign: the two outer walls of the loops and the central line
Bird-of-prey sign: on a barium enema, the beak-like outline of the most superior extent that the barium reaches before the volvulus
Whirl sign: on CT, the twisted mesenteric vessels at the centre of the torsion
Sigmoid volvulus is often associated wtih elderly patients who have chronic constipation but patients with any age can develop sigmoid redundancy thereby making them prone to a sigmoid volvulus. Pregnancy and institutionalisation are also risk factors.
In cases of caecal volvulus the haustral markings are preserved even when there is significant dilatation however in the sigmoid colon the haustra can flatten out under endo-tension. This is a specific sign for a sigmoid volvulus.
Chiliaditi sign is seen on a chest x-ray where the transverse colon rises up to sit under the right hemidiaphragm, between it and the liver. It is a mimic for subdiaphragmatic gas.

Mitral regurgitation
Chronic regurgitation causes left atrial enlargement with splaying of the carina and a double right heart border. It is also the only valvular pathology associated with isolated right upper lobe pulmonary oedema.
  Aortic stenosis
This can be congenital or acquired. Dilation of ascending aorta is seen due to a jet from the stenosis. Concentric left ventricular hypertrophy is occasionally a feature.
  Aortic regurgitation
This is usually secondary to bacterial endocarditis, Marfan’s, bicuspid aortic valve or aortic root dilatation (due to hypertension).
  Mitral stenosis
The most common cause of mitral stenosis is rheumatic heart disease. It can cause left atrial dilatation, but is not associated with right upper lobe pulmonary oedema.

On the x-ray there is calcification in the right iliac fossa. She undergoes an MRI and the calcification relates to an ovarian lesion which returns high signal on both T1 and T2 with areas of low T2 signal seen at the peripheries. What is the most likely diagnosis?,"SBA: Genito urinary, Adrenal, Obstetrics & Gynaecology and Breast",Dermoid,Mucinous adenocarcinoma of the ovary,Ectopic pregnancy,Germ cell tumour,Kruckenberg tumour,A,86%,8%,1%,5%,1%,"Explanation:
Mature teratoma
Teratomas and dermoid cysts have very similar imaging characteristics despite their histological differences. Teratomas are the most common ovarian neoplasm but are slow growing and usually benign. By contrast immature teratomas are malignant. The presence of fat is a strong indicator for a mature teratoma with the combination of fat, fluid and calcification being highly specific. On MRI the fat will show the usual signal drop-out on gradient echo sequences. Calcification will show as low signal on T2. Although benign, mature teratomas can be complicated by torsion or rupture. Malignant degeneration if it does occur, is to squamous cell carcinoma most commonly.
  Mucinous adenocarcinoma of the ovary
Although these are typically multilocular on imaging the diagnosis can often only be suggested, with confirmation coming from histological specimens. The imaging characteristics can vary depending on the mucein content of the tumour. Thick mucein returns high signal on T1 and can appear denser than soft tissue on CT. Mucinous adenocarcinomas of the ovary can be ginormous when they present.
  Ectopic pregnancy 
Vaginal bleeding is very common in early pregnancy but vaginal bleeding with pain or pain without vaginal bleeding definitely call for an ectopic pregnancy to be excluded. Factors which increase the risk of ectopic pregnancy include:
Previous ectopic 
IVF conception
Previous surgery to the Fallopian tubes
PID
  Since most present around 7-8 weeks gestation it is usual that the woman will not yet have had the first routine ultrasound scan, or in many cases, may not yet be aware of the pregnancy at all. Serial serum beta HCGs usually fail to double in the usual 48hours for ectopic pregnancies. The exact level of beta HCG helps guide the sonographer as to what they can expect to find. An ectopic pregnancy is most commonly located within one or other Fallopian tube. Ultrasound will fail to show an intrauterine pregnancy and the ectopic pregnancy can often be seen as a cystic mass elsewhere. The classic ‘ring of fire’ sign refers to the peripheral colour Doppler flow seen on an ectopic pregnancy although this can also be seen on a normal corpus luteal cyst.
  Germ Cell tumour
Ovarian germ cell tumours include teratomas, yolk sac tumours, choriocarcinomas and mixed germ cell tumours. Ovarian embryonal carcinoma and dysgerminomas are also germ cell tumours although they are far less common. Germ cell tumours make up approximately a quarter of all ovarian tumours and tend to affect young adults or children although can occur at any age. Besides pregnancy and gestational trophoblastic disease, beta HCG can also be raised ovarian embryonal carcinoma and dysgerminoma. Embryonal carcinoma can also cause elevation of AFP levels although this would be more classically associated with a Leydig-Sertoli tumour. Embryonal carcinoma can cause menstrual irregularity and any torting ovarian tumour can lead to the acute presentation described. Thick septa as a finding in ovarian masses is strongly linked to malignancy of any nature.
  Krukenberg tumours 
A Kruckenberg tumour is a metastatic deposit from stomach cancer which causes ovarian masses. These are often bilateral and can be mistaken for primary malignancies. The histology is of a mucin producing 'signet-ring' cell cancer of which most derive from the stomach but colorectal, breast, lung, and pancreatic versions can also cause Kruckenberg tumours. On all modalities the tumours have a complex part-cystic, part-solid appearance. ",FALSE,"Mucinous adenocarcinoma of the ovary is the most likely diagnosis based on the imaging findings. The presence of calcification in the right iliac fossa, high signal on T1 and T2 with areas of low T2 signal seen at the peripheries are highly suggestive of this diagnosis. Other possible diagnoses such as ectopic pregnancy, dermoid, germ cell tumour, and Kruckenberg tumour are less likely based on these findings.",2,,B,TRUE,,A,FALSE,D
11651,207854,A 14 -year-old girl confides in her mother that her periods have stopped. She denies being pregnant. Her GP requests an ultrasound and this shows an ovarian lesion. Blood tests done concurrently show an elevated AFP but the βHCG is normal. What is the most likely diagnosis?,SBA: Paediatrics,Leydig-Sertoli tumour,Yolk sac tumour,Granulosa cell tumour,Teratoma,Corpus luteal cyst,A,34%,36%,14%,15%,1%,"Explanation:
The top two answers for this question are a Leydig-Sertoli tumour and a Yolk sac tumour however only the former produces oestrogen and progesterone which would cause the amenorrhoea described in the vignette. Furthermore, although there is overlap, Leydig-Sertoli tumours tend to affect a slightly younger population than Yolk sac tumours. Yolk sac tumours are typically very aggressive, and usually very large at presentation. Presentation with a Yolk sac tumour is usually with a pelvic mass and associated symptoms.
  Leydig-Sertoli tumour
Most patients with a Leydig-Sertoli tumour are in their early teens. Normal Leydig and Sertoli cells are found in the testes and produce testosterone and oestrogen respectively, among other hormones. Leydig-Sertoli tumours often produce one or both hormones in excess leading to virilisation and amenorrhoea, although some patients may experience no hormonal manifestations. AFP is often elevated. They are solid, fibrous tumours which can show cystic elements where haemorrhage or necrosis has taken place. Owing to their fibrous nature they usually return low signal on MRI, with/without high signal foci related to the cystic areas.
  Granulosa cell tumours
These oestrogen producing tumours can affect women of any age. The excess oestrogen causes irregular or post menopausal bleeding. They tend to be large and multicystic with thick septations and a sponge-like appearance. Importantly they can be differentiated from epithelial ovarian tumours (e.g. Mucinous cystanedomas) by their lack of a feature described as intracystic papillary projections.
  Corpus luteal cyst
The corpus luteum comprises the remnant of an ovarian follicle post ovulation. Without fertilisation the normal corpus luteum will involute spontaneously within 2 weeks but occasionally they can persist even in the absence of fertilisation and be seen as a corpus luteum cyst. Ultrasound characteristics depend slightly on the age of the cyst and the presence or absence of haemorrhage within it but a small (<3 cm) thick walled, rounded, cystic structure with peripheral vascularity (the so-called ‘ring of fire’) would be classical. A repeat ultrasound scan after 6 weeks (to ensure a different part of the menstrual cycle) is usually recommended.
  Yolk sac tumour
These unpleasant germ cell tumours affect adolescents and can be quite large at presentation. A raised serum AFP is common. They are usually solid with or without cystic areas. Since they can arise from an ovarian dermoid sometimes fat signal can also be seen in association with these tumours.
  Mature teratoma
Teratomas and dermoid cysts have very similar imaging characteristics despite their histological differences. Teratomas are the most common ovarian neoplasm but are slow growing and usually benign. By contrast immature teratomas are malignant. The presence of fat is a strong indicator for a mature teratoma with the combination of fat, fluid and calcification being highly specific. On MRI the fat will show the usual signal drop-out on gradient echo sequences. Calcification will show as low signal on T2. Although benign, mature teratomas can be complicated by torsion or rupture. Malignant degeneration if it does occur, is to squamous cell carcinoma most commonly.",FALSE,"Granulosa cell tumours are the most likely diagnosis in this case due to the elevated AFP and normal βHCG. Elevated AFP can be indicative of a granulosa cell tumour, which is a type of ovarian tumour that can cause amenorrhea (absence of periods) in adolescents. The ultrasound would be able to confirm the presence of a lesion in the ovary, and the normal βHCG indicates that the girl is not pregnant.",2,,C,FALSE,,B,TRUE,A
13988,207854,A 56-year-old woman presents with back discomfort with pain and weakness in her legs. She undergoes an MRI of her lumbar spine for further assessment. The L3/4 disc is seen to extrude paracentrally and compress a nerve root. Which nerve root is most likely to be affected? Select ONE answer only.,SBA: Musculoskeletal and Trauma,L3,L4,L2,L1,T1,B,29%,70%,1%,1%,0%,"Explanation:
In the cervical spine the nerve roots exit at the spinal cord without needing to traverse (as in the lumbar spine). The exiting nerve root takes the name of the vertebra BELOW the affected disc. A disc protrusion at C3/4 will affect the C4 nerve root. This allows for the extra nerve root at C8 before reaching the thoracic spine. In the thoracic spine the affected level takes its name from the vertebral body ABOVE that level.
In the lumbar spine the exiting nerve root is usually compressed in the neural foramen, whereas the traversing nerve root is compressed usually in the lateral recess. Far lateral bulges affect the exiting nerve root (takes its name from the vertebral body ABOVE that level). Paracentral bulges affect the traversing nerve root (takes its name from the vertebral body BELOW that level).

 ",TRUE,"L4 is the nerve root most likely to be affected because it is the nerve root that is compressed by the extruded disc at the L3/4 level.

Most (95%) secrete catecholamines such as VMA (vanillylmandelic acid – leads to hypertension) or VIP (vasoactive intestinal polypeptides – leads to watery diarrhoea).

Opsomyoclonus Rapid jerky eye movements and myoclonic jerks of the legs. This occurs in around 2% of neuroblastoma cases but around 50% of patients with opsomyoclonus have a neuroblastoma.
Hutchinson syndrome Limping due to bony metastases
  On imaging, neuroblastomas appear as a very large abdominal mass with or without speckled calcification within in. The kidney can either be invaded or just displaced inferiorly, causing a ‘drooping lily’ appearance on urography (where contrast within the inferiorly displaced renal calyces has the appearance of a lily flower with its head hanging down). Neuroblastomas tend to encase large vessels such as the IVC, as opposed to displacing them as Wilms tumours are prone to doing.

What is the diagnosis?,SBA: Central Nervous and Head & Neck,Arachnoiditis,Disc sequestration,Post-op fibrosis,CSF leak,Normal finding,A,84%,2%,10%,2%,2%,"Explanation:
Arachnoiditis
The giveaway feature here is ‘clumping of the nerve roots’. At other times this may be describes as ‘empty thecal sac sign’ where the nerve roots are so adherent to the posterior aspect of the space that they become next to invisible. Arachnoiditis can occur secondary to surgery, meningitis, subarachnoid haemorrhage, myelography and can also be idiopathic in origin.
  Disc sequestration
This is the term used to describe the finding when a part of the disc material has completely separated itself from its parent disc and is seen free within the canal.
  Post-op fibrosis
MRI scans are often performed to look for post-op fibrosis or scar tissue and to differentiate it from recurrent disc pathology. The important imaging feature in such cases is enhancement Scar tissue will show enhancement with contrast whereas disc material will not.

Select ONE answer only.",SBA: Paediatrics,Spleen,Liver position,Malrotation,Cardiac anomalies,IVC anomalies,A,87%,5%,1%,3%,4%,"Explanation:
Heterotaxy
There are two main forms of this congenital disorder:
Left sided isomerism (polysplenia)
Things that would usually be found on the left side are duplicated on the right side too. The most consistent features are the abnormalities of the spleen and IVC. The other features are commonly associated, but variably seen. The prognosis is slightly better than for asplenia syndrome as there is a lower association with congenital heart disease. There is still 75% mortality by age 5 though.
Spleen - multiple little spleens
IVC - interrupted IVC with azygos or hemiazygos continuation
Lung lobes - two on either side
Liver - situated centrally in the abdomen
Bowel - malrotation
Pancreas - truncated
Heart - ASD, VSD, PAPVR (less severe congenital heart disease)
  Right sided isomerism (asplenia)
Things that would normally be found on the right side are duplicated on the left side too. Strong association with severe congenital heart disease means the condition has a mortality rate of 80% by age 1. Beyond that, the most consistent feature is the absence of the spleen. Once again, the other features are commonly associated, but variably demonstrated.
Heart - TAPVR and other anomalies (Almost 100% have severe cyanotic congenital heart disease)
Spleen - absent
Lung lobes - three on either side (specific finding)
Liver - normal position (can be midline or malpositioned)
Bowel - malrotation
IVC - on same side as aorta (usually the right)
Kidneys - associated with horseshoe kidney
 ",FALSE,"Cardiac anomalies can help distinguish between left and right sided isomerism because the heart is the most commonly affected organ in heterotaxy.

The term is used particularly in head and neck radiology where histological diagnosis of such entities is key. Some masses on a CT scan can have a 'typical' appearance for a lymphoma but are actually only benign lymphoid hyperplastic tissue and thus the term lymphoproliferative disorder covers both entities accurately.
IgG4 related diseases are one of Radiology’s newest entities. They comprise a constellation of fibrotic conditions affecting virtually every part of the body, mediated by a subclass of Immunoglobulin called IgG4. Where one condition exists others may also be present. The more common of these include:
Orbital pseudotumour
Fibrosing mediastinitis
Reidel thyroiditis
Autoimmune pancreatitis
Sclerosing mesenteritis
Retroperitoneal fibrosis",FALSE,"I chose this option because optic nerve meningiomas are the most common type of tumor found in this location. They are usually benign, slow-growing tumors that can cause vision loss and other neurological symptoms. They can be treated with surgery, radiation therapy, or medications.",2,,C,FALSE,,C,TRUE,A
14549,207854,A 45-year-old man with back pain is seen by an orthopaedic surgeon who requests x-rays. The x-rays show a number of findings which lead you to suspect he has ochronosis. Which of the following is NOT a feature of ochronosis? Select ONE answer only.,SBA: Musculoskeletal and Trauma,Hook like osteophytes,Renal failure,Osteoarthritis to hands,Chondrocalcinosis,Disc calcification,A,65%,10%,14%,5%,7%,"Explanation:
Please note that the question asks which answer is NOT a feature.
  Alkaptonuria (also known as ochronosis)
This condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. It is caused by excessive circulating levels of homogentisic acid (HGA) when the enzyme which would usually degrade it is deficient. HGA has an affinity for collagen and accumulates in the connective tissues throughout the body. In visible light HGA has a blackish colour and thus the disease can be diagnosed in infancy when a baby’s nappies are stained black by the presence of HGA in the urine. By the time patients reach their 20s pigmentation may be visible in their skin, particularly the ears. This is initially a dark yellow colour (hence the term ochronosis, from ‘Ochre’ in Greek meaning a dark yellow colour) but can progress to blue-grey and black.
In imaging chondrocalcinosis is the most prominent feature, with calcification and destruction of the intervertebral discs. Premature osteoarthritic changes to the hands, feet, shoulders, hips and knees will also develop as the collagen deteriorates. Deposition in the heart and kidneys too leads to cardiac and renal failure.",FALSE,"Renal failure is not a feature of ochronosis. Ochronosis is a metabolic disorder that is caused by an abnormality in the metabolism of the amino acid, homogentisic acid. It is characterized by the deposition of homogentisic acid in the connective tissues of the body, leading to the formation of ochronotic pigment, which is a yellowish-brown pigment. The clinical features of ochronosis include joint pain, stiffness, and deformities, as well as discoloration of the skin, eyes, and teeth. Hook-like osteophytes, osteoarthritis to hands, and disc calcification are all features of ochronosis.",1,"3. A question about clinical management, what is the best course of action?

Benign intracranial hypertension - (idiopathic intracranial hypertension)
This condition can easily be overlooked but causes significant morbidity for patients if undiagnosed. Increased intracranial pressure of the CSF on the surrounding brain causes:
Flattening of the posterior aspect of the globe
Tortuosity of the optic nerves
Empty sella syndrome (or partially so)
Small, 'Pinched' lateral ventricles (slit-like appearance is a relatively rare, poor sign to rely on).
  Sagittal sinus thrombosis
In sagittal sinus thrombosis the development of cerebral oedema secondary to infarction can compress the lateral ventricles, a finding in approximately a third of cases.
In contrast to this, prominent temporal horns, suggestive of developing hydrocephalus can be seen in sagittal sinus thrombosis due to decreased CSF absorption.
Ventricular bleeds might be seen in sagittal sinus thrombosis in the neonatal age group.
Bilateral haemorrhages in the context of sagittal sinus thrombosis are caused by venous infarction.
Papilloedema can be seen with both sagittal sinus thrombosis and idiopathic intracranial hypertension but is not an imaging feature.",FALSE,"Bilateral haemorrhages in sagittal sinus thrombosis occur as a result of arterial infarction. This is because when the sinus is thrombosed, the venous drainage from the brain is blocked, leading to increased pressure in the venous system and rupture of the arterial walls. This can lead to haemorrhages in the brain, which can be seen on imaging.",1,"This question falls under category 1: Basic factual recall, either of basic science, physics, anatomy or regarding a procedure.",A,TRUE,,A,FALSE,E

There are two facets to the question; the first is in knowing that a homonymous hemianopia suggests a problem in the contralateral optic tract and the second is in knowing the arterial supply to the optic tracts.
A left branch retinal artery occlusion would give a left sided hemianopia or quadrantanopia.
A left PCA infarction might cause a right homonymous hemianopia.
Meningiomas are usually slow growing and incidentally discovered. This would be a very unusual presentation of a meningioma.",FALSE,"The most likely cause for a left homonymous hemianopia is a left posterior cerebral artery (PCA) territory infarction. This is because the left PCA territory is responsible for supplying the left occipital lobe, which is the area of the brain responsible for vision on the left side of the visual field.

This question has asked a double negative. ‘Not an atypical feature’. Aspergillomas, pneumothoraces, normal central bronchi and empyemas would all be atypical for ABPA.
Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) is part of the spectrum of lung diseases caused by the fungus Aspergillus. How the fungus affects the patient depends on their underlying immune status.
Severely immunocompromised patients                        → Invasive aspergillosis
Mildly immunocompromised patients                            → semi-invasive aspergillosis
Normal patients                                                                   → non-invasive aspergillosis (such as colonization of a pre-existing cyst or cavity)
Hypersensitive patients (Cystic fibrosis or asthmatics) → Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis
ABPA causes a ‘migratory pneumonitis’, typically affecting the upper lobes. Parenchymal changes are fleeting; appearing in one area of the lung one week and a different area the next. The ‘finger in glove’ sign can often be seen, where mucus plugging of a bronchus allows the distal airway to fill with secretions giving rise to a ‘V’ or Y’ shaped shadow on a CXR or CT. Central bronchiectasis is a prominent feature and maybe indicated by the phrase ‘ring shadows’ in a description. The peripheral bronchi are classically spared. Cavity formation is seen in the later stages of the disease although aspergillomas are not typical (these occur in patients with a normal immune system). The typical patient will be young, with a history of either asthma or cystic fibrosis or ‘chronic lung disease’, symptoms of malaise, headache and intermittent chest pains, and an eosinophilia on their full blood count.",FALSE,"I chose 3 because a normal central bronchi is not an atypical feature of allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis. Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis is a type of hypersensitivity reaction to the fungus Aspergillus, which can cause inflammation and obstruction of the airways, as well as the formation of a fungus ball (aspergilloma) in the airways and/or cavities in the lungs. Pneumothorax, empyema, and cavities are all atypical features of allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis.",1,"3.

14115,207854,A 45-year-old man presents for an ultrasound scan with a left testicular lump. The ultrasound scan demonstrates hypoechoic masses in the left and right testicles. What is the most likely diagnosis? Select ONE answer only.,"SBA: Genito urinary, Adrenal, Obstetrics & Gynaecology and Breast",Lymphoma,Teratoma,Yolk sac tumour,Embryonal cell tumour,Choriocarcinoma,A,88%,2%,2%,6%,3%,"Explanation:
Lymphoma and leukaemia
Testicular lymphoma is uncommon but important. In men over the age of 60 it is the most common testicular malignancy and in men of any age it is the most common bilateral testicular malignancy (although it is not always bilateral). On ultrasound it appears either as a diffusely hypoechoic and enlarged testicle or as multiple hypoechoic masses.
Testicular leukaemia has very similar appearances to lymphoma and may be difficult to differentiate from it.
Teratomas, yolk sac tumours, embryonal cell tumours and choriocarcinomas all fall into the category of non-seminomatous germ cell tumours. Of these, embryonal cell tumours make up the vast majority.
Teratoma
This is the second most common tumour in boys under 5. aFP is usually normal. Under ultrasound it appears as a heterogenous complex mass.
Yolk sac tumour
This makes up 80% of childhood testicular tumours. They can often present as testicular enlargement without a focal mass. These metastasize to the lung which is the most common site of recurrent disease.
Embryonal cell tumour
This is the second most common testicular tumour. It is the most aggressive of all testicular tumours with visceral metastases common and a 5 year survival of 30%.
Choriocarcinoma
This is a rare tumour affecting 20-30-year-olds with rapid metastases to lung, liver, GI tract, brain. They often causes haemorrhage in both primary and metastatic lesions. They cause gynaecomastia in 10% of patients due to raised serum hCG.
In reality, tumours are often mixed histological types in around 35% cases. Testicular tumours can also be diagnosed with a strong pre-test probability based solely on age as detailed in the table below. The role of the radiologist however does not need to be as complex as suggesting the final histological diagnosis. Establishing the presence of a testicular mass is sufficient. Patients should then be referred on to the urology MDT. On ultrasound there will be an intratesticular low reflectivity well-defined mass. Colour doppler flow can be seen within the mass.

10381,207854,"An incidental finding on a trauma CT of the chest is a mass lesion in the left upper lobe of the lung, containing both calcification and fat density.

With the presence of fat density the diagnosis of hamartoma can be made and consequently no follow up is required.
Fat within a thoracic mass is diagnostic of a hamartoma but is only seen in approximately half of cases. In contradistinction to carcinoid tumours, hamartomas tend to be peripherally located whereas carcinoid tumours are often more central. Exceptions to both are reasonably frequent however. Calcification, especially popcorn calcification, is also very classical for hamartomas if present. Cavitation is not a feature often associated with them, but it can be found occasionally. Hamartomas form part of Carney triad (pulmonary chondromas, gastric leiomyosarcomas and extra-adrenal paragangliomas). NB this is different from Carney complex (atrial myxoma, facial/buccal pigmentation, sertoli tumours of the testis and multiple other findings).

9361,207854,You are performing a barium swallow on a 65-year-old man with progressive dysphagia. The barium swallow shows a stricture in the distal oesophagus with shouldering of the barium proximally. What is the most likely aetiology of this stricture?,SBA: Gastrointestinal,Squamous cell carcinoma,Achalasia,Barrett oesophagus,Leiomyoma,Aberrant right subclavian artery,A,75%,6%,16%,2%,1%,"Explanation:
Oesophageal carcinoma
Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the oesophagus predominantly affects the middle and lower thirds of the oesophagus and accounts for around 60% of oesophageal malignancies. Adenocarcinoma arises in the lower third, mostly in areas of Barrett oesophagus, and accounts for most of the remaining 40%. Some patients develop symptoms of dysphagia and retrosternal pain but sadly many tumours remain occult until they are at an advanced stage. This is in-part due to the fact that there is no serosal layer protecting the oesophagus and as such cancers can progress rapidly. Patients found to have Barrett oesophagus (metaplasia of the usual squamous epithelium to columnar epithelium) are screened frequently for adenocarcinoma. Importantly in the staging criteria, the only nodes which contribute to nodal staging are the immediately local ones to the cancer. Any involved lymph nodes of the cervical chains or coeliac region are considered as metastatic disease. It is therefore important to review these areas on a staging scan with particular attention.
  Achalasia
This is a motility disorder which causes a failure of relaxation of the gastro-oesophageal junction (GOJ) and disorganisation of oesophageal peristalsis. Ingested material (including barium during fluoroscopy) is held up at the GOJ in a column. On a barium study the column has a classical bird-beak tapering point at the inferior-most end where it reaches the GOJ. There is often then sudden emptying of the oesophagus due to eventual pressure on the GOJ exceeding its strength. Oesophageal contractions may be absent or may be non-peristaltic. On a CXR an air-fluid level may be seen behind the heart.
  Oesophageal leiomyoma
Leiomyomas are said to be the only oesophageal lesions which can calcify. Generally, the absence of any shouldering of a stricture is a benign feature. Leiomyomas tend to arise in relatively young patients and are more common in the mid or distal thirds of the oesophagus. Ulceration is a very uncommon feature.
  Aberrant right subclavian artery
This common anomaly occurs when instead of being the first major branch of the aorta (technically the first branches are the coronary arteries), the right subclavian artery arises distal to the left subclavian artery. It then has to swerve back around to reach the right side and in doing so usually runs posterior to the oesophagus, which can be seen on a barium study as a smooth indentation. In some cases it can exert sufficient pressure on the oesophagus to cause dysphagia which is termed dysphagia lusoria.
An aberrant left pulmonary artery is the ‘only’ vascular anomaly to run between the oesophagus and the trachea. There are cases of aberrancy of the right pulmonary artery in the literature however these patients tend to die in infancy.
An anterior indentation of the oesophagus is caused by:
An aberrant left pulmonary artery
A posterior indentation of the oesophagus is caused by:
A right sided arch with an aberrant left subclavian artery
A left sided arch with an aberrant right sided subclavian artery
A double aortic arch – this is usually described as also causing an anterior indentation to the trachea",TRUE,"The most likely aetiology of this stricture is squamous cell carcinoma, as it is the most common cause of oesophageal strictures in adults. Other possible causes of oesophageal strictures, such as achalasia, Barrett's oesophagus, leiomyoma, and aberrant right subclavian artery, are much less common.",2,"3.

Her respiratory rate is 23 breaths per minute, her heart rate is 118 beats per minute, and her blood pressure is recorded as 90/50mmHg. She is admitted to the intensive care unit and undergoes an abdominal ultrasound scan. This demonstrates a distended gallbladder with a thick wall and an internal membrane. There are also several small stones. Although her blood pressure has improved since admission, her heart rate and respiratory rate remain high. What is the most appropriate management?",SBA: Gastrointestinal,ERCP in ITU,Laparoscopic cholecystectomy,Open exploration,IV Antibiotics,Percutaneous cholecystostomy,E,2%,8%,3%,20%,66%,"Explanation:
Usual management of straightforward acute calculous cholecystitis involves fluids, antibiotics and pain relief. A laparoscopic cholecystectomy should be performed within three days but in patients who are sufficiently unstable a percutaneous cholecystostomy should be performed.
  Gangrenous cholecystitis
Necrosis to the gallbladder wall can complicated around a quarter of cases of cholecystitis but is more usually seen in elderly patients, those with diabetes or those who may be immunocompromised. Once identified, these patients should undergo urgent decompression via cholecystostomy to allow the necrotic material to drain. Ultrasound features suggesting the presence of gangrenous cholecystitis include:
Asymmetrical wall thickening
Ulcerations of focal defects in the gall bladder wall
Sloughed mucosa lining appearing as an intraluminal membrane
Pericholecystic fluid collections
  Cholecystitis
When a gallstone becomes lodged in the neck of the gallbladder, chemical irritation from the trapped bile leads to inflammation of the gallbladder. Sometimes this can be felt by the patient as shoulder pain since irritation of the gallbladder is felt via C3, 4 and 5 the dermatomes of which cover the shoulder. Mostly, however, patients complain of right upper quadrant pain. With an accurate history this should be distinguishable from the pain caused by biliary colic, the latter being intermittent in nature and lasting less than six hours per episode.
On ultrasound the earliest signs will be of gallstones in the presence of a sonographic Murphy sign. Clinically Murphy sign is maximal tenderness when palpating over the gallbladder and the addition of ultrasound allows for greater specificity in this regard. The presence of pericholecystic fluid and increasing thickness of the gallbladder wall (>3mm) are also common findings, but come slightly later on. With CT similar findings can be seen with the addition of enhancement of the adjacent liver due to reactive hyperaemia. The presence of gallstones can be easily masked on CT since they are often of equal density to the bile.
Nuclear medicine tests would not usually be part of the index management of cholecystitis however can be used to determine cytic duct patency. Non-visualisation of the gallbladder at four hours following injection of 99mTc-HIDA is reported to be 99% specific in the diagnosis of cholecystitis. Acalculous cholecystitis can also occur, often in the setting of an already unwell patient on ITU. It will present as generic sepsis and it is usually down to the clinical team to retain a high index of suspicioun. It is thought to be a consequence of low blood flow in the cystic artery.
Emphysematous cholecystitis signifies a gas-producing organism such as Clostridium or E-coli. Appearances are striking on imaging with ring-down or reverberation artefacts on ultrasound and mural gas seen on CT. Patients are typically (but not exclusively) diabetic or suffering from a debilitating condition. Unfortunately the mortality rate is significantly higher than for non-emphysematous cholecystitis.
Mirizzi syndrome can present as cholecystitis and occurs when the common hepatic duct is obstructed by the mechanical pressure of a stone within the cystic duct. It follows that patients whose cystic duct happens to insert low in the course of the common hepatic duct are predisposed to this condition.",FALSE,"Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is the most appropriate management for this patient. This procedure is minimally invasive and can be performed with minimal risk to the patient. It is also the most effective way to remove the gallstones, which are causing the patient's symptoms.

Three plane T2 imaging is common practice and enables full assessment of the peripheral zone of the prostate, particularly examining for extra-capsular extension, bladder base or seminal vesical invasion. T2 is also the most important sequence for lesions in the transitional zone.
Diffusion weighted imaging is essential for PIRADS calculation and is the first sequence that should be used to evaluate lesions in the peripheral zone. Axial dynamic contrast enhanced imaging (after non-contrast axial T1) is then essential to differentiate between between PIRADS 3 and 4 lesions.
The T1 weighted sequences are also useful to check for the presence of any haemorrhagic foci although since most patients now undergo their MRI scan prior to any biopsies being taken this has become far less important.
Interestingly the ADC map is more sensitive for carcinoma of the prostate (in the peripheral zone) than the DWI sequences. A finding of focal low signal on the ADC map may be seen in the absence of a corresponding high DWI focus. In the transitional zone however, the T2 sequences are more sensitive.",TRUE,"This protocol is the most concise and would enable full staging of a malignant lesion.

These benign lesions can present with pain but around a third of cases are diagnosed incidentally. The classic location for them is the calcaneum but they do occur all around the body. On x-ray they appear as a lucent bone lesion with a thin cortex and no periosteal reaction. Some show dystrophic calcifications. On MRI signal characteristics follow fat with high signal on T1 and signal loss on fat suppression sequences. The presence of granulation tissue can give high signal and calcifications, if present, will return low signal. On CT the fat within the lesion will show low/negative Hounsfield units.

Patients are typically young (10-30 years) and the lesions are typically found in the hands (although they can form anywhere in the body. In the hands they are unusual to be found in the terminal phalanges). They are thought to derive from ongoing growth of small foci of cartilage which have become displaced from the growth plate. They can expand the cortex but, unless presenting as a fracture, should be painless and therefore are often an incidental diagnosis. Although they are benign tumours, malignant degeneration to a chondrosarcoma can occur.
  Unicameral bone cyst also known as simple bone cyst
These benign, asymptomatic lesions are almost always found in children in the metaphyseal region of long bones. They can, however, present with pain from a fracture, in which case the ‘fallen fragment’ sign is almost pathognomonic. This occurs when a small piece of the thin cortex overlying the lesion breaks off and is seen dependant within the cyst. Otherwise on x-ray they appear as a lucent bone lesion with a narrow zone of transition, no periosteal reaction and no soft tissue component. Since they are fluid-filled they return high signal on T2 weighted MRI sequences.
  Causes of bone infarction:
Sickle cell disease
Excess corticosteroid
Pancreatitis
Caisson disease ‘The Bends’
Gaucher disease
Leukemia/lymphoma
  Medullary osteonecrosis can be secondary to anything leading to vascular compromise and has the propensity to lead to severe loss or architecture and loss of function, not to mention pain, to the patient. It is an important diagnosis to make. On plain film the finding is usually of a lucent area with a sclerotic serpiginous border of granulation tissue. On MRI this serpiginous border returns low signal on T1 and a ‘double-line’ sign on T2 (high signal of granulation tissue surrounded by low signal of sclerosis). Strangely enough, centrally within the infarction the signal retains the characteristics of normal fatty marrow.",FALSE,"Unicameral bone cysts are well-defined radiolucent lesions that are typically seen in the calcaneus. They are typically filled with fluid, have a faint sclerotic margin, and often have some central calcification. The other options are not likely to be seen in the calcaneus and do not match the description of the lesion. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is a unicameral bone cyst.",2,,B,TRUE,,A,FALSE,D
11276,207854,A 29-year-old teacher presents to A+E with acute lower abdominal and pelvic pain. She is found to have a raised white cell count and other inflammatory markers are also elevated. She is admitted for further investigations and undergoes an MRI scan. This shows an intramural fibroid which returns low signal on T1 and high signal on T2 with a complex internal structure. What is the most likely diagnosis?,"SBA: Genito urinary, Adrenal, Obstetrics & Gynaecology and Breast",Cystic degeneration,Myxoid degeneration,Red degeneration,Hyaline degeneration,Malignant degeneration,B,39%,34%,13%,12%,2%,"Explanation:
Aside from the fact that myxoid degeneration is more common than cystic degeneration, two features set these two apart. Fibroids which have undergone myxoid degeneration but appear cystic tend to have a very complex 'cystic type' structure, as opposed to a simpler internal structure. Furthermore, if there are foci of very high T2 signal this suggests myxoid degeneration.
  Uterine fibroids also known as Leiomyomas
‘Leio’ means smooth in Latin and ‘myo’ means muscle. An ‘oma’ is a lump. Uterine fibroids therefore are smooth muscle lumps by literal translation. They are extremely common and can cause no problems at all however some women do experience significant problems attributable to their fibroids. Fibroids are usually described according to their location, namely subserosal, submucosal, intramural, pedunculated or cervical. On MRI they appear as low signal (compared to the myometrium) on T2 weighted sequences. They grow and shrink in response to the presence or absence of oestrogen. Thus they can get bigger during pregnancy and tend to involute during the course of the menopause.
Fibroids are complicated by degeneration which occurs when the mass outgrows its own blood supply. This takes place in one of four ways:
Hyaline degeneration – this is the most common form, accounting for over half of cases. Proteinaceous material collects in the extracellular space. Calcification (typically described as popcorn calcification) can occur and is sometimes visible on plain films. Appearances on MRI are similar to non-degenerate fibroids with low signal on T2.
Myxoid degeneration – These fibroids are easily confused with cystic degeneration owing to their high T2 signal. The focal areas of very high T2 signal are set against a backdrop of low T2 signal where the gelatinous material has not reached. Where they appear cystic, the complex nature of the cysts suggests myxoid degeneration over cystic degeneration.
Cystic degeneration – Although this type of degeneration is uncommon it gives classical MRI appearances of high T2 signal.
Red degeneration (aka carneous degeneration) – This entity is related to pregnancy or use of the oral contraceptive pill, but can occur without either. It is essentially haemorrhagic necrosis and can present acutely as abdominal pain. MRI characteristics vary depending on the degradation of blood within the fibroid. Peripheral high T2 signal is often described.
  Uterine fibroid embolisation contraindications:
Pelvic infection
History of pelvic radiation
Connective tissue disease
Asymptomatic fibroids
Pregnancy
Pedunculated fibroids
  In the world of interventional radiology, uterine fibroid embolisation is gaining momentum. The uterine artery arises from the internal iliac artery whereas the ovarian artery arises directly from the aorta and has a corkscrew appearance on angiography. Anastomoses between the two arteries or the two sides exist in approximately 20% of patients. Patients should be counselled for the risk of ovarian dysfunction subsequent to the procedure and patients over the age of 45 are at particular risk. Pedunculated fibroids are said to be poor candidates for embolisation owing to their propensity to detach however the literature is slightly contradictory on this topic.",FALSE,"Red degeneration is the most likely diagnosis in this case because it is characterized by a intramural fibroid that has a low signal on T1 and high signal on T2 with a complex internal structure. This type of degeneration is caused by a sudden increase in the blood supply to the fibroid, usually due to trauma or hormonal changes. It is the most common type of degeneration seen in fibroids.",2,,C,FALSE,,C,TRUE,A
14252,207854,Which SINGLE statement regarding the lesser curvature of the stomach is true?,SBA: Gastrointestinal,The angular notch is situated two-thirds of the way along it,It is longer than the greater curvature,The greater omentum arises from it,It is convex in shape,It forms the lateral border of the stomach,A,84%,1%,4%,10%,2%,"Explanation:
The stomach is a J-shaped digestive organ that lies in the superior aspect of the abdomen between the oesphagus and the duodenum.
It has four main regions:
The cardia – which is around the opening of the oesophagus
The fundus – which is the dilated superior portion lying beneath the left dome of the diaphragm
The body – which is the large central position lying between the fundus and the pylorus
The pylorus – which is the lower portion that facilitates the emptying of its contents into the duodenum
  The medial and lateral borders of the stomach are curved, forming the greater and lesser curvatures of the stomach:
The greater curvature – forms the longer, convex, lateral border of the stomach. The greater omentum arises from it.
The lesser curvature – forms the shorter, concave, medial border of the stomach. The lesser omentum arises from it.
  There is a sharp indentation two-thirds of the way along the lesser curvature called the angular notch. This point marks the junction of the body and the pylorus.
Food boluses enter the stomach via the lower oesophageal sphincter. Once within the stomach protein digesting enzymes, such as pepsin, are released. Hydrochloric acid within the stomach provides a suitably acidic pH for these enzymes to work and also serves to kills bacteria. The food boluses are churned up by peristaltic contractions of the wall and converted into chyme. The passage of chyme into the duodenum is controlled by the pyloric sphincter, which lies between the pylorus and the duodenum.
   ",FALSE,"I chose number 4 because it is the only statement that is true regarding the lesser curvature of the stomach. The lesser curvature of the stomach is convex in shape, while the greater curvature is concave. The lesser curvature is shorter than the greater curvature, the greater omentum does not arise from it, and the angular notch is not situated two-thirds of the way along it.",1,"1.

14316,207854,You are performing a scrotal ultrasound for a 60-year-old man who presented to his GP having noticed a swelling above his left testicle. You suspect he may have a tunica albuginea cyst. What are the most likely findings on ultrasound? Select ONE answer only.,"SBA: Genito urinary, Adrenal, Obstetrics & Gynaecology and Breast",Multiseptate cystic mass with thin echogenic line running over the top and around the rest of the testicle,Solid mass with thin echogenic line running over the top and around the rest of the testicle,Solid cystic mass with no internal echoes,Multiseptate cystic mass with no internal echoes,Multiseptate cystic mass with internal echoes,A,68%,6%,6%,16%,4%,"Explanation:
Spermatocoele
A spermatocoele is a focal dilatation of a duct within the head of the epididymis. Since they contain protein debris and spermatozoa, low level echoes can be seen floating within them differentiating them from epididymal cysts. They are essentially an incidental asymptotic finding. They can be unilocular or multiseptate, and measure a few millimetres or a few centimetres in diameter.
  Epididymal cyst
A cystic structure within the epididymis is most commonly a simple cyst. They can present as palpable masses or be found incidentally. On ultrasound they behave as you might expect from a cyst, with posterior acoustic enhancement of an anechoic round structure. The main differential diagnosis is a spermatocoele which, unlike a simple cyst, usually contains echogenic material. The latter is usually only found in the epididymal head.
  Tunica albuginea cyst
The tunica albuginea is a fibrous layer covering the testicle. On ultrasound it appears as the thin echogenic line surrounding the testicle. When cysts form here they are usually palpable as small well-defined lumps a few millimetres in diameter. Appearances on ultrasound usually conform to those expected from any straightforward cyst, i.e. a sharply defined anechoic structure with acoustic enhancement posteriorly. They can be uni or multilocular and although they can exert mass effect on the underlying testicle they do not affect the testicular tissue beyond this. They are most commonly located at the anterosuperior or superolateral aspect of the testicle.",TRUE,I chose number 3 because a tunica albuginea cyst is a multiseptate cystic mass with a thin echogenic line running over the top and around the rest of the testicle. This is the most likely finding on an ultrasound for this type of cyst.,1,"3. A question about problem solving, what should be done next?

This patient is demonstrating the psoas sign, a medical sign that indicates that there is irritation of the iliopsoas group of hip flexors in the abdomen.
The psoas sign can be elicited by passively extending the thigh of a patient lying on their side with the knees extended, or by asking the patient to actively flex the thigh at the hip. If this results in abdominal pain or the movements are resisted because of pain then there is a positive ‘psoas sign’.
The pain occurs because the psoas muscle borders the peritoneal cavity. Stretching or contraction of the muscles will therefore cause friction against the nearby inflamed tissues. It is strongly suggestive that the appendix is retrocaecal in position.",FALSE,"The most likely position of the appendix in this patient is ascending preileal. This is due to the fact that the patient has tenderness in the right iliac fossa, which is a common symptom of appendicitis. Additionally, the patient's abdominal pain worsens when her thigh is passively extended, which is another sign of appendicitis in the ascending preileal position.

A bony fragment at the dorsum of the wrist is likely to be either from the triquetrum or the hamate. Triquetrum is not provided as a potential choice in this question, so the correct answer has to be hamate. On a radiograph, hamate will lie more superiorly and is far less common than a triquetrum fracture. Of the carpal bones, the scaphoid is most frequently fractured, followed by the triquetrum.",FALSE,"The scaphoid is the most likely bone to be fractured in this scenario. This is because the scaphoid is located at the base of the thumb, which is the area where the patient fell on her outstretched hand.

  Infantile haemangioendothelioma
These are benign lesions of which the vast majority occur in babies under the age of 6 months. Serum AFP levels can be elevated in normal babies upto the age of 6 months and occasionally these lesions can cause an elevation in serum AFP, as such the presence of a raised AFP is not particularly specific. Around half of cases are associated with the presence of a cutaneous haemangioma. They are large vascular tumours and on imaging behave as might be expected of a haemangioma with low echogenicity on ultrasound, peripheral enhancement with gradual filling in on CT and flow voids on MRI. Calcifications can be seen with these lesions but they are finer, more granular calcifications; not coarse. Owing to their size they often cause significant right to left shunting of blood resulting in congestive heart failure. Thrombocytopaenia due to platelet trapping (known as the Kasabach-Merritt sequence). N.B. these lesions should not be confused with epithelioid haemangioendotheliomas which occur in adults.
  Hepatoblastoma
Most hepatoblastomas are found in children under the age of 3 but they can occur at any point in childhood. They are the third most common abdominal tumour in children. Presentation is typically with an abdominal mass and weight loss and the serum AFP is often markedly elevated. Some may produce hormones and thereby precocious puberty but this is rare. Coarse calcification is seen in around a third of cases. On ultrasound the mass will be large and heterogenous. On CT they appear as a predominantly low attenuation mass seeming to consist of multiple confluent nodules. Often the rim of the mass enhances well on CT. On MRI they are, for the most part, high in signal on T2 weighted sequences but can show low intensity fibrous bands running through them.
  Wilms tumour also known as a nephroblastoma
This is the most common abdominal mass in children under the age of 8. There are reasonably strong associations with renal anomalies, genital anomalies, aniridia and Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (although the last of these also has an association with neuroblastoma). Presentation is usually with an abdominal mass and/or pain.
10% tumour – Wilms
Calcification
Vascular invasion
Bilateral
Lung metastases
Poor histology
  On imaging the masses are usually heterogenous. Cystic areas can often be seen secondary to areas of necrosis. The claw sign occurs when there is a rim of normal renal tissue extending part of the way around the mass. A Wilms tumour is often described as enhancing but less so than the adjacent normal renal parenchyma.
  Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) also known as Hepatoma
There is a peak in the incidence of HCCs in the paediatric age range at around age 13. The central scar of an HCC is a specific feature which can help separate it from potential differential diagnoses. Although calcification of this central scar is seen in around a quarter of cases there tends to be less calcification in HCCs than there would be in a hepatoblastoma.
Although metastases are the most common cause of malignant hepatic lesions, hepatocellular carcinoma is the most common primary hepatic malignancy. It usually arises on a background of cirrhosis of any cause. Patients with any of the hepatitis viruses, alcoholic cirrhosis, haemochromatosis, and Wilson disease are all at risk. Carcinogens such as thorotrast and aflatoxin also predispose to HCC formation. Serum alpha fetoprotein levels are often raised, in contrast with cholangiocarcinomas which are one of the main differential diagnoses.
On imaging HCCs can have a variety of appearances. A large irregular mass with satellite nodules is the most common finding but a diffuse infiltrative version can also occur. Since HCCs derive their blood supply from the hepatic artery they show arterial enhancement on CT with washout on later phases. On ultrasound HCCs tend to be hyperechoic when compared to the rest of the liver and on MRI they show variable signal intensity on both T1 and T2 but arterial enhancement with venous washout can again be seen once Gadolinium has been given.
  Hepatic abscess
Liver abscesses can occur in children, for much the same reasons as they arise in adults, although they are far more common in adults. Pyogenic abscesses result from bacteria accessing the liver via the biliary tree, septicaemia, direct spread, trauma or during a liver procedure. Patients are usually in their 60s. Amoebic abscesses occur in slightly younger patients (40s) and tend to result from spread of amoebae from the colon via the portal venous system. On ultrasound they appear as a hypoechoic mass with posterior acoustic enhancement. Internal debris may be apparent. On CT they are usually low in attenuation with rim enhancement. MRI signal characteristics are dependent on the protein content of the pus but usually abscesses return little T1 signal and, owing to their fluid nature, return high signal on T2 weighted sequences. It is said that amoebic abscesses are usually found to be contiguous with the liver capsule.",FALSE,"I chose Hepatoblastoma as the most likely diagnosis because the x-ray, ultrasound, and CT scans all showed signs of a large mass located in the right lobe of the liver.

Given the patient has one functioning kidney, minimal ipsilateral hydronephrosis and a 5mm stone which should pass spontaneously, a further ultrasound is superfluous. Likewise stenting or a nephrostomy at this stage is not necessary.
In recent years patients with ureteric colic have been imaged with CT KUB which is a low-dose, non-contrast CT scan through the abdomen and pelvis. Urinary tract calculi can be detected on this with significant accuracy however if the patient's symptoms are not caused by renal tract calculi then the scan is a very poor substitute for a normal CT abdomen and pelvis with a far lower sensitivity and specificity for other abdominal pathologies. A negative scan can be falsely reassuring for the clinical teams caring for the patient.
CT KUB studies are also used to follow up patients with known urinary tract calculi following an acute admission however many stones are sufficiently dense as to be plainly visible on abdominal radiographs, and even on the scout views of the CT KUB performed at the time of presentation. As a rough guide, stones which have Hounsfield Units greater than 700 ought to be visible on an abdominal radiograph and this should be considered for follow up in place of a CT KUB.",FALSE,"A retrograde ureteric stent is the best treatment option for a patient with a left sided 5mm proximal ureteric calculus. This type of stent is inserted through the urethra and passed up the ureter to the calculus. It is used to help relieve the pressure caused by the blockage and to allow the stone to pass more easily. The stent also helps to reduce the risk of further damage to the ureter or kidney due to the blockage.

9106,207854,A baby born at full term to a diabetic mother is brought back to hospital 36 hours later. There were no immediate complications following birth but the parents are concerned that the baby has not yet passed his first stool and now has a very rounded abdomen. An abdominal radiograph shows the transverse colon to be full of meconium but with no gas in the descending colon or rectum. The baby undergoes a water soluble enema which causes passage of the meconium and the baby is eventually discharged in full health. What is the most likely diagnosis?,SBA: Paediatrics,Meconium plug,Meconium ileus,Necrotising enterocolitis,Hirschsprung disease,Meconium peritonitis,A,88%,10%,0%,2%,0%,"Explanation:
Of the neonatal causes of bowel obstruction, the age at presentation and level of obstruction can point heavily towards the diagnosis.
  Level of obstruction
Age at presentation
NEC
All/any
<10 days
Meconium ileus
Caecum/terminal ileum
<48hrs
Meconium plug
Splenic flexure
<48hrs
Hirschsprung disease
Sigmoid colon

  Meconium plug
Whereas meconium ileus leads to small bowl obstruction, meconium plug syndrome leads to large bowel obstruction due to functional immaturity of the colon. This will also present within the first two days of life with a failure to pass meconium. Some literature associates this condition with babies born to diabetic mothers and around a quater of patients have cystic fibrosis. The condition can be treated with a water-soluble contrast enema.
  Necrotising enterocolitis
This is the most common gastrointestinal emergency for premature babies. It results from an immature immune system being unable to cope with mucosal ulceration. Almost all cases occur before the baby reaches 10 days old. Pneumatosis intestinalis (intramural gas) is the hallmark of the condition on abdominal radiography and appears as curvilinear or bubbly areas. Branching gas within the liver, indicative of portal venous gas can also occur but is not as serious a finding as it would be for an adult. Surgery is definitely indicated however, if there is evidence of perforation and for this reason patients should undergo a horizontal beam x-ray. If performed decubitus the left side should be down in order to better visualise air against the contour of the liver. On an over-table view the ‘football’ sign, where a large collection of gas rises centrally, is seen if there is sufficient free gas within the abdomen.
  Meconium ileus
This condition is strongly associated with cystic fibrosis but not with prematurity. The thicker-than-normal intestinal mucus, increase in transit time and pancreatic insufficiency all conspire to cause impaction of meconium leading to small bowel obstruction in neonates. It should be suspected if the baby does not pass meconium within the first 2 days of life. On an abdominal radiograph there will be no air-fluid levels since no fluid is present but multiple gas filled dilated loops of small bowel will be seen. The meconium can sometimes be seen as a bubbly area in the right lower quadrant where it has impacted within the terminal ileum.
  Meconium peritonitis
When there is antenatal bowel perforation the result is a chemical peritonitis as opposed to a purulent one since the bowel is as yet unpopulated by the usual flora of life after birth. The result is calcification scattered around the abdomen. If the perforation spontaneously heals itself then the prognosis is excellent and the finding of abdominal calcification may be purely incidental.
  Hirschsprung disease
There is a congenital absence of parasympathetic ganglia in the muscular and submucosal layers of a segment of colon, usually the sigmoid colon. The affected segment is unable to relax to pass meconium and patients therefore present with failure to pass meconium or sometimes within the first six weeks of life with severe constipation with overflow diarrhoea. Classically on a barium enema there is an inverted cone shape formed between the normal and abnormal bowel segments and the diagnosis should be confirmed using a suction biopsy below this transition point. Another feature seen on a barium enema is a result of abnormally coordinated contractions of the affected segment which appears as so-called ‘persistent corrugation’.",TRUE,"Meconium plug is the most likely diagnosis because the baby had a full transverse colon full of meconium, with no gas in the descending colon or rectum. This indicates that the meconium was blocking the baby's intestines, preventing the passage of gas and leading to the rounded abdomen. The water soluble enema caused the passage of the meconium, which then relieved the blockage and allowed the baby to be discharged in full health.",2,,B,FALSE,,D,FALSE,D

The menisci of the knee are two pads of fibrocartilaginous tissue, which have two main functions:
They deepen the articular surface of the tibia and increase stability of the knee joint
To disperse friction between the femur and tibia, acting as ‘shock absorbers’
  Both menisci are C shaped and are attached at both ends to the intercondylar area of the tibia.
The medial meniscus is also fixed to the medial collateral ligament and the joint capsule. As a consequence of this injuries to the medial collateral ligament are often accompanied by a tear of the medial meniscus. The lateral meniscus is smaller and does not have any extra attachments, rendering it fairly mobile.

11776,207854,"A 3-month-old baby boy is brought in with progressive cyanosis and respiratory distress. His CXR shows a reduced number of lung markings in the periphery of a hyperinflated left upper lobe with flattening of the hemidiaphragms, and deviation of mediastinum to the right. What is the most likely diagnosis?",SBA: Paediatrics,Congenital lobar overinflation,Congenital pulmonary airway malformation,Tension pneumothorax,Swyer-James syndrome,Pulmonary interstitial emphysema,A,72%,5%,17%,3%,4%,"Explanation:
Congenital lobar overinflation (previously congenital lobar emphysema)
This condition is thought to be caused by underdevelopment of bronchial cartilage in the affected lobe(s). Consequently the bronchus is unable to remain patent during expiration leading to significant air trapping. It is usually the left upper lobe which is affected but approximately 40% of cases involve the left upper lobe; the right middle or the right upper lobes are affected in a further 55% of cases. There is a reasonable male preponderance of approximately 3:1.
On a CXR there is hyperlucency of the affected lobe and often mass effect on the mediastinum leading to contralateral mediastinal shift and thereby respiratory distress.
  Pulmonary interstitial emphysema (PIE)
As the name would suggest, this disease is diagnosed when there is air within the interstitial tissues of the lungs. It is caused by alveolar rupture due to the barotrauma of mechanical ventilation or positive airway pressure. It can be associated with hyaline membrane disease and is prevalent in infants of a low birth weight. Complications such as pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum can be severe and acutely life threatening. Radiographically there is hyperinflation and lucencies in either a cystic pattern or streaks emanating from the hila and following the direction of the bronchi/bronchioles. It is treated with high frequency oscillation ventilation which is less traumatic to the lungs.
  Swyer-James syndrome
In this condition, normal development of the infant lung is impeded by bronchiolitis (viral or mycoplasma) at an early age, with superadded acute airspace destruction. Consequently the affected lobe is small and lucent on the CXR due to air trapping. It is a differential diagnosis for a unilateral lucent hemithorax, along with a pneumothorax, very large pulmonary emboli and causes of decreased chest wall musculature such as Poland syndrome or, historically, polio. In an an exam situation Swyer-James syndrome is usually given as a teenage or young adult patient with a history of recurrent LRTIs. Air trapping, and bronchiectasis can also be described.
  Congenital Pulmonary Airway Malformation (CPAM) – also known as Congenital cystic adenomatoid malformation (CCAM)
Although often an antenatal diagnosis, CPAM should be considered in the investigation of a neonatal respiratory distress. Milder cases can present later when the child develops a LRTI and decompensates. On investigation a cystic mass is discovered. The size of the cysts denotes the type with Type I accounting for half of cases and comprising a smaller number of larger (>20mm) cysts. Type III is more sponge-like with cysts measuring only a couple of mm and Type II is between the two. Where cysts are larger, air-fluid levels may be seen. The malformation can exert a mass effect, causing both hypoplasia of the remainder of the ipsilateral lung as well as contralateral mediastinal shift.
  Tension pneumothorax
This must be ruled out for any patient presenting with acute respiratory distress. The presence of lung markings, even if scarce, ought to rule this out although the difference between ‘scarce’ and ‘absent’ is undoubtedly easier to interpret on a real CXR as opposed to a wooly description of one.",FALSE,"I chose this answer because the CXR findings are consistent with a diagnosis of Congenital Pulmonary Airway Malformation (CPAM).

Subarachnoid haemorrhage is actually reasonably rare in AVF although it can happen. A history of trauma would point towards the lesion being an AVF and is therefore a potentially viable answer for this question too however on balance the presence or absence of a nidus is more definitive.

14142,207854,A 31-year-old lady who is 25 weeks pregnant with her first pregnancy presents with shortness of breath and tachycardia. Full blood count and renal function tests are normal. The admitting team suspect she may have a pulmonary embolism. Which of the following is the best initial test? Select ONE answer only.,"SBA: Genito urinary, Adrenal, Obstetrics & Gynaecology and Breast",PA chest radiograph,AP chest radiograph,CT pulmonary angiogram,Ventilation/ perfusion scan,Ultrasound doppler of the legs,A,62%,4%,3%,4%,26%,"Explanation:
A pregnant patient suspected to have a pulmonary embolus should undergo a chest x-ray to look for alternative causes of shortness of breath such as a lower respiratory tract infection, pleural effusions or a pneumothorax. In the event that they go on to have a VQ scan a chest radiograph is required for comparison.
Thereafter the patient should undergo bilateral lower limb venous dopplers if they have signs or symptoms of deep vein thrombosis. Around a third of pregnant patients who develop pulmonary emboli will have a deep vein thrombosis and for these patients treatment can be started on the basis of their DVT diagnosis without the need for further imaging. If the patient has no signs or symptoms of a DVT, they should proceed to a VQ scan or a CTPA.
The patient should be counselled that there is a small increase in the absolute risk of the foetus developing a childhood cancer following a maternal VQ scan but also that the absolute risk of maternal breast cancer is reduced compared to a CTPA.
  CTPA
CTPA imaging confers a lower dose to the foetus than V/Q scanning, although this effect is diminished in the third trimester as the gravid uterus becomes closer to the field of view.
Unfortunately however, CTPA confers a far greater dose to the breast tissue of the mothers at a time when the tissue is more radiosensitive than it would otherwise be in a non-pregnant woman.
A secondary consideration is the use of iodinated contrast. Iodine crosses the placenta and is excreted by the foetal kidneys into the amniotic fluid. Babies of mothers who have received iodinated contrast during pregnancy should be tested during their first week of life for thyroid suppression although there is little evidence in literature to suggest that many if any infants have developed hypothyroidism following maternal intravenous iodine exposure.
Technical factors to performing a CTPA scan in pregnant patients, if required, are also important to consider. Hyperdynamic circulation can render usual triggering bolus mechanisms suboptimal and raise the possibility of a non-diagnostic study.
  V/Q or Q only scanning
V/Q scanning confers a far lower breast dose to the mother but the dose to the foetus, particularly when small, can be greater owing to tracer accumulation within the solid organs of the mother. The mother should be encouraged to adequately hydrate and void frequently in the subsequent hours/days following a scan.
Many institutes choose to perform perfusion scanning only in pregnant women on the understanding that if the perfusion scan is normal then there is no need to go on to perform the ventilation study. The perfusion scan can also be performed at half the usual dose to further reduce the foetal-dose. Naturally doing so comes with the trade-off of lower sensitivity and specificity.
  Gadolinium in pregnancy
Gadolinium also crosses the placenta and is excreted by the foetus into the amniotic fluid. The chelated form of gadolinium in itself poses no risk to the foetus however the free form of gadolinium is teratogenic and the longer the foetus is exposed to the chelated gadolinium administered for the scan, the greater the risk of each molecule of gadolinium becoming dissociated from its chelate. For this reason therefore, gadolinium should only be administered in a patient known to be pregnant, if there is likely to be significant diagnostic benefit from the resultant images.
  Considerations during lactation
Less than 1% of injected iodine or gadolinium is excreted into breast milk and less than 1% of this is then absorbed by the baby's intestinal tract. Although these amounts are considered acceptably low as to not necessitate any breast-feeding cessation advice many families are understandably over-cautious. It is accepted that contrast agents are undetectable in blood 24hours after administration and so any mother wishing to 'pump-and-dump' despite the negligible risks need not do so for longer than a day. Care should, however, be given to counsel the family that it is possible for inadvertent weaning to occur even after short intervals and this should be factored in to any decision made by the family.
Following a nuclear medicine study the risks to the baby are two-fold; firstly from tracer excretion into the breast milk, but also through proximity to the mother during breast-feeding. Recommendations for breast-feeding interruption vary depending on the half-life of the tracer used. For perfusion imaging using technetium (half-life 6 hours) breast milk should be expressed for the first 24 hours following the scan. In theory, it need not be discarded but can safely be bottle-fed to the baby after these 24 hours have elapsed, however in practice many patients none-the-less choose to discard it.
Most tracers simply require adherence to a washout time but of note, the precautions following administration of Gallium-67 based tracers (most commonly used for pyrexia of unknown origin) are much more limiting and, practically speaking, unfortunately lead to complete cessation of breastfeeding. The half-life of Ga-67 is approximately 78 hours. Breastfeeding should, if time allows, be stopped for 2-4 weeks prior to the scan to allow the breast tissue to become less radiosensitive while the tracer circulates within the mother. Where this is an unacceptably long delay for the clinical state of the patient the study can be performed straight away anyway but in either case, milk should also be discarded for at least a further two weeks following the study. Clearly a disruption to breast-feeding of such a long time is far from ideal, even assuming that a patient who is sufficiently unwell as to need a PUO study is able to continue breast-feeding at all, and is likely to lead to complete cessation of breast-feeding. There are other ways to image PUO using Tc99m labelled white blood cells which can be considered.",FALSE,A CT pulmonary angiogram is the best initial test for a suspected pulmonary embolism because it is the most sensitive and specific imaging test for this condition.

CTEPH (Chronic Thromboembolic Pulmonary Hypertension) 
When acute pulmonary emboli fail to resolve there is a danger that their presence will lead to elevated pulmonary arterial pressures i.e CTEPH. The symptoms and radiological signs of CTEPH pertain either to the thrombi or the pulmonary hypertension. Filling defects on CTPA can be expected. Differentiating chronic from acute pulmonary emboli is not an exact science but chronic PEs can display features such as luminal eccentricity (build up of thrombus along the walls of the pulmonary arteries as opposed to central filling defects within the lumen) and calcification. Webs and bands are also features of chronicity - thin, threadlike fibrous structures attached at either end to the vessel wall but free-floating in their mid-portions. Features of the consequent pulmonary hypertension include enlargement of the main pulmonary arteries with stenosis of the peripheral arteries giving rise to a tapered appearance. Right ventricular enlargement and hypertrophy should also be looked for. The bronchial arteries derive from the aorta and thus provide a welcome opportunity for collateralisation thereby maintaining blood flow to lung segments where thrombus is chronically occluding the pulmonary artery.",TRUE,"I chose this because thickening of the interventricular septum is not a common finding in patients with chronic pulmonary emboli.

What is the most likely diagnosis?",SBA: Paediatrics,Germ cell tumour,Normal thymus,Lymphoma,Duplication cyst,Askin Tumour,A,65%,15%,11%,2%,6%,"Explanation:
The key to this question is the presence of calcification in the mass. Calcification in non-treated lymphoma is extremely rare.
  Germ Cell Tumour
This often causes a large anterior mediastinal mass. It can be subdivided into Teratoma (usually cystic with fat and calcification), seminoma (bulky and lobulated) and Non-seminomatous Germ Cell Tumour (haemorrhage and necrosis).
  Lymphoma
This is the most common anterior mediastinal mass in children. It may be difficult to differentiate a lymphoma from normal thymus, particularly in a patient younger than 10 years of age. Associated lymphadenopathy (i.e. cervical) can be the key to distinguishing the two pathologies. Calcification is rare prior to any treatment but can be a feature of lymphoma which has been treated.
  Duplication cyst
These are very rarely found in the anterior mediastinum, usually being posterior mediastinal (neuroenteric) or middle mediastinal (bronchogenic, enteric).
  Askin Tumour
These heterogenous tumours are part of the Ewing Sarcoma spectrum. Patients are often in their early teens. Askin tumours displace rather than invade adjacent mediastinal structures although rib destruction is common and is a fact which can help distinguish it from a pleuropulmonary blastoma which is another cause of a large mediastinal mass, albeit usually found in babies under the age of 2, but which does not cause rib destruction.",FALSE,"Lymphoma is the most likely diagnosis for this 12-year-old boy based on the CT scan findings.

Fat within a thoracic mass is diagnostic of a hamartoma but is only seen in approximately half of cases. In contradistinction to carcinoid tumours, hamartomas tend to be peripherally located whereas carcinoid tumours are often more central. Exceptions to both are reasonably frequent however. Calcification, especially popcorn calcification, is also very classical for hamartomas if present. Cavitation is not a feature often associated with them, but it can be found occasionally. Hamartomas are very similar to the chondromas which form part of the Carney triad (pulmonary chondromas, gastric leiomyosarcomas and extra-adrenal paragangliomas).

Women over the age of 55 is the typical demographic for SIFK but it does also occur in men. It is the adult equivalent to osteochondritis dessicans of the knee. Typically the medial condyle is affected and often there is an associated meniscal tear. On x-ray the appearances are of medial femoral condyle flattening with or without a subchondral radiolucent area. On MRI bone marrow oedema can be seen (high signal on STIR sequences).

This is an association of osteoarthritic changes with a complete rotator cuff tear. On aspiration of the joint fluid both hydroxyapatite and calcium pyrophosphate dehydrate (CPPD) crystals can be found. It tends to affect elderly women following a trauma and presents as a rapidly progressing arthritis. Imaging features are those of advanced osteoarthritis.
  Psoriatic arthropathy
Around a fifth of patients with psoriasis develop arthropathy and it is also possible to suffer from psoriatic arthropathy in the absence of the typical psoriatic cutaneous plaques.
Importantly, on x-ray there are findings of both erosive changes in addition to productive changes with periosteal new bone formation. The combination of the two contrives to leave a ‘pencil-in-cup’ appearance. The joints can appear fluffy due to the exuberance of new bone formation. The differential diagnosis for periosteal reactions in the presence of an arthropathy is relatively narrow and very specific (see table).

What is the most likely diagnosis?,SBA: Musculoskeletal and Trauma,Hyperextension injury,Transient patella dislocation,Pivot shift injury,Clip injury,Dashboard injury,A,57%,1%,15%,5%,22%,"Explanation:
Bony contusions
Bruising to the bone can be detected around 2 days following an injury but may not resolve for many months thereafter. With regards knee injuries, it is often possible to discern the mechanism of injury from the pattern of bruising seen. The contusions follow fluid on MRI scans i.e. low in signal on T1 and high on T2 (and STIR). STIR is used to suppress the fat of the bone marrow thereby making the fluid stand out more.
  Hyperextension injury
These occur often following excessively forceful kicking. There will be bony contusions at the anterior aspect of the tibial plateau and femoral condyles. Either of the anterior or posterior cruciate ligaments may also be involved.
  Transient lateral patella dislocation injury
When the patella dislocates laterally, its medial facet can impact onto the anterolateral corner of the lateral femoral condyle. Both areas become damaged and contusions can be seen on MRI. Often though, the patella reduces spontaneously and thus the exact mechanism of injury must be inferred from the imaging findings.
Joint effusion
Osteochondral injuries to the anterolateral femoral condyle and medial patella facet
Sprain or disruption to the medial retinaculum
  Clip injury and pivot shift injury
These two injuries are very similar. Both involve valgus stress on a flexed knee (such as a tackle to the knee during sports). A pivot shift injury also requires external rotation of the tibia. The three main structures most at risk during these injuries are:
Anterior cruciate ligament (especially in a pivot shift injury)
Medial collateral ligament (especially in a clip injury)
Medial meniscus (remember that the medial meniscus is attached to the medial collateral ligament)
If all three are present together it is referred to as the O’Donoghue triad. Since O’Donoghue defined this triad however, it has been discovered that lateral meniscal tears are actually more common with this type of injury than medial meniscus ones.

Anatomy is the key to differentiating between the various female urogenital cysts most of which are, for the most part, asymptomatic incidental findings.
  Image © Medical Exam Prep
  Bartholin gland cyst
The bartholin glands secrete lubricating fluid into the inferior third of the vagina. They are found in highest numbers at the posterolateral aspect of the inferior vagina. Although usually asymptomatic, when infected or inflamed a Bartholin gland cyst can present as a painful lump. On MRI the T1 characteristics vary depending on the mucoid content but usually they return low signal on T1 and high signal on T2.
  Gartner duct cyst
These are usually found incidentally on MRI scans but can cause dyspareunia.  They do not communicate with the urethra and would be unlikely to cause post-void dribbling. They are remnants of the Wolffian ducts and occur superiorly in the anterolateral wall of the vagina. On imaging they appear straightforwardly cystic. For the most part they occur sporadically but they can also be seen in conjunction with renal agenesis or ectopia and are also typical of a rare condition called Herlyn-Werner-Wunderlich syndrome. This condition causes duplication of all or part of the female genital tract with unilateral haematometrocolpos and ipsilateral renal agenesis. 
  Urethral diverticulum also known as urethrocoele
Dysuria, dyspareunia and post-void dribbling are classical for this condition. An outpouching of the urethral mucosa protrudes through the smooth muscle. This is seen on MRI as high T2 signal adjacent to or surrounding the urethra. Urinary stasis within the diverticulum predisposes patients to the formation of calculi, which can be seen as low signal on the T2 scan, and adenocarcinoma which will enhance with gadolinium.
  Skene duct cyst
These are retention cysts of the paraurethral ducts and usually they are asymptomatic. On MRI they are seen inferior to the pubic symphysis but lateral to the external urethral meatus. Signal characteristics reflect their cystic nature with high T2 signal but fluid-fluid levels may also be present if there has been intracystic haemorrhage.

A large role of acute imaging in stroke is to rule out haemorrhage, and acute haemorrhage is better seen on CT than on MRI.
MRI + DWI has a 20-30% false negative rate within the first 24 hours of symptoms. The only other answer which may be given could be CT perfusion which is often performed in stroke centres. An infarction will obviously cause an increase in the (mean transit time) MTT and is the most sensitive parameter for detecting a stroke. The cerebral blood volume map is used to determine reversibility as it will be severely reduced in frank ischaemia but may be normal or increased in the potentially salvageable penumbra. If there is only a modest reduction in cerebral blood volume but a marked loss of cerebral blood flow this would also indicate potential reversibility.",FALSE,"CTA is the first line of investigation for a stroke patient because it is the most efficient and reliable way to identify the location and size of the clot, which is necessary for administering thrombolysis.

The biliary tract, or biliary tree, is a pathway through which bile that has been secreted by the liver is transported to the duodenum.
The biliary tract begins as the interlobular bile ducts form the right and left hepatic ducts. These two ducts merge to form the common hepatic duct, which is situated alongside the hepatic vein.
The common hepatic duct exits the liver and joins with the cystic duct from the gallbladder to form the common bile duct. The common bile duct is sometimes referred to as the ‘trunk of the biliary tree’ and together with the hepatic artery and hepatic portal vein forms the central axis of the portal triad.
The common bile duct passes downwards posteriorly to the proximal duodenum and joins with the pancreatic duct from the pancreas to form the ampulla of Vater. The ampulla of Vater opens into the duodenum and the release of bile at this point is controlled by a muscular valve called the sphincter of Oddi.

13756,207854,"A 3-year-old girl is reviewed by the paediatricians having been admitted with a lower respiratory tract infection. This is her third similar admission and other less severe episodes have been treated in the community. Testing for cystic fibrosis is negative.

In questions on TOF, the age of the patient is important. A 3-year-old child with TOF is likely to have presented with recurrent LRTIs and a type E or type H TOF. In this instance the NG tube might reach T8 (it would still be abnormally placed if it only reaches T8 but that may be procedural as opposed to pathological). On the other hand a neonate presenting with difficulty in feeding due to a TOF will have a type A or C TOF and in these cases the NG tube would not reach T8.
  Trache-oesophageal fistula (TOF)
The most common type of TOF involves a blind ending proximal oesophagus with the distal oesophagus connecting to the trachea. This accounts for around 80% of cases and patients present at an early stage with difficulty feeding. Since the distal oesophagus is connected to the trachea, gas does reach the bowel.
In all likelihood if the NG tube has reached T8 then the oesophagus is normally developed although it may still have a fistulous connection to the trachea. This type of TOF presents later with recurrent pneumonias due to aspirated fluids. An NG tube within the oesophagus at T8 is still malpositioned; the tip should be below the diaphragm. The NG tube should be advanced and the x-ray repeated if this were the case.

9501,207854,"A 36-year-old woman presents with abdominal pains and, more recently, bloody diarrhoea. She is reviewed in A&E and due her degree of tenderness undergoes a CT abdomen and pelvis with contrast. While reviewing the scan you suspect she may have an inflammatory bowel disease. Which of the following features would favour a diagnosis of ulcerative colitis over one of Crohn disease?",SBA: Gastrointestinal,Circumferential wall thickening,Thickened ileocaecal valve,Fistula formation,Skip lesions,Normal rectum,A,75%,9%,5%,2%,8%,"Explanation:
Thickening of the ileocaecal valve, fistula formation and skip lesions are all features more closely associated with Crohn disease. In ulcerative colitis the rectum is usually affected and the colitis progresses proximally from there. Circumferential wall thickening is better associated with ulcerative colitis which affects the mucosa and submucosa, than Crohn disease which can be patchy and causes transmural inflammation. It is, however, possible to see circumferential wall thickening in the context of Crohn disease too but of the above features it is the most indicative of a diagnosis of ulcerative colitis.
  Ulcerative colitis
Whereas Crohns disease causes discontinuous transmural inflammation in ulcerative colitis it is a continuous segment of bowel which is affected beginning at the rectum and progressing proximally. Additionally, it is only the mucosa and submucosa which are affected. Patients present with symptoms of abdominal pain, bloody diarrhoea and experience relapses and periods of remission with the disease. In general, the small bowel is spared with the exception of the terminal ileum which can be affected in a so-called ‘backwash ileitis’ manner. On imaging colonic mucosal hyperenhancement can sometimes be seen, along with mucosal oedema (so-called thumbprinting). On fluoroscopic studies pseudopolyps can be seen – these are actually islands of normal mucosa or granulation tissue surrounded on all sides by inflammation. In the chronic phase the colon may become narrower, smooth and featureless as the haustral markings are lost. This is described as a lead-pipe appearance.
  Crohn disease
Crohn disease is characterised by discontinuous (skip lesions) transmural non-caseating granulomatous inflammation. By contrast, ulcerative colitis is characterised by continuous mucosal inflammation. Crohn disease is usually diagnosed in adolescence or young adulthood and patients present with non-specific abdominal pains, diarrhoea, weight loss and anaemia. Crohn disease can affect any part of the entire length of the gastrointestinal tract, in contrast to ulcerative colitis which affects only the colon, but owing to the high concentration of lymphoid tissue in the terminal ileum the vast majority of patients will have terminal ileal involvement, in particular thickening of the iliocaecal valve. Aphthous ulceration is common and on endoscopy a cobblestone appearance to the mucosa can be seen where the thickened and oedematous wall is broken up by deep longitudinal fissures. Deep ‘rosethorn’ ulcers can be seen on fluoroscopic studies.  Strictures and fistulae characterise the chronic sequelae of this disease.

There are a few key features to cerebellopontine angle masses which help distinguish them from one another. In this particular question the arachnoid cyst is the red herring that proves the rule – although not classically a CP angle tumour, they can occur anywhere and should be easily identified since they follow CSF signals on all modalities and sequences, thus there is high T2 signal, not seen on FLAIR, and no restriction on DWI. A choroid plexus cyst is not a CP angle mass.
Epidermoid cysts restrict diffusion. This is thought to be due to the linear configuration of keratin fibres seen at a microscopic level giving them a higher level of anisotropy than adjacent white matter.

Select ONE answer only.,SBA: Gastrointestinal,Hepatic veno-occlusive disease,Budd Chiari syndrome,Portal vein thrombus,Graft vs Host disease,Constrictive pericarditis,A,50%,12%,4%,24%,10%,"Explanation:
Veno-occlusive disease develops within the first 20-30 days following transplantation however graft vs host disease occurs after 3-12 months following transplantation.
Graft vs Host disease
When T-cells from the donor bone marrow attack epithelial cells in the recipient a phenomenon known as Graft versus Host disease can occur. Within the liver this can lead to fibrosis and can present in a similar manner to veno-occlusive dsease. The effects are classically seen in the GI tract and the skin as opposed to the lungs but pulmonary manifestations can arise a few months after the transplant. On CT there is mild perihilar fibrosis with nodule formation.
Hepatic venous outflow obstruction
There are three separate syndromes which all overlap both in terms of their clinical and radiological features. They are, however, separate entities, caused by subtly different processes.
Passive hepatic congestion – this arises due to a cardiac problem such as right sided heart failure of any cause or constrictive pericarditis. Tender hepatomegaly is common and on imaging the hepatic veins and IVC are notably enlarged.
Budd-Chiari syndrome – the pathology here is within the hepatic veins with thrombosis or other non-thrombotic obstruction (e.g. extrinsic compression). Acutely there is abdominal pain, ascites and hepatomegaly. The presence or absence of caudate lobe hypertrophy can help distinguish between a chronic process or an acute one where this has not had sufficient time to develop.

Select ONE answer only.,"SBA: Genito urinary, Adrenal, Obstetrics & Gynaecology and Breast",Ureteric orifice,Trigone,Urachal cyst,Bladder diverticulum,Urachal diverticulum,A,38%,35%,12%,10%,5%,"Explanation:
Please note that the question asks for the LEAST likely answer.
Adenocarcinoma of the bladder
Certain areas within the bladder show an increased prevalence of adenocarcinoma - in particular, the bladder base, urethrocoeles (not technically bladder), and any urachal remnants found in the midline. Urachal remnant carcinomas account for around 30% of adenocarcinomas of the bladder. Carcinomas of the prostate are most commonly adenocarcinoma and although usually it is readily possible to differentiate between a prostatic malignancy and a bladder tumour on MRI, there may be advanced invasive cases where the line is more blurred. It is important clinically to differentiate between secondary adenocarcinomas which have metastasized from elsewhere and primary adenocarcinomas as the treatment is obviously very different. This is a histological diagnosis however, not radiological. Secondary adenocarcinomas are more common than primary adenocarcinomas.
For the most part, imaging is not able to distinguish between the different cell types with any degree of reliability; the diagnosis is histological.
Other bladder cancers:
Cell type Percentage
Transitional cell carcinoma >90-95
Squamous cell carcinoma 2-15 (strong geographical variation)
Adenocarcinoma (primary) <2
Sarcoma <2
  Transitional cell carcinoma
Transitional carcinoma makes up around 95% of urinary tract cancers in the UK. The vast majority affect the bladder. The renal pelvis is the second most commonly affected site. The ureter is the least common site of malignancy. The lower third is affected in around 75% of cases, followed by the middle third. The proximal third is affected in only around 3% or ureteric malignancies. Bladder diverticulae, if present, pose an increased risk of tumour development due to urinary stasis within them. These also show invasive features at an earlier stage owing to the paucity of protective muscle surrounding them.
Smokers are at vastly increased risk of developing TCC due to the prolonged contact of carcinogens excreted in urine with the bladder wall.
Squamous cell carcinoma
Both SCC and adenocarcinomas of the bladder are linked to entities which cause chronic bladder irritation such as long term catheters, bladder stones and chronic urinary tract infection. In developing countries, infection with schistosomiasis strongly skews the prevalence data as it is known to cause squamous cell carcinoma of the bladder.
Urethral diverticulum (urethrocoele)
Dysuria, dyspareunia and post-void dribbling are classical for this condition. An outpouching of the urethral mucosa protrudes through the smooth muscle. This is seen on MRI as high T2 signal adjacent to or surrounding the urethra. Urinary stasis within the diverticulum predisposes patients to the formation of calculi, which can be seen as low signal on the T2 scan, and adenocarcinoma which will enhance with gadolinium.
Urachal cyst (extraprostatic)
The urachus is a fibrous remnant of a thin canal connecting the bladder to the umbilicus. Ordinarily it is almost imperceptible however there are four distinct anomalies which can persist into adulthood and cause symptoms.
Patency – a fistula between the bladder and the umbilicus. There is leakage of urine from the umbilicus present from birth.
Sinus – blind dilatation of the urachus at the umbilical end.
Diverticulum – communication with the dome of the bladder
Cyst – dilatation in the lower third which does not communicate with either end. These are asymptomatic unless or until the cyst becomes infected or ruptures.
  Malignancy arising from the urachas, unlike most bladder cancer, tends to be adenocarcinoma. In young patients sarcomas are also seen.
MRI bladder
Imaging the bladder with MRI is a balancing act between sufficient distension to achieve adequate sensitivity rates without the images being compromised by motion due to the discomfort of having a full bladder for the duration of the scan.
On T2 the detrusor muscle returns low signal but the continuity of this layer will be disrupted if there is invasion.
The T1 images are more useful for evaluating lymph node involvement and any bony metastases.
Post-contrast images are of limited use in bladder cancer imaging. Some literature does support their use since the tumours tend to enhance early, whereas the muscle layer undergoes only delayed enhancement but since the bladder mucosa and submucosa also enhance in the early phase the appearances can be confusing to the untrained eye.",FALSE,"I chose this option because the urachal cyst is the least common site for a primary adenocarcinoma of the bladder. This is because the urachal cyst is a rare congenital anomaly that is formed by the remnant of the urachus, which is a tube that connects the bladder to the umbilicus during fetal development. This anomaly is usually asymptomatic, and thus is not usually detected. As such, it is much less likely to be the site of a primary adenocarcinoma of the bladder than other more commonly encountered sites such as the trigone, ureteric orifice, bladder diverticulum, and urachal diverticulum.",1,"3.

NF1 (Neurofibromatosis type 1) is the ‘peripheral’ version. There are plenty of cerebral features described however NF2 (Neurofibromatosis type 2) is almost exclusively cerebral and is therefore by comparison the ‘central’ version.

Although the classical schwannoma seen is that involving cranial nerve VIII, they can be found on other cranial nerves.

The MRI shows enlarged lymph nodes Involvement of which of the following groups of lymph nodes would be considered as regional disease?,"SBA: Genito urinary, Adrenal, Obstetrics & Gynaecology and Breast",Internal and external iliac nodes,Inguinal and common iliac nodes,"Inguinal, external iliac and common iliac nodes",Inguinal and external iliac nodes,Para-aortic and common iliac nodes,A,38%,27%,14%,14%,7%,"Explanation:
The most important lymph node groups in the context of a pelvic malignancy are the internal, external and common iliac nodes, the inguinal, perivisceral and para-aortic nodes. It is important to recognise the distinction between what is considered as a regional lymph node for a given organ, and what would be non-regional. Involvement of non-regional lymph nodes is taken as metastatic disease which has huge implications on subsequent patient management.
For bladder cancer, both the internal and external iliac nodes are considered as regional disease. Recently the common iliac nodes have also been reclassifiied as regional disease. These would confer N3 staging.

10766,207854,You are reporting a CTPA scan which has filling defects bilaterally in the pulmonary arteries. Which of the following would favour a diagnosis of acute emboli over chronic emboli?,SBA: Cardiothoracic and vascular,Railway track sign,Eccentric mural thrombus,Enlarged main pulmonary artery,Bronchial artery collaterals,Contrast in the hepatic veins,A,55%,12%,17%,1%,15%,"Explanation:
Enlargement of the pulmonary arteries can be seen when there is severe right heart strain but an enlarged main pulmonary artery is more associated with chronic pulmonary emboli leading to pulmonary hypertension.
Contrast within the hepatic veins is seen when there is tricuspid regurgitation and can be seen in both acute and chronic pulmonary emboli.
The polo mint sign is seen when the CT slice is at 90o to the direction of flow in a given pulmonary artery.
The railway track sign is seen when the CT slice is in line with the direction of flow.
Eccentricity of the thrombus is more suggestive of a chronic pulmonary embolus. Acute emboli sit within the lumen of the artery and where they touch the wall of the artery will subtend an acute angle, whereas chronic emboli flatten against the walls of the artery in a crescenteric shape and thereby subtend an obtuse angle.
Bronchial artery collaterals form in the setting of chronic pulmonary emboli.
  Acute pulmonary emboli
Filling defects within the pulmonary arteries can be seen on any post-contrast CT scans but a dedicated CT pulmonary angiogram has a higher sensitivity in this regard. The polo mint and railtrack signs are given as signs of acute pulmonary emboli. Acute emboli also sit within the lumen of the pulmonaries and therefore subtend an acute angle with the wall. When the clot load is haemodynamically significant features of right heart strain can be seen. These include bowing of the interventricular septum, right ventricular enlargement (the right ventricle should not be larger than the left ventricle). Dilatation of the main pulmonary artery (the main pulmonary artery should not be larger than the aorta). There are various features which can help determine the chronicity of an embolus or emboli. These are summarised in the table below:
  Acute
Chronic
Tricuspid regurgitation – contrast in hepatic veins
Acute angles
Obtuse angles

Bronchial artery collaterals

  CTEPH (Chronic Thromboembolic Pulmonary Hypertension) 
When acute pulmonary emboli fail to resolve there is a danger that their presence will lead to elevated pulmonary arterial pressures i.e CTEPH. The symptoms and radiological signs of CTEPH pertain either to the thrombi or the pulmonary hypertension. Filling defects on CTPA can be expected. Differentiating chronic from acute pulmonary emboli is not an exact science but chronic PEs can display features such as luminal eccentricity (build up of thrombus along the walls of the pulmonary arteries as opposed to central filling defects within the lumen) and calcification. Webs and bands are also features of chronicity - thin, threadlike fibrous structures attached at either end to the vessel wall but free-floating in their mid-portions. Features of the consequent pulmonary hypertension include enlargement of the main pulmonary arteries with stenosis of the peripheral arteries giving rise to a tapered appearance. Right ventricular enlargement and hypertrophy should also be looked for. The bronchial arteries derive from the aorta and thus provide a welcome opportunity for collateralisation thereby maintaining blood flow to lung segments where thrombus is chronically occluding the pulmonary artery.

9266,207854,In a teaching session you are presented with an MRI scan which shows low T2 signal in the spleen.

Which of the following is NOT a possible explanation?,SBA: Gastrointestinal,Amiodarone therapy,Haemochromatosis,Spherocytosis,Sickle Cell Disease,MRI safe prosthetic heart valve,A,39%,17%,6%,9%,29%,"Explanation:
Please note that the question asks for the answer which is NOT a likely option
  Amiodarone therapy
Amiodarone is an anti-arrhythmic drug which contains iodine (am-IOD-arone). Consequently, as it accumulates in the liver, it can cause significant increase in density on CT. The MRI signal is unaffected.
  Haemochromatosis
The primary version of this disease can be inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion. Excess dietary iron is absorbed and this accumulates in all tissues of the body leading to various different problems.
Secondary haemochromatosis can arise if patients receive numerous blood transfusions without sufficient chelation to mitigate against the iron overload.
Cirrhosis – the presence of the excess iron in the liver leads to unusual signal properties on an MRI scan. Iron is paramagnetic and causes spin dephasing. T2* and T2 sequences are particularly vulnerable to this effect but lower than expected signal will be seen on all sequences. Importantly the signal from the spleen and bone marrow should be normal. By contrast they will be involved in cases of transfusional siderosis.
Generalised osteoporosis

14171,207854,A 16-year-old male undergoes an x-ray of his right knee which shows scalloping of the distal femoral metadiaphyseal region. An MRI shows a tumour situated in the vastus medialis. There is heterogenous T1 and T2 signal centrally and a low signal rim surrounding the mass. On the gradient echo sequence the low signal rim becomes even darker. What is the most likely diagnosis? Select ONE answer only.,SBA: Musculoskeletal and Trauma,Haemophilia,PVNS,SAPHO,Telangiectetic osteosarcoma,Lipoma arborescens,A,43%,15%,5%,31%,6%,"Explanation:
Haemophilic arthropathy
The larger joints are most at risk for this disease, and the knee is particularly classical. On an x-ray there may only be a joint effusion in early disease but erosions and subchondral cysts develop. In particular there may be widening of the intercondylar notch (for which there is a differential diagnosis of: JIA/RA, Psoriatic arthropathy, TB and haemophilia) due to pannus formation. Also classical is epiphyseal overgrowth secondary to hyperaemia. On an MRI there may well be nodular deposits on the synovium however the presence of blood degradation products renders these very low in signal on all sequences with blooming artefact present on gradient echo sequences or similar. If a haemarthrosis is present, the signal of the fluid will change depending on the chronicity of the event.
A haemophilic pseudotumour occurs in around 1-2% of patients with haemophilia. The presence of blood degradation products leads to a wide variety of intralesional signal patterns. The lesions are usually surrounded by a low signal haemosiderin rim though. Lesions can arise within bone (intra-osseous) or in soft tissues (usually muscular). Growth and pressure effects on adjacent bone can cause scalloping.
PVNS - Pigmented villonodular synovitis
The classic joint to be affected by PVNS is the knee but it can also occur at other large joints. Usually only one joint is affected in each patient. On x-ray the only sign may be a joint effusion. Large subchondral cysts can also be seen. On MRI however, the appearances are characteristic. Haemorrhagic proliferation of the synovium in a frond-like fashion gives rise to the classic low signal 'feathery' sea-anemone-like finding. On susceptibility weighted sequences there is blooming artefact owing to the presence of haemosiderin. Patients are usually middle-aged and treatment is with synovectomy although there is a high rate of recurrence. If the patient is male, the usual differential diagnosis for PVNS is of haemophilic arthropathy owing to the presence of blood products there too. PVNS appears as a differential diagnosis for subarticular lucent bone lesions due to the formation of large subchondral cysts.
Lipoma arborescens
This condition can affect children or adults and is thought to be a reaction to chronic inflammation of the synovium leading to extensive fatty infiltration of the synovium. It is almost always the knee which is affected. Plain radiographs will show only an effusion, which may be large, but on MRI there is frond-like or nodular synovial proliferation which returns fat-signal according to the different sequences used. The signal should be high on T1 and T2 but suppress on fat-saturated sequences. Post-contrast the synovium itself will enhance. Treatment is by synovectomy.
SAPHO (Synovitis, acne, palmoplantar pustulosis, hyperostosis, osteitis)
This disease is thought to be a variant of psoriatic arthropathy. The cutaneous manifestations may not be apparent at diagnosis (like psoriatic arthropathy) but hyperostosis and osteolysis and ankylosis of the sternoclavicular joint is absolutely typical. On a nuclear medicine bone scan, bilateral uptake in the sternoclavicular joints and manubrium is called a ‘bull’s head’ sign. About a third of patients also have spinal disease with paravertebral ossifications and osteosclerosis. Unilateral sacroiliitis may also occur. Appearances can be quite striking on CT. In the knees, ankles and small joints of the hands there may be inflammation of the joints with juxta-articular osteoporosis.
Osteosarcoma
These are bone forming tumours which can either be primary, or secondary. Primary osteosarcomas occur in young patients or young adults when the bones are more active during adolescence than in later life, and have a predilection for either the proximal tibia or distal femur i.e. around the knee joint. Secondary osteosarcomas occur as malignant degeneration of pre-existing bone lesions. Clinically they present as a painful mass with a fever. Pain on movement is also typical. In later disease patients may have a raised serum ALP. On x-ray they are poorly defined aggressive lesions with sunburst periosteal reaction and fluffy cloud-like osseous matrix. For staging the patient should receive an MRI of the entire of the affected bone (to rule out synchronous lesions), a nuclear medicine bone scan and a CT chest. Tissue biopsy should only be performed at tertiary referral centres where to mitigate the risk of seeding the biopsy tract, immediate tissue analysis with the option of immediate amputation can be performed.
Secondary osteosarcomas:
Paget disease
Bone infarct
Osteochondroma
Osteoblastoma
Radiotherapy change
  In the case of a parosteal osteosarcoma, the attachment to the underlying bone may be thin and stalk-like but will be present. Depending on the view a radiolucent plane may seem present for some of the length of the tumour, giving rise to ‘string sign’ appearance, but an attachment to the parent bone will be present.",FALSE,"SAPHO is the most likely diagnosis because the MRI findings are consistent with the diagnosis. The scalloped distal femoral metadiaphyseal region is a common finding in SAPHO, and the MRI findings of a heterogenous T1 and T2 signal centrally, with a low signal rim surrounding the mass, and the gradient echo sequence showing an even darker low signal rim are all characteristic of SAPHO.",2,,B,FALSE,,D,FALSE,B
12601,207854,A 30-year-old man with known HIV presents with neurological deterioration. He undergoes imaging which shows lesions in the frontal lobes. These are shown to be hypometabolic. What is the most likely diagnosis?,SBA: Central Nervous and Head & Neck,Toxoplasmosis,HIV encephalopathy,Lymphoma,Cryptococcus,Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy,A,56%,15%,6%,10%,13%,"Explanation:
Cryptococcus
This is an opportunistic yeast-like fungus which therefore requires a degree of immunocompromise, typically AIDS. The cryptococcomas are non-enhancing low density lesions in the basal ganglia. These show as high signal on T2 sequences. A granulomatous meningitis can also occur. They can be differentiated from VR spaces on FLAIR where VR spaces will suppress (being CSF in content) whereas the mucoid cryptococcomas will not.
    Toxoplasmosis
Toxoplasmosis is a more common finding in AIDS patients than lymphoma is, by a large margin. On MRI it is seen as multiple ring enhancing lesions, which can show haemorrhage particularly following treatment. One of the stronger differentiators between toxoplasmosis and lymphoma is the SPECT findings. This is sometimes termed ‘hypometabolic’ meaning the lesions do not demonstrate SPECT uptake. The table below gives some general features of the two conditions. There is however considerable overlap in the imaging features despite these broad trends.

  Lymphoma
A ring solitary ring enhancing lesion in the context of an AIDS patient should raise lymphoma as a strong possibility. Multiple lesions can and do occur however, making the distinction from toxoplasmosis challenging. Lymphoma is also part of the differential diagnosis for lesions that cross the corpus callosum and this can be a feature that separates it from toxoplasmosis, although is not a feature of exclusion. Similarly if haemorrhage has been seen associated with the lesion this is more a feature of toxoplasmosis but absence of haemorrhage does not exclude toxoplasmosis.
  HIV encephalopathy
Separating HIV encephalitis from PML can challenging in real life. HIV encephalitis causes bilateral symmetrical white matter changes, seen as high T2 signal (The T1 sequences can be normal). There is also sparing of the subcortical U-fibres.
  Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML)
This is a JC virus mediated phenomenon which causes asymmetrical patchy white matter changes. These can be bilateral. The testable feature is involvement of the cortical U-fibres which separates it from HIV encephalopathy where the U-fibres are spared.",FALSE,"I chose this answer because HIV encephalopathy is a common neurological complication of HIV infection. It is characterized by hypometabolic lesions in the frontal lobes and can lead to neurological deterioration.

The kidneys are two retroperitoneal organs that lie on the posterior abdominal wall. They are responsible for electrolyte and fluid balance and also for the filtration and excretion of waste products from the blood.
Each kidney lies on its respective side of the vertebral column between the T12 and L3 vertebral levels. The right kidney lies slightly lower than the left because of the presence of the large right lobe of the liver. The kidney moves during respiration, one particular study noted that the maximal vertical motion of the superior pole of the kidney from its end-expiratory to its end-inspiratory position is around 40 mm.
At the concave medial margin of each kidney is a vertical cleft called the renal hilum. This is the point where the renal artery and vein enter and exit the kidney respectively. The hila of the kidney lie approximately in the transpyloric plane at the L1 vertebral level.

Please note that the question asks for the feature LEAST suggestive of actinomycosis.
Actinomycosis
The bacterium actinomyces israelii produces proteases which allows it to cross structures which would otherwise present a barrier to spread of infection. Within the abdominal cavity actinomycosis leads to abscess formation, and fistula development. It is usual for the patient to have previously suffered a ruptured appendix or to be using an IUCD, or other similar entities. In the case of an IUCD, tuboovarian abscesses can form and spread locally to involve the psoas. Extrinsic ureteric compression leads to hydronephrosis.",FALSE,"IUCD in situ is not indicative of actinomycosis because it is not a symptom of the disease.

IOTA rules (International Ovarian Tumour Analysis)
In comparison to many other cancers, ovarian cancer has a relatively poor prognosis, partly on account of the vague nature of symptoms leading to presentation but also due to the limitations of diagnosis by ultrasound (often the first line of investigation for patients who end up being diagnosed with ovarian cancer).
The IOTA rules were designed to standardise ultrasound findings in ovarian lesions.
Two sets of rules were drawn up; M-rules and B-rules (indicating malignant and benign characteristics respectively). The rules have been designed to be as simple as possible, for general use by anyone capable of performing transabdominal or transvaginal imaging of the ovaries.
  Malignant = One or more M-rule, no B-rules
Benign = One or more B-rules, no M-rules
Indeterminate = everything else
  B-rules
M-rules
B1 = Unilocular cyst
M1 = Solid, irregular mass
B2 = <7mm solid component
M2 = Ascites
B3 = Acoustic shadow 
M3 = >3 papillary structures
B4 = Multilocular cyst <10cm
M4 = Multilocular solid mass >10cm
B5 = No blood flow
M5 = Blood flow
    Ovarian cancer
There are a number of different types of ovarian carcinoma and the final diagnosis will be a histological one. On imaging the features can be varied.
Subtypes Frequency and Age
Malignant epithelial tumours (Serous, mucinous, endometroid, clear cell) 85% (60s -70s)
Malignant germ cell tumours (Teratoma, dysgerminoma, choriocarcinoma, mixed) 7% (<30 years)
Metastases <10%
Sex cord stromal tumours ~5%
  A number of factors increase the risk of developing ovarian cancer in an individual. Anything which increases the number of ovulatory cycles a woman undergoes in her lifetime will increase the risk of ovarian cancer (early menarche, late menopause, nulliparity), and vice versa (multiparity, breastfeeding, oral contraceptive pill use). A family history of related cancers also increases the risk.
Presenting symptoms may be quite vague with abdominal pains, constipation or urinary frequency being the only complaints if any from the patient. Consequently, many tumours have already spread beyond the ovary by the time of diagnosis. Initial investigation is often with ultrasound. Although ovarian cancers can have a variety of imaging appearances, solid or papillary components to a cystic mass are strongly indicative of malignancy. Predominantly solid masses with some small cystic components are also likely to be malignant but completely perfectly solid lesions are actually more likely to be benign. Ovarian fibromas and fibrothecomas are both benign lesions which can be seen as solid masses however despite this, without prior imaging for comparison a solid ovarian lesion is malignant until proven otherwise.
Ovarian cancer can spread in a multitude of ways:
Direct extension Sigmoid mesocolon, broad ligament, fallopian tubes
Intraperitoneal seeding and implantation Omental caking, peritoneal space
Lymphatic spread External iliac, obturator nodes
Haematogenous Liver, lung, adrenal glands, pleural effusion
  Bowel obstruction is relatively common with disseminated ovarian cancer however it is usually large bowel obstruction. Small bowel obstruction is far less common.",FALSE,"I chose this answer because the IOTA rules state that lesions with a size of 5cm or greater should be classified as indeterminate.

Which of the following makes lung cancer a more likely diagnosis than round atelectasis? Select ONE answer only.,SBA: Cardiothoracic and vascular,It is not associated with pleural plaques,There are air bronchograms within it,The lesion enhances post contrast,The lesion has a curvilinear shape,Comet tail sign is present,A,36%,16%,41%,3%,5%,"Explanation:
Both lung cancer and round atelectasis show enhancement post contrast.
A lack of association with pleural plaques would make this lesion even more suspicious for lung cancer than if they were present when the possibility of round atelectasis is more likely. Having said that, even in the presence of pleural plaques, of course a lung cancer would still need to be excluded.
  Round atelectasis
Round atelectasis occurs most commonly as part of the spectrum of asbestos related findings but does have other lesser aetiologies. It is also referred to as ‘infolded lung’ which better describes the appearances seen on CT. On CT there is a rounded mass-like region adjacent to the pleural surface. A comet tail sign is seen coming from the mass where the bronchovascular structures supplying the affected part of the lung are pulled into the centre of it thus there is a linear opacity curving outwards from the mass and pointing towards the hilum. The pleura adjacent to the mass is often thickened and if the mass is sufficiently large, features of volume loss can be seen in the ipsilateral hemithorax. Owing to the association with asbestos the patient may well show other features of exposure such as pleural plaque disease.
  Pleural plaques
When calcified pleural plaques are seen bilaterally it is virtually pathognomonic of prior asbestos exposure. Of all asbestos related pleural plaques around 85% are calcified. Involvement of the mediastinum should raise the possibility of mesothelioma but involvement of the costophrenic angles should raise the possibility of an alternative diagnosis as these are usually spared in asbestos related plaque disease. Unilateral pleural plaques can be caused by any previous insult such as surgery or an empyema although the most common cause is still asbestos related lung disease.",FALSE,"Air bronchograms are seen in lung cancer but not in round atelectasis. Air bronchograms are seen when the airways within a lesion are visible on imaging, indicating that the lesion is partially obstructing the airway. This is a sign of a more advanced lesion, which is more likely to be cancerous than round atelectasis.",2,"This question falls under category 2: A question about clinical judgement, what is the correct diagnosis?",B,TRUE,,A,FALSE,C
10706,207854,"A 67-year-old man develops a swollen, tender, pulsatile mass in his right groin two days after a diagnostic cardiac angiogram. He undergoes an ultrasound which demonstrates a 2.5cm pseudoaneurysm of the profunda femoris artery. What is the most appropriate next management?",SBA: Cardiothoracic and vascular,US guided thrombin injection,Conservative management with repeat USS in 48hrs,Fluoroscopy guided thrombin injection,Surgical ligation,Manual compression under USS guidance,A,71%,8%,4%,3%,14%,"Explanation:
Approximately 1-2% of cardiac catheterizations are complicated by femoral pseudoaneurysm formation. An iatrogenic pseudoaneurysm forms when there is contained leakage of blood from a vessel puncture site. The sac of blood communicates with the lumen and continuous flow within the pseudoaneurysm prevents clot formation. Pseudoaneurysms pose a significant risk of rupture with potentially catastrophic consequences if they do. Risk factors for pseudoaneurysm formation include:
Patient related
Anticoagulation
Haemodialysis
Calcified arteries
Obesity
Procedural
Low puncture sites (SFA or profunda femoris)
Suboptimal post-procedure pressure
Some aneurysms do spontaneously thrombose. Ultrasound follow up is not completely unreasonable as a management technique where further intervention is relatively or absolutely contra-indicated, and with appropriate patient counselling regarding risks.
Small pseudoaneurysms (<2cm diameter) can usually be managed non-invasively with manual compression. The goal of manual compression is to occlude the neck of the pseudoaneurysm. This causes stasis within the sac and facilitates clotting. USS is a useful adjunct to compression.
Larger pseudoaneurysms are often amenable to occlusion via ultrasound guided thrombin injection. The average size for pseudoaneurysms amenable to thrombin injection is around 3cm diameter. Larger pseudoaneuryms can be managed with thrombin but It is only safe to perform this if manual compression during the injection is able to satisfactorily occlude the neck of the aneurysm to prevent thrombin embolising distally. Thrombin injection can be used even for patients undergoing anticoagulation with heparin or warfarin and even for higher pseudoaneurysms of the groin region, above the inguinal ligament.
For pseudoaneurysms not amenable to either of these two management strategies surgical ligation would be the next option. Endovascular stenting is not usually performed for femoral pseudoaneurysms owing to the risk of kink formation within the stent on hip flexion. Endovascular coiling is also unsuitable for femoral pseudoaneurysms as the femoral artery is an inexpendable vessel; coiling it would risk leg ischaemia.",TRUE,"US guided thrombin injection is the most appropriate next management for a patient with a pseudoaneurysm of the profunda femoris artery. This is because US guided thrombin injection is a minimally invasive procedure which can be used to effectively seal the aneurysm, reducing the risk of rupture and bleeding. This procedure is also less invasive than surgical ligation and is less likely to cause complications than manual compression under US guidance. Additionally, it is more effective than conservative management with repeat USS in 48 hours, as it can immediately address the aneurysm and reduce the risk of rupture.",2,"3.

Anatomy plays a strong role in the correct diagnosis of male genitourinary tract cysts. It is first necessary to differentiate between intraprostatic cysts and extraprostatic cysts.
  Prostatic utricle cyst (intraprostatic)
These are found in teenagers or adolescents and represent incomplete regression of the Mullerian duct system during embryological development. They are found posterior to the bladder, within the prostate, and do not extend any more superiorly than the superior most aspect of the prostate. This anatomical detail and the fact that the cyst does communicate with the prostatic urethra sets it apart from a Mullerian duct cyst on imaging. They can cause all manner of lower urinary tract symptoms and boast an association with ipsilateral renal agenesis as well as intersex disorders. On MRI they are said to have a pear shaped appearance.
  Mullerian duct cyst (intraprostatic)
These are usually found in young adult men and are also caused by incomplete regression of the Mullerian duct. They have numerous similarities with prostatic utricle cysts, although the latter is associated with other congenital anomalies whereas Mullerian duct cysts are, classically, not. Anatomically they are also posterior to the bladder however unlike prostatic utricle cysts they extend superiorly to the prostate and do not communicate with the urethra. On MRI they appear straightforwardly cystic unless complicated by infection. The shape of the cyst is said to be teardrop shaped rather than the pear shaped prostatic utricle cysts.

  Seminal vesicle cyst (extraprostatic)
Seminal vesicle cysts form due to stenosis or atresia of the ejaculatory ducts and can be post-infective in nature or congenital. They tend to present in adolescence due to the increase in secretions around this time. Acquired cysts are seen later on in life. The signal characteristics on MRI are variable depending on the presence or absence of haemorrhage. Anatomically it should be easy to pinpoint their location as relating to the seminal vesicles, namely posterior to the bladder and superior to the prostate. Congenital seminal vesicle cysts are associated with renal anomalies and adult polycystic kidney disease.
  Urachal cyst (extraprostatic)
The urachus is a fibrous remnant of a thin canal connecting the bladder to the umbilicus. Ordinarily it is almost imperceptible however there are four distinct anomalies which can persist into adulthood and cause symptoms.
Patency – a fistula between the bladder and the umbilicus. There is leakage of urine from the umbilicus present from birth.
Sinus – blind dilatation of the urachus at the umbilical end.
Diverticulum – communication with the dome of the bladder
Cyst – dilatation in the lower third which does not communicate with either end. These are asymptomatic unless or until the cyst becomes infected or ruptures.
Malignancy arising from the urachas, unlike most bladder cancer, tends to be adenocarcinoma. In young patients sarcomas are also seen.
  Cystic prostate cancer
Carcinoma of the prostate does not usually present as a cystic mass but the presence of haemorrhage within a cystic mass should raise the possibility of malignancy. Most prostate cancer arises from the peripheral zone and is seen as low T2 signal with restriction of diffusion. Cystic prostate cancer will return high signal on T2. The main differential diagnosis is a prostatic abscess.",FALSE,"The most likely diagnosis is Urachal Cyst. This is because the MRI showed a pear-shaped cystic lesion posterior to the bladder with a distinct communication with the urethra. Additionally, the left kidney was notably absent. These symptoms are consistent with an Urachal Cyst, which is a cyst that forms from the remnants of the urachus, a tube that connects the bladder to the umbilicus in a developing fetus.",2,,B,TRUE,,A,FALSE,E

Boerhaave syndrome
Benign oesophageal rupture can occur during foreceful vomiting and causes sudden chest pain. Most occur along the left hand wall of the oesophagus and hence initially the most common finding is a left sided pleural effusion. Fluid escapes into the pleural cavity and although aspiration may have occurred during the vomiting, consolidation develops later on, if at all. Tertiary contractions refer to non-propulsive oesophageal contractions and are a feature of achalasia. If Boerhaave syndrome is suspected the patient should not receive oral barium since it can raise a fibrotic process in the pleura. Water soluble contrast media such as gastrograffin should be used instead.
Importantly, the patients risk of aspiration must also be taken into account. If the patient has an unsafe swallow, gastrograffin should not be used as it can lead to pulmonary oedema if it enters the lungs. In such cases, low osmolar agents such as Gastromiro or Omnipaque should be used instead of Gastrograffin.",FALSE,"Tertiary contractions on gastrograffin swallow are the most likely early radiological finding in Boerhaave syndrome. This is because Boerhaave syndrome is a type of spontaneous esophageal rupture, and tertiary contractions are a sign of esophageal rupture on a gastrograffin swallow.

A 5 cm fat-dense lesion is also seen within the right kidney. Which of the following syndromes is the most accurate description of this clinical presentation? Select ONE answer only.,"SBA: Genito urinary, Adrenal, Obstetrics & Gynaecology and Breast",Wunderlich syndrome,Tuberous sclerosis,Tuberculosis,Paraneoplastic syndrome,Majewski Syndrome,A,70%,26%,1%,1%,3%,"Explanation:
Wunderlich syndrome
Spontaneous haemorrhage/rupture is a known complication of AMLs and is termed Wunderlich syndrome. Patients with AMLs larger than 4cm are at particularly increased risk of this. Wunderlich syndrome can occur in the context of Tuberous Sclerosis or in a patient with an isolated large AML. Although Wunderlich syndrome ismost commonly caused by an underlying AML, it can also be seen with renal cell carcinoma or vascular malformations.
Tuberous sclerosis
This condition would explain the presence of a fat containing renal lesion (AML) which is the underlying cause of the haematoma in this case, however it does not describe the main presentation of spontaneous haemorrhage. Not all patients with tuberous sclerosis have AMLs and not all of those with AMLs have large enough ones to rupture, and not all of those with large AMLs experience Wunderlich syndrome. In this question, arguably Tuberous Sclerosis is also a correct answer but in the setting of retroperitoneal haemorrhage, Wunderlich is a more correct/accurate answer.
Majewski Syndrome
This is a variant of short-rib polydactyly syndrome with no renal associations.",TRUE,"I chose 2 because Wunderlich Syndrome is a condition that is characterized by the sudden onset of right flank pain and bruising which occurs without any history of trauma.

Please note that the question asks for the LEAST likely finding.
Complications of asthma
There is little information to go on in the vignette. The question is primarily to do with the complications of asthma.
Air trapping is a well known phenomenon in asthma and is seen as flattening of the hemi diaphragms and hypertransradiancy.
Superadded infection can complicate any respiratory condition and asthma is no exception.
ABPA is a known complication of asthma
Pneumothoraces and pneumomediastinum can complicate asthma although the incidence is actually not vastly higher than that in the general population.
  Hypersensitivity pneumonitis classically mimics asthma on a chest radiograph. In a known asthmatic this would therefore be an unusual finding compared to the common complications listed above.",TRUE,"Hypersensitivity pneumonitis is an inflammatory lung condition that is caused by an allergic reaction to inhaled particles.

A Tarlov cyst
A tarlov cyst is the name given to dilatation of the posterior nerve root sheath. They follow CSF on all sequences and can cause significant bony scalloping.
  A synovial cyst – ‘Uncomplicated cystic formation connected to the facet joint containing synovial fluid’
Synovial cysts relate to the joint rather than the nerve. They tend to be seen in cases where the facet joints are already degenerate.
  Dural ectasia – ‘Ballooning of the dural sac resulting in posterior vertebral scalloping and herniation into the nerve root sleeves’
This is an interesting alternative diagnosis however usually occurs over more than one vertebral level. It can be associated with tarlov cysts.
  Nerve sheath tumour – ‘Hyperdense on CT causing vertebral body scalloping, dumbbell widening of the neural exit foramina’.  For example: a schwannoma.
  Meningocoele – ‘Neural tube defect with protrusion of membranes through bony defect in vertebral column’",TRUE,I chose this answer because it accurately describes a Tarlov cyst.

Select ONE answer only.,SBA: Musculoskeletal and Trauma,Omovertebral bone,VSD,Biliary atresia,Choanal atresia,Holt-Oram syndrome,A,78%,6%,2%,5%,9%,"Explanation:
Klippel-Feil syndrome
Klippel-Feil syndrome is predominantly a segmentation anomaly which arises during foetal development and leads to cervical fusion of two or more vertebral bodies. C2-3 are most commonly involved, accounting for around half of cases. Thereafter C5-6 accounts for a further third and the remainder are made up from fusions at other levels. There are a multitude of associated features, the predominant ones of which include:
GU abnormalities (of which a third have unilateral renal agenesis) (66%)
Scoliosis > 20 degrees (50%)
Sprengel shoulder (33%)
Deafness (sensorineural) (33%)
Cervial ribs (20%)
  Yet further features of this condition, all present in under 20% of cases include:
Odontoid dysplasia
Hemivertebrae / butterfly vertebrae
Syringomyelia / diastomatomyelia
Ear anomalies (microtia, deformed ossicles etc)
Congenital heart disease (ASD or coarctation)
  Sprengel shoulder
This condition can occur in isolation as well as part of Klippel-Feil syndrome. It is (like Klippel-Feil syndrome) also often associated with renal anomalies. Sprengel shoulder is a congenital abnormality where the scapula (usually, but not exclusively, unilateral) is attached to the cervical vertebra either by a fibrous or osseous connection, and therefore fails to descend into the normal position. The result is elevation and medial rotation of the scapula, which is usually hypoplastic. The condition can be readily appreciated on a plain film although cross-sectional imaging is useful to plan surgical correction if required. If present, the osseous connection between the scapula and the spine is termed an omovertebral bar.
Holt-Oram syndrome
This syndrome is associated with numerous skeletal and cardiac malformations. It is usually evident either antenatally or in the early neonatal period. Cardiac manifestations include either ASD or VSD, tetralogy of Fallot and coarctation. Perhaps most strikingly the condition is often associated with radial ray hypoplasia often meaning the absence of one or both thumbs. An x-ray may show absence or hypoplasia of one or both radii.",FALSE,"Holt-Oram syndrome is a genetic disorder that affects the development of the heart and arms. It is characterized by abnormalities of the upper limbs, including a small and elevated left scapula, fusion of the C5/6 vertebrae, and underdevelopment of the radius bone.

This is the classic description of a juvenile angiofibroma, if the demographic hasn’t already given the answer away. They are vascular tumours arising from the soft tissues in and around the sphenopalatine fossa, classically causing erosion of the medial pterygoid plate and interventionalists have a significant role to play in their management. Other testable points are that they are supplied by the internal maxillary artery, and are seen on MRI as flow voids on T2w.",FALSE,"I chose 4. Ethmoid sinus because epistaxis is a common symptom of a mass lesion in the ethmoid sinus. The ethmoid sinus is located between the eyes and the nasal cavity and is lined with mucous membranes.

This is the classical description of a plantar fibroma. On MRI they are characteristically iso/ slightly low in signal on both T1 and T2 weighted sequences compared with normal muscle signal, and show variable contrast enhancement.
A foreign body would be a small echogenic structure. Melanoma metastasis would be unlikely to cause a fusiform swelling and metastasis to the plantar fascia would be unlikely. Osteochondroma and osteophytes would also be hyperechoic due to the bone/ soft tissue interface.",TRUE,"Plantar fibromas are the most common cause of a painful palpable lump on the sole of the foot.

The assessment of peripheral zone and central zone lesions is very different in PIRADS assessment.
Peripheral zone
Dynamic contrast enhancement is used for assessment of peripheral zone lesions only - differentiating between PIRADS 3 and 4 lesions. The highest grade of suspicion for malignancy in the peripheral zone is indicated by the presence of restricted diffusion (focal high b-value and corresponding low ADC signal), with a PIRADS 5 lesion being one that is greater than 1.5 cm.
Transitional zone
The highest grade of suspicion for transitional zone lesions is reserved for moderate T2 lesion which is lenticular or non-circumscribed and moderately T2 hypointense (PIRADS 5 >1.5 cm).",FALSE,"The low b-value and corresponding high ADC signal are indicative of prostate malignancy in the transitional zone.

Select ONE answer only.",SBA: Gastrointestinal,Hepatitis B,Hepatitis A,Hepatitis C,Epstein-Barr Virus,Autoimmune hepatitis,A,49%,1%,47%,2%,1%,"Explanation:
Usually it is the development of cirrhosis from any cause, which predisposes patients to developing Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC).

The other conditions are far less commonly associated with the development of cirrhosis, tending to resolve or respond to therapy.",FALSE,"Hepatitis C is the most likely underlying liver condition in this case because it is a known risk factor for Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC). Intravenous drug abuse is a common way of contracting Hepatitis C, and it is the most common risk factor for HCC. Other potential causes of HCC, such as Hepatitis A, B, and Epstein-Barr Virus, are less likely in this case due to the patient's history of intravenous drug abuse.

Which of the following is a contraindication to performing intussusception reduction?,SBA: Paediatrics,Free abdominal gas on plain film,Severe contrast allergy,Lack of bowel vascularity on colour doppler,Intussusception length of greater than 3 cm,Symptom duration greater than 12 hours,A,93%,1%,4%,1%,1%,"Explanation:
Intussusception usually affects infants between the ages of 3 months and 3 years. The Ileocolic type is the most common, followed by ileo-ileocolic. It is important to consider lead points: HSP, Meckel’s diverticulum and duplication cysts are all possibilities.
Another important facet to this condition is the management of intussusception. Reduction using a fluoroscopic-guided air enema (rather than barium) reduces the risk of faecal peritonitis and is the preferred management. The risk of perforation with this method is thought to be around 0.5%. Free air on plain film and clinical peritonitis are contraindications to pneumatic reduction by air enema.
Although long intussusceptions, lack of bowel wall vascularity and an extended duration of symptoms are not favourable features (being associated with greater complication rates and poorer success rates of pneumatic reduction), they are not contra-indications; perforation is the only absolute contraindication here.",FALSE,"I chose 5. Symptom duration greater than 12 hours because intussusception reduction is contraindicated if the duration of the symptoms is greater than 12 hours, as the risk of ischemia and necrosis increases with time.

Most are adrenal in location, around a third develop in the retroperitoneum and a fifth are located in the posterior mediastinum. Presentation can be with abdominal pain, a mass, or a fever. Most (95%) secrete catecholamines such as VMA (vanillylmandelic acid – leads to hypertension) or VIP (vasoactive intestinal polypeptides – leads to watery diarrhoea). There are also a few distinct clinical syndromes which herald the presence of a neuroblastoma.
  Syndrome
Details
Blueberry muffin syndrome
Metastatic cutaneous deposits
Opsomyoclonus
Rapid jerky eye movements and myoclonic jerks of the legs. This occurs in around 2% of neuroblastoma cases but around 50% of patients with opsomyoclonus have a neuroblastoma.
Hutchinson syndrome
Limping due to bony metastases
  On imaging they appear as a very large abdominal mass with or without speckled calcification within in. The kidney can either be invaded or just displaced inferiorly, causing a ‘drooping lily’ appearance on urography (where contrast within the inferiorly displaced renal calyces has the appearance of a lily flower with its head hanging down). Neuroblastomas tend to encase large vessels such as the IVC, as opposed to displacing them as Wilms tumours are prone to doing. Staging is performed with an 123I-MIBG scan (as opposed to a 99mTc-MDP bone scan) and importantly within the staging it is actually stage IVs (disease involving the skin, bone marrow and liver) which has the best prognosis.
  Rhabdomyosarcoma
These aggressive lesions are the most common pelvic tumour for children under the age of 15 although they can be found anywhere in the body. Although histologically they are formed of skeletal muscle derivation, they do not have to be in continuity with normal skeletal muscle. They tend to appear low in reflectivity on ultrasound. On MRI they follow muscle on T1 weighted sequences, but enhance avidly with gadolinium.  They usually show invasive features and have a high propensity for metastatic spread.
  Burkitt lymphoma
The non-endemic form of Burkitt lymphoma comprises around a third of paediatric non-Hodgkin lymphoma cases. Most cases present as an abdominal mass or bowel obstruction due to the attachment of the mass to bowe. Owing to a rapid doubling time the original mass can be extremely large at the time of diagnosis. Often nodal disease is notably absent.
  Mature teratoma
Teratomas and dermoid cysts have very similar imaging characteristics despite their histological differences. Teratomas are are slow growing and usually benign. By contrast immature teratomas are malignant. The presence of fat is a strong indicator for a mature teratoma with the combination of fat, fluid and calcification being highly specific. On MRI the fat will show the usual signal dropout on gradient echo sequences. Calcification will show as low signal on T2. Malignant degeneration if it does occur, is to squamous cell carcinoma most commonly.",TRUE,"Wilms tumour is the most likely diagnosis because it is the most common malignant abdominal tumour in children and the ultrasound scan findings are consistent with this diagnosis.

Tuberculous spondylitis also known as Pott disease
Around half of patients have no pulmonary disease and spondylitis accounts for around 5% of all infections with tuberculosis. The L1 vertebral body is the most commonly affected level but usually more than one levels is affected. Within the vertebral body it is the anterior aspect which is affected first. This is thought to be due to the subligamentous spread of the bacterium, under the anterior longitudinal ligament. The disc height is usually preserved until relatively late on in the disease which can make the condition very difficult to detect on x-ray since neither periosteal reactions nor reactive sclerosis are likely to be seen either. Calcification to the disc is common though, and virtually pathognomonic when present.
  Phemister triad
Of articular tuberculosis it is the spine which is most commonly affected however the hips and knees can also be affected. The Phemister triad describes three classical features of tuberculous arthropathy which are common to all the joints affected:
Juxta-articular osteoporosis
Marginal erosions
Gradual reduction of the joint space
Differentiating tuberculous spondylitis from pyogenic spondylitis is crucial and there are a number of features which can help.

14388,207854,You are reviewing the chest radiograph of a baby boy born recently. He has developed hypoxia and required admission to the neonatal unit. Which of the following diagnoses is correctly associated with the likely findings on x-ray? Select ONE answer only.,SBA: Paediatrics,"Meconium aspiration - coarse lung markings, hyperinflation","Hyaline membrane disease - granular, hyperinflated lungs",Transient tachypnoea of the newborn - deep sulcus sign,"Neonatal pneumonia - prominent hila markings, effusions",Pneumothorax - regional air space opacification,A,72%,15%,3%,10%,1%,"Explanation:
Neonatal Respiratory Distress © Medical Exam Prep
    Of the five main respiratory conditions of the neonate the differential diagnosis can be narrowed based on gestational age. The presence of hyperinflation can also be useful but may not always be present where feasible so should not be used as an absolute discriminator. If present, it is useful.
  Meconium aspiration
Meconium is sticky and causes a chemical pneumonitis in the lungs, seen as patchy consolidation. In addition, small globules of meconium entering bronchi and bronchioles of a decreasing calibre act as a ball-valve mechanism and lead to air trapping; thus the lung volumes of a baby with meconium aspiration may be increased. Air bronchograms are notably absent. The typical baby in a meconium aspiration situation is post-term.
  Transient tachypnoea of the newborn (TTN)
The classical patient for TTN would be a term baby born by caesarean section to a diabetic mother. During normal vaginal delivery the compression of the baby as it descends the birth canal acts to squeeze fluid out from its lungs. This mechanism is all but absent during a caesarean section. Consequently, these babies are born with an excess of retained fluid. The CXR of an affected baby will show bilateral symmetrical air space opacification with air bronchograms, fluid in the fissures and pleural effusions. This peaks in severity at 24hrs but resolves by three days.
  Hyaline Membrane Disease (HMD) also known as surfactant deficient disease (SDD)
It is to reduce the likelihood of this disease developing that a woman in pre-term labour will be offered a steroid injection. The steroids help the neonatal lungs to develop faster and increase the likelihood of their being able to produce surfactant once delivered. Where there is surfactant deficiency the alveoli collapse. The CXR will show a granular opacification throughout both lungs which progresses to bilateral ground glass opacification with air bronchograms. If exogenous surfactant is given to the baby there may be asymmetrical improvement in the appearances depending on how much reaches each lung. Of note HMD does not cause pleural effusions. Finally a normal CXR at 6hrs post delivery excludes HMD.
  Neonatal pneumothorax
Usually chest radiographs are performed with the baby lying down. The free gas in the pneumothorax rises to the superior part of the baby and therefore the classical apical contour seen in adult pneumothoraces, is lost. Instead unilateral hyperlucency may be seen and any pleural line should be regarded with extreme suspicion. A deep sulcus sign occurs when the gas collects at the anteroinferior aspect of the thoracic cavity, outlining the costophrenic angle sharply at its most inferior extent. The morbidity and mortality relating to undiagnosed neonatal pneumothorax is such that if there is any doubt further views such as a cross table lateral or a lateral decubitus view should be performed without delay.",FALSE,"I chose this answer because neonatal pneumonia is the most likely diagnosis for a baby with hypoxia who has been admitted to the neonatal unit. On the chest radiograph, the findings of neonatal pneumonia would include prominent hila markings, which are enlarged lymph nodes, and effusions, which are fluid-filled spaces in the lungs. These findings are consistent with a diagnosis of neonatal pneumonia.",2,"2. A question about clinical judgement, what is the correct diagnosis?",B,FALSE,,B,FALSE,C

The arterial supply to duodenum is from the pancreaticoduodenal arteries.
The superior pancreaticoduodenal artery is a branch of the gastroduodenal artery (which in turn arises from the common hepatic artery of the coeliac trunk). It supplies the duodenum proximal to the entry of the bile duct (i.e. the section derived from the embryonic foregut).
The inferior pancreaticoduodenal artery is a branch of the superior mesenteric artery (which arises from the anterior surface of the aorta). It supplies the duodenum distal to the entry of the bile duct (i.e. the part derived from the embryonic midgut).
  The branches of the coeliac trunk showing the pancreaticoduodenal arteries (from Gray’s Anatomy)
 ",FALSE,"I chose number 2, Superior mesenteric artery, because it is the most common source of the superior pancreaticoduodenal artery.

13783,207854,A 56-year-old office clerk presents with pains in both knees. There is no history of trauma. X-rays show bilateral sclerotic foci on both sides of the knee joint. On direct questioning he has also noticed symptoms of polyuria and polydipsia in the last few months. What is the most likely diagnosis?,SBA: Musculoskeletal and Trauma,Erdheim Chester disease,Renal cell carcinoma metastases,Paget disease,Mastocytosis,Malignant melanoma metastases,A,69%,5%,6%,18%,2%,"Explanation:
Erdheim-Chester disease
Infiltration of the appendicular skeleton by histiocytes leads to fibrosis and sclerosis which can appear striking on an x-ray. The condition is very similar to Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis (LCH) and both conditions have been reported across a broad range of patient ages. Usually however LCH presents at around the age of 5-10 whereas ECD peaks in incidence at around 55 years of age. Both diseases are caused by clonal proliferations of one or more lines of histiocytes and there are different cellular markers which can help distinguish between the two diseases pathologically. There is considerable overlap in the clinical and radiological features of both diseases.
Clinically patients with ECD present with all or any of the usual histiocytosis triad of diabetes insipidus, exophthalmos and bone pain. Of these, the most prominent feature is usually bony pain.
X-rays show sclerosis in the metadiaphyseal regions in a bilateral symmetrical pattern but with sparing of the epiphyses. Corticomedullary differentiation becomes blurred and there are also multiple areas of lucency indicating the presence of lytic lesions too.
  Mastocytosis
This disease is also caused by clonal proliferation of a particular cell type however in this case it is of mast cells. Clinically patients may experience symptoms linked to histamine release from the mast cells such as flushing, sweating, diarrhoea and abdominal pains but only around a quarter of patients complain of bony pains. The skeleton can be affected by either focal lesions (usually in the spine) or with diffusely increased density. Other features such as hepatosplenomegaly, and lymph node enlargement (retroperitoneal, mesenteric, periportal) may be present too.
  Metastases
Sclerotic metastases are typical with prostate and breast cancers among others. This should always be considered as a pertinent differential diagnosis however there are not other features in this question to suggest it is correct in this case.
Sclerotic metastases:
Prostate (most common)
Breast (mixed lytic and sclerotic)
Transitional Cell Carcinoma
Lymphoma
Mucinous adenocarcinomas (colon, gastric, ovary)
Medulloblastoma
Neuroblastoma
Carcinoid
  Paget disease
Paget disease is seldom found in patients below the age of 50 but is one of the more common musculoskeletal abnormalities thereafter. It consists of polyostotic, asymmetric disordered bone remodelling where intensive osteoclastic activity leads to multiple lytic lesions before osteoblastic activity results in the formation of sclerotic bone. A variety of imaging findings can be seen with x-ray. 
Lytic phase: During the lytic phase, radiolucency with a ‘flame’ or ‘blade of grass’ shape extends along the diaphysis and osteoporosis circumscripta (large lucent areas of skull) can be found in the skull.
Mixed phase: lytic and sclerotic phenomena
Sclerotic phase: densely sclerotic bone such as the classical ‘ivory vertebra’ can be found.
  Clinically it can be an incidental asymptomatic diagnosis or can present as all or any of:
Elevated ALP with a normal calcium and phosphate
A pathological fracture – although it may be sclerotic, the bone structure is disordered and therefore weaker than normal bone.
Cranial nerve palsies – due to compression at neural foramina
Enlarging head / hat size – due to widening of the diploic spaces (referred to as the Tam O’Shanter sign, whereby the skull takes on the appearance of a the Scottish hat called the Tam O’Shanter)
High output cardiac failure – this is a rare presentation caused by markedly increased bony perfusion
Pain – in the absence of a fracture, it is usually not a painful condition per se but can co-exist with other conditions such as osteoarthritis which may be the cause of the patient’s pain
Radiologically the hallmarks are bony expansion with coarsening of the trabeculae and cortices. On a bone scan active lesions will show increased uptake due to their increased blood flow.
Sarcomatous degeneration of the affected sites into either an osteosarcoma, malignant fibrous histiocytoma or chondrosarcoma carries a poor prognosis and careful study should be made of any known lesions at each imaging opportunity. New soft tissue component formation or new lysis of previously sclerotic bone should raise suspicion.",FALSE,Paget disease is a chronic metabolic bone disorder characterized by abnormal bone formation. It is associated with sclerotic foci on X-rays and is a common cause of knee pain in older adults. It can also cause symptoms of polyuria and polydipsia due to its association with hyperparathyroidism.,2,,C,FALSE,,C,FALSE,E

What is the most likely pathology?,SBA: Central Nervous and Head & Neck,Berry aneurysm at PCA,Orbital myositis,Temporal arteritis with cranial nerve IV palsy,Bell palsy,Orbital foreign body,A,78%,10%,8%,4%,0%,"Explanation:
There is an association between adult polycystic kidney disease (APCKD) and berry aneurysms.
The third cranial nerve runs parallel to the posterior communicating artery and dives under the posterior cerebral artery. The association between PCOM or PCA pathology and third nerve palsy signs is a classical one from an exam perspective. Painful ptosis – think PCOM or PCA aneurysm. It will be an ipsilateral pathology because the Oculomotor nerve is post-ganglionic at this point.
Involvement of the pupil also suggests an aneurysm as the pupil is spared in ischaemic third nerve palsies.
Orbital myositis would cause a swollen levator palpebrae.
The fourth cranial nerve supplies superior oblique and would cause diplopia on downward gaze.
A Bell palsy is usually not painful.",FALSE,"Bell palsy is the most likely pathology in this case because it is the most common cause of unilateral facial paralysis and ptosis. Bell palsy is caused by a viral infection that affects the facial nerve, resulting in paralysis of the muscles on one side of the face. Additionally, a dilated pupil is a common symptom of Bell palsy.",2,,D,FALSE,,C,FALSE,C
9336,207854,"A 66-year-old man presents to A+E with severe acute abdominal pains. He is well known to your hospital with a history of both atrial fibrillation and ischaemic heart disease. On examination he has diffuse abdominal tenderness but is not peritonitic. Blood tests performed in A+E show elevated inflammatory markers and a metabolic acidosis with a very high lactate. He undergoes a CT scan which shows thumbprinting of the descending colon with mucosal oedema. The caecum, small bowel and rectum appear normal. Which of the following is the most likely explanation for these findings?",SBA: Gastrointestinal,Inferior mesenteric artery thrombus,Superior mesenteric artery thrombus,Coeliac axis stricture,Hypotension,Internal iliac artery stricture,A,85%,6%,1%,9%,0%,"Explanation:
Ischaemic colitis
Anything that compromises the vascular supply to the bowl can cause ischaemic colitis. This can be a thrombus, mechanical strangulation or a prolonged period of hypotension (most commonly encountered in the setting of an ITU patient). Mucosal hyperenhancement can be seen on CT as a consequence of increased permeability in the setting of a shocked bowel (other signs of shock include hyperenhancement of the adrenal glands and a slit like configuration to the inferior vena cava). Mucosal necrosis leads to oedema and haemorrhage with sloughing as the dead layer of cells falls away. Necrosis of the submucosal and muscularis layers leads to stricturing. Thumbprinting is a term derived from the appearances of a non-specifically oedematous bowel on a barium study. The same appearance on CT is less suggestive of the classic thumbprint indentations seen on fluoroscopy but the term is still used. Loss of integrity of the mucosa allows gas to enter the mesenteric vessels and thereby the portal venous system. Gas in the periphery of the liver is suggestive of portal venous gas (as opposed to aerobilia) and is a late sign of ischaemic bowel associated with a poor outcome.
The involvement of different areas of the bowel can give a clue as to the affected vessel. The watershed areas are those at the very fringes of supply from the different mesenteric arteries and are the first to be affected in low flow states.
Vascular territories
Watershed areas (splenic flexure and rectosigmoid junction) or the whole bowel
Hypoperfusion states
Caecum to splenic flexure
SMA

IMA",TRUE,"I chose number 5: Inferior Mesenteric Artery Thrombus. The CT scan findings of thumbprinting of the descending colon with mucosal oedema are consistent with a diagnosis of mesenteric ischemia, which is most commonly caused by an inferior mesenteric artery thrombus.

What should you advise next?,"SBA: Genito urinary, Adrenal, Obstetrics & Gynaecology and Breast",Technetium-99m MAG3,Technetium-99m DMSA,Technetium-99m DTPA,Iodine-123 MIBG,Iodine-131 OIH,A,70%,11%,17%,1%,1%,"Explanation:
Nuclear medicine was an extremely useful tool prior to the advent of cross sectional imaging and it is still very important for use as a problem solving tool in many cases. The key feature of nuclear medicine tests is that they are functional. In this case, in all likelihood, the patient would have received a CT KUB which would have shown a ureteric calculus. However, in patients where even a CT KUB fails to identify the cause of an apparent obstruction it is important to determine if the hydronephrosis and hydroureter really are related to an obstruction and not a feature of long-standing reflux, for example. Given the clinical scenario provided it would not be unreasonable to conclude that the patient is obstructed on the left side, and a MAG3 will be able to confirm this.
  MAG3
Dynamic scan. Images every 2 mins for approximately 20 mins.
MAG3 is a compound which has a high renal extraction rate and can be labelled with Tc99m. It provides an overview of the renal plasma flow. A normal unobstructed kidney shows an initial increase in activity over 2 minutes as the tracer reaches the kidney followed by a slow decline in activity over around 20 minutes as it is filtered. An obstructed system will show a similar initial increase but activity will then not decline. Furosemide can be given to maximise the opportunity to show flow distal to the kidney. MAG3 is a safe agent to use in patients with renal failure.
  Captopril (an ACEi) can be given to diagnose renal artery stenosis as a cause of hypertension since the activity in a patient with renal artery stenosis will decline following administration of Captopril whereas a normal kidney will retain activity.
  Post-micturition images at 20 minutes can help to show the presence of residual bladder volume.
  OIH (Hippuran) - this has largely been replaced by MAG3
  DTPA – differential agent
Dynamic scan. Images at 1.5 second intervals for the first 30 seconds then less at 5 min intervals for 30 mins.
Since DTPA is cleared only via the glomeruli it can be used to measure GFR. In a normal kidney the activity level peaks sharply followed by a decline which is initially rapid and then tapers off. As GFR worsens firstly the initial rapid decline becomes more gradual and with increasingly poor disease the initial peak then becomes diminished too. Ironically for a study used to measure GFR, DTPA is not a good agent for patients with renal failure; it can only be cleared via the glomeruli therefore if there is no glomerular filtration the agent will persist and lead to a high dose. Studies need higher doses than MAG3.
  DMSA – morphology and structure
Static scan. Image once at 2 hours.
DMSA is an excellent agent for evaluating the renal cortex. It is used a lot in the paediatric setting in the investigation of scars following pyelonephritis.
  MIBG scanning (I123-Metaiodobenzylguanidine)
This comes under the broader heading of a guanethidine analogue and can be used to pinpoint catecholamine producing tumours such as phaeochromocytomas or other paragangliomas. The scan can be used to locate an extra-adrenal phaeochromocytoma. The tracer is also taken up by neuroblastomas, carcinoid tumours and medullary carcinoma of the thyroid.
If the CT scan shows morphologically normal adrenal glands then an MRI scan is unlikely to be of any further benefit. A dedicated MRI scan of the adrenal glands with in and out of phase sequences might be useful in the setting of an indeterminate mass; if there is signal dropout within the mass it is likely to be an adenoma.
An adrenal biopsy should 'never' be performed for a suspected phaeochromocytoma. The risk is of provoking catecholamine release and triggering extreme hypertension or a cardiac arrhythmia.",FALSE,"Technetium-99m DMSA is the imaging test of choice for evaluating hydronephrosis and hydroureter. It is a non-invasive imaging test that can be used to determine the cause of the patient's condition, such as a blockage, an obstruction, or a congenital anomaly. It can also be used to monitor the effectiveness of treatment.",2,"3. A question about clinical management, what is the best course of action?

14291,207854,A 64-year-old man is brought to the Emergency Department by his worried wife after becoming unwell at home. He has neurological signs and an MRI spine is requested which shows abnormalities within the spinal cord. You suspect he may have multiple sclerosis. Which of the following is LEAST consistent with multiple sclerosis? Select ONE answer only.,SBA: Central Nervous and Head & Neck,Grey matter spared,Cord expansion,High T2 signal affecting 1-2 vertebral levels,Intracranial lesions,Cervical cord affected,B,19%,72%,6%,1%,1%,"Explanation:
Please note that the question asks which answer is LEAST consistent with multiple sclerosis.
  Demyelination
Demyelination can occur due to multiple sclerosis, ADEM or as an idiopathic process.
Acute idiopathic transverse myelitis is a specific diagnosis of exclusion. There is inflammation of the spinal cord leading to bilateral motor, sensory and autonomic dysfunction. On imaging there is expansion of the central portion of the cord extending over multiple vertebral levels. The inflamed portion returns high signal on T2 weighted sequences. This occurs most commonly in the thoracic spine and importantly, should involve at least two thirds of the cross-sectional area of the cord at the affected level. This is in contrast to a multiple sclerosis plaque which involves under half of the cross-sectional area of the cord.
Multiple sclerosis can affect the spinal cord. Lesions tend to be smaller usually confined to 1-2 vertebral levels and affecting less than half of the cross-sectional area of the cord. There may be mild focal expansion of the cord, but this is a far less prominent feature than it is with idiopathic transverse myelitis. 90% of patients will have other intracranial lesions. The lesions of MS also return high T2 signal, like their intracranial counterparts. The cervical cord is most commonly affected. Gray matter can be affected but it is white matter plaques which are by far the dominant feature, thus 'sparing' of the gray matter is often used to distinguish MS from ADEM.
ADEM (acute disseminated encephalomyelitis) is an autoimmune condition which occurs days-weeks following a viral infection. It largely affects the white matter of the brain, but the spinal cord can also be affected. Gray matter, particularly the basal ganglia are also often involved. It can occur at any age, but it is usually young children who are affected. Patients usually respond very well to steroid therapy and fortunately, most (90%) cases resolve without any residual deficit. On imaging, the affected areas return high T2 signal.",FALSE,I chose this answer because high T2 signal affecting 1-2 vertebral levels is not consistent with multiple sclerosis. Multiple sclerosis is typically associated with lesions that involve multiple vertebral levels and parts of the brain and spinal cord.,2,"This question falls under category 2: A question about clinical judgement, what is the correct diagnosis?",C,TRUE,,B,TRUE,A

A mass is seen on his CXR so he undergoes a CT chest which shows a well-demarcated pleural based lesion of 5cm which enhances avidly with contrast. No effusions or lymph node enlargement is seen. What is the most likely diagnosis?,SBA: Cardiothoracic and vascular,Pleural fibroma,Malignant mesothelioma,Sarcoidosis,Brown tumour,Acromegaly,A,71%,16%,2%,9%,2%,"Explanation:
Pleural fibroma 
Pleural fibromas are benign fibrous tumours. Unlike their malignant counterpart, the malignant mesothelioma, pleural fibromas do not have an association with prior asbestos exposure. Pleural fibromas tend to be asymptomatic unless large and causing symptoms related to mass effect. There is however a reasonably strong association with hypertrophic pulmonary osteoarthropathy. 
On CT the tumours are smooth with contrast enhancement. If seen on a CXR, the presence of an obtuse angle between the bulk of the mass and the chest wall strongly suggests a pleural mass (as opposed to a parenchymal one). Some fibromas can be pedunculated. The presence of haemorrhage or necrosis raises the suspicion of malignancy and although these tumours themselves are benign, around a third of them undergo malignant transformation. Surgical excision, therefore, is the usual management approach.
  Hypertrophic pulmonary osteoarthropathy (HPOA)
In essence this is a paraneoplastic phenomenon although it can be found in many non-neoplastic circumstances. Subperiosteal new bone formation is seen as a lamellar periosteal reaction on imaging. HPOA is usually described in the distal phalanges in association with clubbing but does also occur in the rest of the appendicular skeleton. Clinically the patients experience a burning pain with swelling and stiffness of any of the affected joints.
HPOA can be caused by the presence of a bronchogenic carcinoma: this is a common scenario of medical school finals exams. Pleural fibromas are also a known cause. Extra-pulmonary causes are less common but do happen.",FALSE,"Malignant mesothelioma is the most likely diagnosis in this case due to the patient's age and the presence of a pleural based lesion that is well-demarcated and enhances avidly with contrast. This is classic for malignant mesothelioma, which is most commonly seen in people who have been exposed to asbestos. Sarcoidosis, brown tumour, pleural fibroma, and acromegaly are not typically associated with this presentation.",2,,B,TRUE,,A,TRUE,A

This question is to do with the imaging characteristics of blood within the brain. We can think of the intracranial space as a closed box as far as oxygen tensions go which means that blood degrades in a predictable fashion and therefore has predictable appearances on T1 and T2 according to the changes in the haemoglobin molecule. There are a few different methods to help remember the changes in appearance, one of which is the table below:

  In real life and for the 2b exam the important distinction is around the subacute stages.
In that case, by and large, if it is bright on T1 it is subacute and T2 then decides if it is early or late subacute. The timeframes given are also important and can form the basis of 2a exam questions.
  Of the other answers provided therefore:
Bright on T1 and dark on T2 = Early subacute
Dark on T1 and bright on T2 = Chronic
Dark on T1 and dark on T2 = Acute
Isointense on T1 and bright on T2 = Hyperacute",FALSE,"The correct answer is 2. Dark on T1 and bright on T2. This is because subarachnoid hemorrhages usually appear as dark on T1-weighted images and bright on T2-weighted images due to the high protein content of the blood.

Pleomorphic adenoma is the 80% condition. 80% are in found in the parotid gland, 80% of those are in the superficial lobe. Overall 80% are benign. They are slow growing and usually present as a painless lump. They show low T1 signal and high T2 signal on MRI – think of them as cystic in this regard although their mucoid matrix can give rise to hyperintense areas centrally.
A Warthin tumour is a differential diagnosis for a painless parotid lump but has an association with smokers. Different sources describe different imaging characteristics. A Warthin tumour usually presents as bilateral asymptomatic masses or possibly multiple unilateral masses.

Amiodarone therapy
Amiodarone is an anti-arrhythmic drug which contains iodine (am-IOD-arone). Consequently, as it accumulates in the liver, it can cause significant increase in density to the liver on a CT scan.

On an HRCT scan ground glass opacities, reticulations and areas of consolidation can be seen.

Please note that the question asks which feature is NOT consistent with the diagnosis.
Multilocular cystic nephroma
There were previuosly thought to be two age peaks for this tumour; one at around age 4 which affects mostly boys and one at around age 40 which affects mostly women however more recently immunohistochemical and genetic differences between the tumours affecting each age group have been uncovered. Nevertheless, the radiological features of the two tumour types remain similar. In young boys the most common presentation is of a painless abdominal mass with or without other features such as haematuria and urinary tract infections. On ultrasound there will be a mass of cysts but importantly they will be surrounded by a thick fibrous capsule. Protrusion into the renal pelvis is also a key finding, but this is also seen in some Wilms tumours. There shouldn't be a solid component to this mass but enhancement of the septae separating the cysts may be seen on cross-sectional imaging.

Which of the following would best fit with these findings?,SBA: Gastrointestinal,Mastocytosis,Scleroderma,Coeliac disease,Lymphoma,Eosinophilic enteropathy,A,76%,6%,8%,5%,5%,"Explanation:
Fold thickness
Much is made on barium examinations, of the thickness of the folds and whether there is any nodularity. Such features can be helpful in teasing apart the possible diagnoses in similar cases.
Coeliac disease – dilatation without increase in fold thickness
Scleroderma – dilatation without loss of valvulae conniventes, prolonged transit time
Zollinger-Ellison syndrome – dilatation of the proximal small bowel due to hypersecretion
Small bowel lymphoma – fold thickening and lymph node enlargement
Mastocytosis – nodular fold thickening with sclerotic bone lesions
Crohn disease – nodular fold thickening
Whipple disease – thickened folds (+/- microndularity) without dilatation, with normal transit time
  Mastocytosis
Mast cells store histamine (among other things). Where they exist in excess the resultant symptoms fit with excess histamine release. Patients complain of nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, hypotension, flushing and abdominal pain. Asthma-type symptoms can also occur. On imaging hepatosplenomegaly and lymph node enlargement are common. The walls of the small bowel become thickened and malabsorption occurs too. Mastocytosis is also a cause of bony sclerosis.

  Eosinophilic enteropathy
This is a rare condition caused by infiltration of eosinophils into the wall of the small bowel. Patients often suffer from food allergies and experience multiple attacks of abdominal pain, diarrhoea and vomiting in a relapsing/remitting pattern. Blood eosinophil levels are usually raised. On imaging the folds of the small bowel can appear thickened.
Differential diagnosis for lymph nodes of low attenuation
Coeliac disease – cavitating mesenteric lymph node syndrome
Tuberculosis
Whipple disease
Lymphoma
Necrotic metastases
  Coeliac disease
Luminal sensitivity to gluten leads to autoimmune mediated atrophy of villi within the small bowel. Iron deficiency anaemia, malabsorption and deficiency of the fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E and K) result. Classically on imaging there is jejunisation of the ileum (ie an increased number of ileal folds and a decreased number of jejunal folds) which is a reasonably specific sign to coeliac disease. Importantly however the fold thickness is not increased, in contrast to many of the possible differential diagnoses. On historic fluoroscopic examinations flocculation, segmentation are supposed to be typical and result from hypersecretion of fluid however modern barium preparations are less susceptible to these effects. The moulage sign (complete loss of jejunal folds such that the bowel wall appears smooth) is also quoted. A rare complication is cavitating mesenteric lymph node syndrome where lymph nodes within the small bowel mesentry show low attenuation on CT and characteristically have fat-fluid levels. In such cases the spleen may also be atrophic.
  Scleroderma
Scleroderma is a multi-system connective tissue disease leading to fibrosis and loss of smooth muscle. In the gastrointestinal system this leads to the hidebound sign (similar but different to stacked coin sign which is seen in intramural haematoma where the folds are thickened) where, despite being dilated in calibre, the small bowel still retains the valvulae conniventes which would otherwise be effaced. This is thought to result from fibrosis of the longitudinal layer causing foreshortening along the long axis. In the small bowel there can also be the formation of square-shaped broad-based sacculations (true-diverticulae because they involve all layers of the bowel wall) on the mesenteric border of the bowel is seen owing to uneven atrophy of the smooth muscle there. A prolonged transit time would be ususal. Pseudosacculations (wide-mouthed diverticulae) are found in the colon but this time on the antimesenteric border. (The *only* anti-mesenteric diverticulum of the small bowel is a Meckel's diverticulum.)
  Small bowel lymphoma
Malignancies of the small bowel are rare but lymphoma is the most common of these. Coeliac disease, infection with H. Pylori and AIDs both predispose patients to developing small bowel lymphoma. Perhaps surprisingly patients do not present with obstruction even when the tumour burden is large, similarly neoplastic perforation is not common. Instead patients present with insidious symptoms or haemorrhage. On imaging there is (sometimes extensive) thickening of the bowel wall, often with associated lymph node enlargement.",FALSE,"Coeliac disease is the best fit with these findings because it is a condition caused by an autoimmune reaction to gluten, which results in damage to the small intestine. This damage can cause thickening of the jejunal folds and fine micronodularity, as well as sclerotic bony lesions on the control film.",2,,C,FALSE,,D,FALSE,B

Please note that the question asks which answer would NOT support the diagnosis.
Mesoblastic nephroma
This is the most common solid mass in a neonate and 90% of them are diagnosed within the first year of life. Presentation is usually as an abdominal mass. On ultrasound there will be a large hypoechoic renal mass which cannot clearly be separated from the normal renal parenchyma. Cystic spaces can be present due to necrosis. Pertinent negative imaging features of note are the lack of invasion into the collecting system and lack of venous invasion, the latter in particular helps to differentiate it from a Wilms tumour. Both mesoblastic nephroma and nephroblastomatosis show less enhancement post-contrast than the adjacent normal renal parenchyma. Nephroblastomatosis consists of cystic spaces whereas a mesoblastic nephroma is a solid mass which may or may not have cystic spaces.

10876,230652,A 55-year-old female patient with a heavy smoking history is found to have numerous cystic lung lesions in the upper lobes. The lung volumes are preserved. What is the most likely diagnosis?,SBA: Cardiothoracic and vascular,Histiocytosis,Lymphangioleiomyomatosis,Emphysema,Neurofibromatosis,RBILD,A,48%,20%,15%,1%,16%,"Explanation:
Histiocytosis (also known as Langerhans cell histiocytosis - LCH)
There are three separate forms of this disease:
Eosinophilic granuloma (70%) – a limited version confined to the skeleton in children or young adults. Clinically presents as fever, raised WCC and ESR with painful bony lesions. In the skull these have a typical ‘beveled edge’ or ‘hole within a hole’ appearance or can be seen as a ‘button sequestrum’. In the spine it is one of the main causes of vertebra plana.
Hand-Schüller-Christian Disease (20%) – classically a triad of destructive bony lesions, diabetes insipidus and exophthalmos. In a quarter of these patients the lungs are involved with cyst formation and spontaneous pneumothoraces possible. Nodule formation, fibrosis and honeycombing is also seen.
Letterer-Siwe Disease (10%) – a fulminant multi-organ variant affecting very young infants
  There is a strong association with smoking for patients who develop pulmonary features of LCH. Heavy smoking causes an accumulation of Langerhans cells and hence, as with other inspiration-related lung diseases, there is a predilection for the upper zones. The Langerhans cells can collect with other cells and become small granulomas seen as small lung nodules. Despite being a type of fibrotic lung disease the lung volumes can be increased (if not normal). Small lung cysts form and there is a risk of spontaneous pneumothorax. There is usually sparing of the costophrenic angles which can be a key finding..
  Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM)
LAM can go misdiagnosed for many years as emphysema. It occurs exclusively in non-smoking women of childbearing age and quite often a history of spontaneous pneumothorax is given. Radiologically there are numerous small cystic spaces surrounded by normal lung. Nodule formation is not a typical feature, neither is bronchial wall thickening. A chylous pleural effusion (negative Hounsfield units) is reasonably specific. The main differential diagnosis would be histiocytosis which tends to be associated with smoking, classically spares the costophrenic angles and gives small nodules but both can present with spontaneous pneumothorax and give small cysts. The lung volumes in LAM will remain normal whereas they can be increased in Histiocytosis (surprisingly for a fibrotic lung disease).
  Emphysema
Many cystic lung diseases are often misdiagnosed initially as emphysema, largely due to the population prevalence of emphysema. Common things are common.
True lung cysts however have a perceptible wall whereas emphysematous spaces within lung tissue does not.
  Centrilobular emphysema – Caused by smoking. enlargement of the respiratory bronchiole, destruction of the alveolar septa, surrounded by normal lung, distal alveoli are spared. Affects the apical segments of each lobe due to higher ventilation perfusion ratios.
Panacinar emphysema – Caused by alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency. Affects the whole lung with greater severity seen at the bases where there is greater blood flow. Uniform lung destruction.
Paraseptal emphysema – characteristically subpleural. Associated with bullous formation and spontaneous pneumothorax.
  Respiratory Bronchiolitis Interstitial Lung disease (RBILD)
This condition is heavily associated with smoking and can be seen as centrilobular nodules with ground glass opacification – in an exam question setting therefore, look for this trio of findings (heavy smoking + ground glass opacification + centrilobular nodules). Appearances are often very similar to desquamative interstitial pneumonia. Patients can be relatively young.
  Neurofibromatosis
Technically neurofibromatosis (type I) is included in the differential diagnosis for lung cysts (particularly when apical) however the rest of the information provided is insufficient to make this the most likely answer here.",FALSE,"I chose this answer because Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) is a rare lung disease that primarily affects women of childbearing age and is characterized by cystic lung lesions in the upper lobes, as well as preserved lung volumes.

Exam questions are often frustrating in that they withhold information that would be readily available to you if you were viewing the scan yourself. For example, if viewing the CT of this abnormality, you would readily assess for the venous drainage pathway which would solve the dilemma.
The answer is extralobar pulmonary sequestration. The presentation for intralobar sequestration is usually in an older child who gets recurrent infections. Extralobar pulmonary sequestration is often seen in neonates and is associated with congenital heart disease. Congenital Lobar Overinflation (CLO - Previously called Congenital Lobar Emphysema) usually affects the upper lobe and would not have systemic arterial supply. Neither would Congenital Cystic Adenomatoid Malformation (CCAM).

Which SINGLE statement regarding the aorta is true?",SBA: Cardiothoracic and vascular,It runs through a common pericardial sheath with the pulmonary trunk,The posterior aortic sinus gives rise to the right coronary artery,The aortic arch passes beneath the left main bronchus,It initially lies anterior to the pulmonary trunk,Its first major branch is the left subclavian artery,A,58%,6%,5%,28%,2%,"Explanation:
The aorta receives oxygenated blood from the lungs and delivers it to the body. It can be divided into three parts:
The ascending aorta
The arch of the aorta
The descending aorta
  The ascending aorta commences at the opening of the aortic valve in the left ventricle of the heart. It runs through a common pericardial sheath with the pulmonary trunk. The ascending aorta and pulmonary trunk twist around each other, with the aorta initially lying posterior to the pulmonary trunk, before twisting to the right and lying anteriorly to it.
  At the root of the ascending aorta, the lumen contains three aortic sinuses. The left aortic sinus contains the origin of the left coronary artery and the right aortic sinus contains the right coronary artery. Together these two arteries supply the heart. The third sinus, which is called the posterior aortic sinus, does not give rise to a coronary artery.
  The aortic arch commences at the point of the pericardial reflection on the aorta, which is posterior to the manubriosternal joint at the level of the second costal cartilage. It passes posterior and to the left, over the left main bronchus and ends at the left side of the body of the 4th thoracic vertebra. Its highest level is the mid point of the manubrium sterni and it is at this level that its three main branches arise:
Brachiocephalic artery, which supplies blood to the brain, head, and right side of the thorax
Left common carotid artery, which supplies blood to the left side of the head and neck
Left subclavian artery, which supplies blood to the left side of the thorax
  The descending aorta commences at the end of the arch of the aorta, which is at the level of the intervertebral disc between the 4th and 5th thoracic vertebrae. The descending aorta, in turn, becomes then thoracic and abdominal aorta.
  The aorta and its three main branches
 ",FALSE,"I chose number 5 because the left subclavian artery is the first major branch of the aorta. It branches off of the aortic arch and supplies blood to the left arm.

The description of a solid lesion (albeit hypoechoic) should steer you away from a liver cyst or haemangioma. Metastasis in a patient this age would be unlikely, as would HCC, especially considering the background liver appears normal. Another key feature is a normal AFP which would not be a feature with HCC. Fibrolamellar carcinoma usually occurs in younger individuals (in their 30s) with normal background liver. AFP is usually normal. It calcifies more commonly than HCC. Calcification is extremely rare with melanoma metastasis.
  Fibrolamellar carcinoma
Fibrolamellar carcinoma of the liver is a specific subtype which occurs in slightly younger patients with otherwise normal livers. It is a lobulated mass on ultrasound with variable echotexture but the central fibrous scar is usually hypoechoic and does not enhance on CT. The lack of enhancement, and sometimes presence of calcification, within the scar separates it from fibrous nodular hyperplasia which is the main differential diagnosis.

Duodenal diverticulum
Diverticulae of the duodenum are surprisingly common and all too often overlooked on CT scans. They can be found in around a fifth of patients.

14126,230652,A 72-year-old man is undergoing pre-operative assessment prior to a routine TURP procedure for some troublesome lower urinary tract symptoms. When his PSA is found to be slightly elevated he undergoes an MRI scan for further investigation. A 12mm tumour is seen in the left peripheral zone. It returns low signal on the T2 weighted sequences. Dynamic contrast enhancement analysis reveals a type 2 curve. Which of the following accurately describes this? Select ONE answer only.,"SBA: Genito urinary, Adrenal, Obstetrics & Gynaecology and Breast",An increasing intensity with a long plateau phase,A gently increasing intensity,A rapid wash in and subsequent washout phase,An initial plateau followed by a long washout phase,A double peak wash in phase,A,85%,3%,5%,7%,1%,"Explanation:
Axial dynamic contrast enhanced imaging (after non-contrast axial T1) is essential to differentiate between between PIRADS 3 and 4 lesions. The three types of curve are known as type 1-2 curves. Type 3 curves are considered most suspicious for prostate cancer. Just like for breast cancer contrast enhancement curves, in a metabolically active lesion there is usually rapid uptake and rapid washout of contrast, leading to the classical type 3 curve. Type 1 and 2 curves in prostate imaging can also occur in malignant lesions but type 3 curves are the most concerning.
  PIRADS curves © Medical Exam Prep
  The assessment of peripheral zone and central zone lesions is very different in PIRADS assessment.
Peripheral zone
The highest grade of suspicion for malignancy in the peripheral zone is indicated by the presence of marked restricted diffusion (focal high b-value and corresponding low ADC signal), with a PIRADS 5 lesion being one that is greater than 1.5 cm. PIRADS 3 lesions will show some restricted diffusion but this is far less (subjective analysis) than for PIRADS 4 lesions. Dynamic contrast enhancement is used for assessment of peripheral zone lesions only - differentiating between lesions which show only limited restricted diffusion. If there is dynamic contrast enhancement with a type 3 washout curve, the lesion becomes a PIRADS 4 lesion despite the only limited restriction in diffusion.
Transitional zone
The highest grade of suspicion for transitional zone lesions is reserved for moderate T2 lesion which is lenticular or non-circumscribed and moderately T2 hypointense (PIRADS 5 >1.5 cm).
Three plane T2 imaging is common practice and enables full assessment of the peripheral zone of the prostate, particularly examining for extra-capsular extension, bladder base or seminal vesical invasion. T2 is also the most important sequence for lesions in the transitional zone.
Diffusion weighted imaging is essential for PIRADS calculation and is the first sequence that should be used to evaluate lesions in the peripheral zone.
The T1 weighted sequences are also useful to check for the presence of any haemorrhagic foci although since most patients now undergo their MRI scan prior to any biopsies being taken this has become far less important.
Interestingly the ADC map is more sensitive for carcinoma of the prostate (in the peripheral zone) than the DWI sequences. A finding of focal low signal on the ADC map may be seen in the absence of a corresponding high DWI focus. In the transitional zone however, the T2 sequences are more sensitive.",FALSE,I chose this answer because a type 2 curve on dynamic contrast enhancement analysis is characterized by a rapid wash in and subsequent washout phase. This means that the intensity of the signal increases rapidly and then slowly decreases. This is the best description of the MRI scan results of the 72-year-old man.,2,,D,FALSE,,C,TRUE,A
9511,230652,A 64-year-old man is reviewed in clinic 8 years following a partial gastrectomy for a T2N0M0 gastrointestinal stromal tumour. He is experiencing symptoms of dysphagia and early satiety. You have been asked to perform a barium meal to find the cause of the problem. The barium meal shows a mottled filling defect which does not appear to be attached to the gastric wall. What is the most likely explanation?,SBA: Gastrointestinal,Bezoar,Local recurrence,Bouveret syndrome,Mirizzi syndrome,Duplication cyst,A,89%,4%,6%,1%,1%,"Explanation:
Bezoar
The word bezoar comes from the Persian word for antidote (JK Rowling had a point), and quite apart from their usage in the fictional wizarding world of Harry Potter the term is used to describe concretions of ingested matter which have collected in the stomach or other part of the gastrointestinal tract.
A phytobezoar  - this consists of undigested fibrous plant matter
A trichobezoar – this consists of ingested hair and occurs almost exclusively in women, 80% of whom are under the age of 30.
A number of conditions can predispose patients to developing a bezoar; chiefly those which impede passage through the stomach due to either the sheer quantity of ingested matter, the lack of gastric motility or an outright gastric outlet obstruction.
Underlying causes of a bezoar
Poor gastric motility (vagotomy, diabetes, connective tissue disorder)
Vagotomy
Diabetes
Connective tissue disorder
Myotonic dystrophy
Hypothyroidism
Insufficient mechanical or acid/protease action
Gastrectomy
Dental problems
Gastric outlet obstruction
Ulcers
Strictures
  On a fluoroscopic study the bezoar will appear as a large intraluminal filling defect which moves with patient positioning and does not appear to be fixed to the wall at any point. Often on CT the bezoar will be strikingly obvious as a large but smoothly rounded heterogenous mass within the stomach. Locules of gas within the mass are common.
  Bouveret syndrome
This is akin to a gallstone ileus where the level of obstruction is the proximal duodenum and there is consequential gastric outlet obstruction.
  Mirizzi syndrome
Obstruction of the common bile duct by extrinsic compression from a gallstone sitting within the cystic duct is called Mirizzi syndrome.
  Duplication cysts
Around quarter of duplication cysts occur in each of the ileum, oesophagus and colon (of these the ileum is the most common). The remaining quarter includes the stomach, jejunum and duodenum. A barium study may show a filling defect reminiscent of an extrinsic mass and if it is visible on ultrasound it would appear as a rounded or tubular cystic mass. For the most part however the diagnosis can be made on CT or MRI. The thin wall of the cyst may enhance slightly on CT and on MRI they will return high T2 signal, much as would be expected from a cystic structure.
  Stromal tumour also known as GIST (Gastrointestinal stromal tumour)
Particularly when of low staging at resection, these tumours carry an excellent prognosis. Unfortunately around half of patients present with metastatic disease owing to the relatively indolent nature of the primary lesion. Tumour histology is used to guide follow up and newer antibody therapies have also improved outcomes significantly.
70% of GISTs occur in the stomach with most of the remainder being found in the small bowel. Clinical presentation varies slightly with the exact location but dysphagia and early satiety are common, as are sequelae from mucosal ulceration and bleeding. They can occur as a feature of neurofibromatosis type 1 and are also discussed in connection to the Carney triad (Not to be confused with Carney syndrome). On imaging they may be occult or appear as a well-circumscribed submucosal mass. The low attenuation is attributable to central necrosis within the mass. Characteristically however they tend to enlarge extraluminally into the lesser sac, gastrosplenic or gastrohepatic ligaments. Of note, lymph node enlargement is specifically not a feature and an alternative diagnosis should be sought if lymph node enlargement is present.

 ",FALSE,"I chose option 1, Local Recurrence, as the most likely explanation for the mottled filling defect seen on the barium meal. This is because the patient had a partial gastrectomy 8 years prior for a gastrointestinal stromal tumour, and the symptoms of dysphagia and early satiety suggest that the tumour may have recurred in the same area. Local recurrence is a common complication of gastrectomy and can present with similar symptoms.",2,,A,TRUE,,A,TRUE,A

What is the most likely diagnosis?",SBA: Musculoskeletal and Trauma,Enteropathic arthropathy,Haemochromatosis,Wilson disease,Calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease,Alkaptonuria,A,96%,1%,1%,1%,1%,"Explanation:
Enteropathic arthropathy
Sacroiliitis and spondylitis are the hallmarks of enteropathic arthropathy. It is an important seronegative spondyloarthropathy. Outside of the axial skeleton, other features common to all seronegative spondyloarthropathies are also found. These include arthritis in the hands and feet, uveitis, and enthesitis (especially calcaneal). Interestingly although it is most commonly discussed in relation to Crohn’s disease and Ulcerative Colitis, only 5 and 10% respectively of patients with these conditions will develop enteropathic arthropathy. By contrast of patients with Whipple disease, around 75-90% of them will suffer from enteropathic arthropathy. Infection with Salmonella, Shigella and Yersinia are also known associations.
  Wilson disease
Inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion, this disease results from an excess of copper within the body due to the inability of the liver to excrete it. It can present in childhood with cirrhosis but later presentations are more likely to be due to the neuropsychiatric manifestations. Clinically adolescent or adult patients develop tremor and dysarthria due to copper deposition in the lentiform nucleus. The classic diagnostic feature is Kayser-Fleischer pigment rings in the eyes. Radiologically the following features can be seen:
Hepatic manifestations: The liver appears normal on MRI since fatty infiltration effectively cancels out the paramagnetic effects of copper
Musculoskeletal manifestations: Generalised osteoporosis, subarticular cysts, chondrocalcinosis and arthropathy which can mimic CPPD
CNS manifestations: White matter atrophy and T2 hyperintensities predominantly affecting the basal ganglia and thalami. T1 signal is also high in these areas, differentiating it from many of the other basal ganglia disorders. There is a classical feature of ‘sparing of the red nucleus’ leading to an appearance known as the giant panda sign at the level of the pons.
  Alkaptonuria also known as ochronosis
This condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. It is caused by excessive circulating levels of homogentisic acid (HGA) when the enzyme which would usually degrade it is deficient. HGA has an affinity for collagen and accumulates in the connective tissues throughout the body. In visible light HGA has a blackish colour and thus the disease can be diagnosed in infancy when a baby’s nappies are stained black by the presence of HGA in the urine. By the time patients reach their 20s pigmentation may be visible in their skin, particularly the ears. This is initially a dark yellow colour (hence the term ochronosis, from ‘Ochre’ in Greek meaning a dark yellow colour) but can progress to blue-grey and black.
In imaging chondrocalcinosis is the most prominent feature, with calcification and destruction of the intervertebral discs. Premature osteoarthritic changes to the hands, feet, shoulders, hips and knees will also develop as the collagen deteriorates. Deposition in the heart and kidneys too leads to cardiac and renal failure.
  Haemochromatosis
The primary version of this disease can be inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion. Excess dietary iron is absorbed and this accumulates in all tissues of the body leading to various different problems.
Secondary haemochromatosis can arise if patients receive numerous blood transfusions without sufficient chelation to mitigate against the iron overload.
Cirrhosis – the presence of the excess iron in the liver leads to unusual signal properties on an MRI scan. Iron is paramagnetic and causes spin dephasing. T2* and T2 sequences are particularly vulnerable to this effect but lower than expected signal will be seen on all sequences. Importantly the signal from the spleen and bone marrow should be normal. By contrast they will be involved in cases of transfusional siderosis.
Generalised osteoporosis
Hook like osteophytes on the radial aspect of the metacarpal heads – these are highly characteristic
Chondrocalcinosis, particularly affecting the knees
Insulin dependent diabetes
Congestive cardiomyopathy
Skin pigmentation
  Calcium pyrophosphate dehydrate disease (CPPD) also known as pseudogout
CPPD can present in an acute or subacute fashion but is also seen as a chronic cause of joint inflammation. It may be misdiagnosed as simple osteoarthritis owing to its often bilateral and symmetrical distribution but there are also a couple of areas of the body which can be affected in particular, and which would be unusual for isolated degenerative changes.

Please note the question asks which option is NOT a feature.
Orbital lymphoproliferative disorders
Lymphoproliferative disorders include leukaemias, lymphomas, and less aggressive collections of lymphoid tissue. The term is used particularly in head and neck radiology where histological diagnosis of such entities is key. Some masses on a CT scan can have a 'typical' appearance for a lymphoma but are actually only benign lymphoid hyperplastic tissue and thus the term lymphoproliferative disorder covers both entities accurately.
There is a huge spectrum of imaging appearances, ranging from well defined, heterogenous mildly enhancing masses to poorly defined, homogeneous, avidly enhancing masses. There is also significant overlap with the imaging features of other non-lymphomatous orbital lesions.
Findings may be bilateral or unilateral although most cases of primary lymphoma are unilateral and most cases of benign disease are bilateral. Proptosis is common owing to simple mass effect posterior to the globe.
Typically orbital lymphoma is seen as a hyperdense mass with contrast enhancement on CT but they may be isodense.

Select ONE answer only.,SBA: Central Nervous and Head & Neck,Asymmetry,Cerebral atrophy,Bilateral findings,High T2 signal in white matter,Low T2 signal in white matter,A,83%,5%,5%,5%,1%,"Explanation:
Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML)
This is a JC virus mediated phenomenon which causes asymmetrical patchy white matter changes. These can be bilateral. The testable feature is involvement of the cortical U-fibres which separates it from HIV encephalopathy where the U-fibres are spared. Other differentiating features are that PML usually causes asymmetrical changes whereas those of HIV encephalopathy are usually symmetrical and that cortical atrophy is a feature of HIV encephalopathy but not PML.
  HIV encephalopathy
Separating HIV encephalopathy from PML can challenging in real life. HIV encephalopathy causes bilateral symmetrical white matter changes, seen as high T2 signal (The T1 sequences can be normal). There is also sparing of the subcortical U-fibres. Another feature which separates it from PML is the presence of notable cerebral atrophy. This is not a feature of PML and if present should be attributed to a second pathology.

Select ONE answer only.,"SBA: Genito urinary, Adrenal, Obstetrics & Gynaecology and Breast",Transvaginal and transabdominal ultrasound,Transvaginal ultrasound,MRI pelvis,"CT chest, abdomen and pelvis",CT abdomen and pelvis,A,51%,13%,11%,17%,8%,"Explanation:
This question is a little frustrating as the practicalities of day to day work do not translate well to paper. The likely reality is that this patient would have ultrasound, MRI and CT imaging requested concurrently given the vignette provided. That being said, the first port of call for imaging the ovaries remains ultrasound and a combine trans-vaginal/trans-abdominal approach is optimal.
If an ovarian lesion is found it can be classified with a U-score to determine the likelihood of malignancy. Elevated ca-125 levels can and do occur with benign ovarian pathology as well as infective conditions such as pelvic inflammatory disease.
  Ovarian cancer
There are a number of different types of ovarian carcinoma and the final diagnosis will be a histological one. On imaging the features can be varied.
  Subtypes Frequency and age
Malignant epithelial tumours (Serous, mucinous, endometroid, clear cell) 85%, patients in their 60s and 70s
Malignant germ cell tumours (Teratoma, dysgerminaoma, choricarcinoma, mixed) 7%, patients < 30 years of age
Metastases < 10%
Sex cord stromal tumours around 5%
  A number of factors increase the risk of developing ovarian cancer in an individual. Anything which increases the number of ovulatory cycles a woman undergoes in her lifetime will increase the risk of ovarian cancer (early menarche, late menopause, nulliparity), and vice versa (multiparity, breastfeeding, oral contraceptive pill use). A family history of related cancers also increases the risk.
Presenting symptoms may be quite vague with abdominal pains, constipation or urinary frequency being the only complaints if any from the patient. Consequently, many tumours have already spread beyond the ovary by the time of diagnosis. Initial investigation is often with ultrasound. Although ovarian cancers can have a variety of imaging appearances, solid or papillary components to a cystic mass are strongly indicative of malignancy. Predominantly solid masses with some small cystic components are also likely to be malignant but completely perfectly solid lesions are actually more likely to be benign. Ovarian fibromas and fibrothecomas are both benign lesions which can be seen as solid masses however despite this, without prior imaging for comparison a solid ovarian lesion is malignant until proven otherwise.",TRUE,"The transvaginal and transabdominal ultrasound is the best management step for this patient because it will allow the doctor to get a better look at the patient's abdominal area and to determine the cause of the distension and weight loss. The ultrasound will also allow the doctor to check for any masses or tumors that may be causing the elevated Ca-125 level.

Three days later she comes back to hospital and is seen in the A+E department complaining of ongoing abdominal pain and abdominal fullness. She undergoes a CT scan which shows a large volume of intraperitoneal fluid measuring 10HU. What is the most likely underlying cause of her symptoms?,SBA: Gastrointestinal,Low insertion of the cystic duct,Intra-abdominal abscess formation,Pseudomyxoma peritonei,Budd-Chiari syndrome,Splenic artery thrombosis,A,88%,5%,3%,4%,1%,"Explanation:
It is sometimes difficult on CT to prove that intra-abdominal fluid is bile. Distinguishing it from post-op fluid collections in particular may be challenging. Usually bile measures around 0-10HU and often its copious nature points to the diagnosis since the liver produces a surprisingly large volume of bile each day.
Bile duct anatomy is highly variable with only around 60% of patients having ‘normal’ anatomy. A trifurcation is present in around a further 10% of patients and consists of the left and two right hepatic ducts converging at once.
In preparation for a cholecystectomy, patients usually undergo either an MRCP or an ERCP if not both. These help delineate ductal anatomy to mitigate against aberrancy. Those most at risk of iatrogenic injury during cholecystectomy are those where insertions of other ducts occur close to the insertion of the cystic duct and those with extrahepatic courses which can be mistaken for the common hepatic or common bile duct. Those most at risk of iatrogenic injury are usually one of two broad categories of anatomical variations:
Anomalous course of the right posterior duct
Anomalous course of the cystic duct
Bile duct anatomical variations
Normal (60%): right anterior and posterior ducts combine then join with the left hepatic duct. The cystic duct joins the common hepatic duct in the middle third of its extrahepatic course. Beyond this point the duct is referred to as the common bile duct.
Trifucation (10%): the right anterior, right posterior and left hepatic ducts converge at once within the liver.
Aberrant right posterior duct draining into (extrahepatic) common hepatic duct (4%)
Aberrant right posterior duct draining into cystic duct (2%)
Aberrant cystic duct draining into right hepatic duct (2%)
Others (~2%)
Low insertion of cystic duct (10% of cystic duct anomalies)
Gadoxetic acid disodium (Primovist) and gadobentate disodium (MultiHance) are hepatobiliary specific MRI contrast agents. Since it is excreted by hepatocytes it is removed from the body in bile and thus can be exceedingly useful in diagnosing a bile leak. A hepatobiliary phase scan at around 20 minutes for Primovist or 100 minutes for MultiHance can provide the diagnosis in many such cases.
CT cholangiography is possible using meglumine iotroxate (Biliscopin) which is excreted by the liver but has the obvious disadvantage of added radiation dose. The contrast agent is also less widely available than Primovist or MultiHance are.
Vicarious excretion of water-soluble contrast material does occur via the hepatic route. It can sometimes be seen in cases of renal failure or obstruction and may also occur on CT scans taken 1-2 days after a previous CT scan in otherwise healthy patients.",FALSE,"The most likely underlying cause of the patient's symptoms is an intra-abdominal abscess formation. This is because a large volume of intraperitoneal fluid is a common symptom of an abscess, and it is also a common complication of laparoscopic cholecystectomy.

Embryologically the thyroid originates from the foramen caecum at the posterior aspect of the tongue and migrates inferiorly to its usual position along the thyroglossal duct. Where there is failure of this migration thyroid tissue can be found at any point along the path of the thyroglossal duct. Although not classically described as cystic in nature, this answer is the best of the choices provided.
A dermoid cyst classically contains fluid, fat and calcium as well as being a midline structure. They can be found in the floor of the mouth but are usually more complex in morphology than straiqhtforwardly cystic.
A thornwaldt cyst is a midline congenital pouch found in the nasopharynx of young adults. It presents as halitosis or a foul taste in the mouth.

Axial dynamic contrast enhanced imaging (after non-contrast axial T1) is essential to differentiate between between PIRADS 3 and 4 lesions. The three types of curve are known as type 1-2 curves. Type 3 curves are considered most suspicious for prostate cancer. Just like for breast cancer contrast enhancement curves, in a metabolically active lesion there is usually rapid uptake and rapid washout of contrast, leading to the classical type 3 curve. Type 1 and 2 curves in prostate imaging can also occur in malignant lesions but type 3 curves are the most concerning.
  PIRADS curves © Medical Exam Prep
  The assessment of peripheral zone and central zone lesions is very different in PIRADS assessment.
Peripheral zone
The highest grade of suspicion for malignancy in the peripheral zone is indicated by the presence of marked restricted diffusion (focal high b-value and corresponding low ADC signal), with a PIRADS 5 lesion being one that is greater than 1.5 cm. PIRADS 3 lesions will show some restricted diffusion but this is far less (subjective analysis) than for PIRADS 4 lesions. Dynamic contrast enhancement is used for assessment of peripheral zone lesions only - differentiating between lesions which show only limited restricted diffusion. If there is dynamic contrast enhancement with a type 3 washout curve, the lesion becomes a PIRADS 4 lesion despite the only limited restriction in diffusion.
Transitional zone
The highest grade of suspicion for transitional zone lesions is reserved for moderate T2 lesion which is lenticular or non-circumscribed and moderately T2 hypointense (PIRADS 5 >1.5 cm).
Three plane T2 imaging is common practice and enables full assessment of the peripheral zone of the prostate, particularly examining for extra-capsular extension, bladder base or seminal vesical invasion. T2 is also the most important sequence for lesions in the transitional zone.
Diffusion weighted imaging is essential for PIRADS calculation and is the first sequence that should be used to evaluate lesions in the peripheral zone.
The T1 weighted sequences are also useful to check for the presence of any haemorrhagic foci although since most patients now undergo their MRI scan prior to any biopsies being taken this has become far less important.
Interestingly the ADC map is more sensitive for carcinoma of the prostate (in the peripheral zone) than the DWI sequences. A finding of focal low signal on the ADC map may be seen in the absence of a corresponding high DWI focus. In the transitional zone however, the T2 sequences are more sensitive.",TRUE,"I chose 3.

Select ONE answer only.",SBA: Central Nervous and Head & Neck,Subdural haematoma,Epidural haematoma,Intercerebral parafalcine haematoma,Combined haematomas,Subarachnoid haematoma,A,81%,6%,3%,3%,7%,"Explanation:
The learning point here is how a haemorrhage deals with the sutures. Extradural (aka epidural) haematomas do cross the midline but do not cross suture lines as this is where the dura is attached to the skull. Subdural haematomas on the other hand do not cross the midline but do extend along the falx, dipping down and affecting both sides of the falx cerebri on the coronal views for example. Combined haematomas (ie extradural and subdural) are possible but on balance the question seems to imply that it is one haematoma rather than two with separate properties for each.
A subarachnoid haemorrhage can be seen as high density on CT within the small fissures on the surface of the brain, as well as into the larger fissures such as the interhemispheric fissure. Obviously very small subarachnoid haemorrhages can be very hard to spot on CT scans and a high index of suspicion is required.

12161,230652,A 33-year-old man has worsening unilateral nasal obstruction and epistaxis. His GP finds a polypoid mass in the left nasal cavity. A CT scan shows a soft tissue mass arising from the lateral wall of the nasal cavity with bony destruction of the medial wall of the maxillary sinus and heterogenous enhancement post-contrast. What is the most likely diagnosis?,SBA: Central Nervous and Head & Neck,Schneiderian papilloma,Mucocoele,Squamous cell carcinoma,Antrochoanal polyp,Juvenile angiofibroma,A,38%,2%,29%,19%,13%,"Explanation:
There are many different names for what is most commonly called an inverted papilloma. The classical history is given here. It is a vascular tumour most usually arising from the lateral wall of the nasal cavity but which characteristically causes destruction of the medial wall of the maxillary sinus.
 ",FALSE,"I chose this answer because juvenile angiofibroma is the most likely diagnosis based on the symptoms and the CT scan findings. Juvenile angiofibroma is a tumor that typically affects adolescent males, and it is characterized by a polypoid mass in the nasal cavity with bony destruction of the medial wall of the maxillary sinus and heterogenous enhancement post-contrast.

What is the most likely diagnosis?","SBA: Genito urinary, Adrenal, Obstetrics & Gynaecology and Breast",Galactocoele,Radial scar,Abscess,Phyllodes tumour,Fibroadenoma,A,74%,1%,2%,3%,20%,"Explanation:
Galactocoele
A galactocoele appears during lactation as an enlarging painless mass. A fat-fluid level is a specific finding on a lateral view. These lesions would be far more likely to be ultrasound diagnoses than mammographic. They can have a variety of appearances, ranging from cystic with internal debris, to solid appearing masses. Posterior acoustic is an important feature which suggests a fluid component to the mass. Diagnosis is typically confirmed by aspirating milk from the lesion.
  A phyllodes tumour
These would typically be described as having a similar appearance to a fibroadenoma. They would usually appear as a lobulated round hypoechoic mass with ill-defined borders and a posterior acoustic shadow. Occasionally they can demonstrate a ‘halo’ sign. Patients are usually middle aged, slightly older than those with a fibroadenoma.
  Fibroadenoma
Popcorn calcification is pathognomonic of a fibroadenoma. They tend to be nodular or lobulated in contour but with smooth margins. They often show a ‘halo’ sign of low attenuation where tissue surrounding the lesion has been compressed. Patients are usually relatively young; 20s or 30s.
  Breast abscess
Clinical manifestations notwithstanding, would appear cystic on ultrasound.
  Radial scar

The patient most likely has asplenia. Almost all patients with asplenia have TAPVR. The liver position is more variable than it is with polysplenia but trilobed lungs is a specific finding associated with asplenia.
  Heterotaxy
There are two main forms of this congenital disorder:
Left sided isomerism (polysplenia)
Things that would usually be found on the left side are duplicated on the right side too. The most consistent features are the abnormalities of the spleen and IVC. The other features are commonly associated, but variably seen. The prognosis is slightly better than for asplenia syndrome as there is a lower association with congenital heart disease. There is still 75% mortality by age 5 though.
Spleen - multiple little spleens
IVC - interrupted IVC with azygos or hemiazygos continuation
Lung lobes - two on either side
Liver - situated centrally in the abdomen
Bowel - malrotation
Pancreas - truncated
Heart - ASD, VSD, PAPVR (less severe congenital heart disease)
  Right sided isomerism (asplenia)
Things that would normally be found on the right side are duplicated on the left side too. Strong association with severe congenital heart disease means the condition has a mortality rate of 80% by age 1. Beyond that, the most consistent feature is the absence of the spleen. Once again, the other features are commonly associated, but variably demonstrated.
Heart - TAPVR and other anomalies (Almost 100% have severe cyanotic congenital heart disease)
Spleen - absent
Lung lobes - three on either side (specific finding)
Liver - normal position (can be midline or malpositioned)
Bowel - malrotation
IVC - on same side as aorta (usually the right)
Kidneys - associated with horseshoe kidney",FALSE,"I chose 4 because heterotaxy is a condition in which normal left-right body symmetry is absent. This means that the organs are not in their normal positions. In this case, the antenatal scan showed TAPVR, which is Total Anomalous Pulmonary Venous Return. This is a congenital heart defect in which the pulmonary veins do not connect normally to the left atrium.

There are two parts to this question. The first is straightforward anatomy.  In the cervical spine the nerve roots exit above their named vertebral body; thus at the level of C4/5 it is the C5 which will be exiting. This is unlike the lumbar spine where the nerve root exits below its named vertebral body (ie L2 exits at the level of L2/3) and is explained by the presence of 8 cervical nerve roots with only 7 cervical vertebra.
There is also the concept of the exiting nerve root and the descending nerve root. This applies in particular to disc bulges/protrusions/extrusions and is more pertinent in the lumbar spine. The exiting nerve root at a given level will be one less than the descending nerve root. (ie at L2/3 the exiting nerve will be L2 and the descending nerve will be L3). Central disc pathology affects the descending nerve whereas paramedian or foraminal disc pathology may affect the exiting nerve.
The second is the imaging features which separate a disc recurrence from scar tissue. Scar tissue will show enhancement with contrast whereas disc material will not. Both scar tissue and recurrent disc protrusion will be extradural in location.

Oesophagitis
Inflammation of the oesophagus usually presents with severe pain on swallowing (odynophagia). There are many different aetiologies but there are a few features which can help separate the differential diagnoses on imaging.
Aetiology
Features
Candidiasis
Immunocompromised patients (including long term steroid therapy)

Drug-induced
Ulcers at sites of extrinsic compression in the mid oesophagus
Patients taking medication without enough water immediately prior to going to bed
Idiopathic eosinophilic oesophagitis
History of atopy usually present
Specific ring-like indentations to the oesophagus
  Glycogen acanthosis
This condition is caused by benign age-related squamous hyperplasia but, based on its imaging features, a differential diagnosis for candidiasis. On a barium swallow there will be small rounded white plaques in a random distribution, predominantly affecting the middle and upper oesophagus. Patients are typically middle aged or elderly.
  Intramural pseudodiverticulosis
This is a feature of candidal oesophagitis. Tiny diverticulae are found scattered along the length of the oesophagus and on a barium swallow the appearance can be quite impressive! Like most candidal infections oesophagitis is most common in patients with suppressed immunity including patients with diabetes, on steroids, or chemotherapy.",FALSE,"I chose number 3 because multiple small ulcers each surrounded by a radiolucent halo is a common sign of oesophagitis caused by a candidal infection.

What is a recognised complication of a malpositioned UVC in this position?,SBA: Paediatrics,Hepatic abscess,Pulmonary hypertension,Renal artery thrombosis,Spinal ischaemia,Line fracture,A,83%,4%,6%,2%,4%,"Explanation:
Umbilical venous catheters can be differentiated from Umbilical artery catheters as they go straight up, rather than curving inferiorly first, as is seen with arterial catheters.

The posterior tibial artery arises at the bifurcation of the popliteal artery, just beneath the fibrous arch of soleus, at the lower border of popliteus. It carries blood to the posterior compartment of the leg and the plantar surface of the foot.
The posterior tibial artery terminates by bifurcating into the medial and lateral plantar arteries deep to abductor hallucis. It is accompanied by a deep vein, the posterior tibial vein, throughout its course.
The posterior tibial artery pulse can be easily palpated posterior and inferior to the medial malleolus at Pimenta’s point. It is often examined at this point during the assessment of patients for the presence of peripheral vascular disease.
The pulse of the dorsalis pedis artery, not the posterior tibial artery, can be easily palpated on the dorsum of the foot lateral to the extensor hallucis longus tendon.
  The posterior tibial artery and its relations (from Gray’s Anatomy)
 ",TRUE,"I chose this answer because the posterior tibial artery is a terminal branch of the popliteal artery, and it terminates by bifurcating into the medial and lateral plantar arteries, which supply blood to the plantar surface of the foot. The other answers are incorrect because the posterior tibial artery does not carry blood to the dorsal surface of the foot, does not arise as a branch of the anterior tibial artery, and cannot be easily palpated posterior to the lateral malleolus.",1,"This question falls under category 1: Basic factual recall, either of basic science, physics, anatomy or regarding a procedure.",A,TRUE,,A,FALSE,E

10246,230652,"A 47-year-old man experiences sudden onset chest pain and is being investigated for a myocardial infarction. On examination, the A&E doctor notices he is unusually tall with pectus excavatum deformity and long fingers. An early diastolic murmur is heard on auscultation. What is the most likely diagnosis?",SBA: Cardiothoracic and vascular,Aortic dissection,Aortic regurgitation,Mitral stenosis,Rheumatic heart disease,Coarctation of the aorta,A,48%,39%,4%,1%,7%,"Explanation:
The patient has Marfan syndrome which is an autosomal dominant connective tissue disease. Among other common features associated with this condition, the patient in this scenario is tall, with arachnodactyly and pectus excavatum. An early diastolic murmur suggests regurgitation, usually of the aortic valve but less commonly the pulmonary valve. Aortic regurgitation is another feature common to Marfan syndrome but although this may be present it would not necessarily explain his sudden chest pain. Patients with Marfan syndrome are at increased risk of developing aortic dissection compared to the general population. 
Coarctation of the aorta is associated with a late systolic or continuous systolic murmur, though it can also cause aortic regurgitation as well.
Mitral stenosis gives a mid-diastolic murmur.
Rheumatic heart disease can affect any of the heart valves, although most commonly affects the mitral valve causing mitral stenosis.
Dissections are classified according to their involvement of the aortic root and their distal extent. There are two different classification systems. The Stanford classification is more useful clinically since the primary decision post-diagnosis is whether the dissection will be managed surgically or medically. Those involving the proximal aorta and arch are managed surgically. If the arch is not involved, the patient can be managed medically. Thus Stanford A dissections involve the aorta proximal to the origin of the left subclavian artery with or without concurrent distal involvement. Stanford B dissections do not involve the proximal aorta.
Most dissections originate just distal to the aortic valve and extend proximally, ie Stanford type A.
Traumatic aortic rupture is most likely to occur at the site of the ligamentum arteriosus, just distal to the origin of the left subclavian artery. This is termed the aortic isthmus. The proximal aorta is fixed by the ligamentum arteriosus but distal to this point the aorta is more freely mobile.

Dorsal Radiolunate
Lunate dislocation occurs secondary to a dorsal radiolunate injury.
  Scapholunate
Injury to the scapholunate ligaments results in SLAC and DISI (which is more common than VISI).

Retroperitoneal fibrosis
Around two thirds of cases are primary autoimmune manifestations as part of the spectrum of IgG4 related disease and these patients respond very well to steroid therapy. The remaining third can arise as a desmoplastic response in patients secondary to a variety of things.
  Causes of retroperitoneal fibrosis
Connective tissue diseases
Aortic aneurysm
Nodal metastases (retroperitoneal)
Drugs (methylsergide, beta blockers)
Lymphoma, Hodgkin disease
Radiation therapy
Methylsergide
Used in prophylactic treatment of migraines and cluster headaches
  Clinically patients present insidiously with back pain, weight loss and malaise. Renal failure and hypertension also occur due to compression of the renal arteries.
On CT there will be a periaortic mass. In the acute inflammatory phase contrast enhancement may be seen. One of the main differential diagnoses is Lymphoma. Retroperitoneal fibrosis causes a 'tapering down' appearance to the aorta, as opposed to the presence of enlarged retroperitoneal lymph nodes, which do not alter the shape of the high pressure abdominal aorta (this despite the fact that lymphoma is a leading cause of superior vena cava obstruction). The ureters can get caught up in the fibrosis at around L4/5 and become ectatic in their course. Bilateral medial deviation of the ureters is classical. Abnormal peristalsis and gradual tapering of the ureters is also seen.
On MRI fibrosis of any kind is usually low in signal and this is no exception. High signal on T2 can occur due to accompanying inflammation in some cases.
  IgG4 related disease
IgG4 related diseases are one of Radiology’s newest entities. They comprise a constellation of fibrotic conditions affecting virtually every part of the body, mediated by a subclass of Immunoglobulin called IgG4. Where one condition exists others may also be present. The more common of these include:
Orbital pseudotumour

The ankle has two sets of ligaments, which originate from each malleolus:
1. The medial (deltoid) ligament:
This is a multi-banded ligament that lies on the medial side of the ankle. It attaches proximally to the medial malleolus. It consists of four separate ligaments that fan out distally to attach to the talus, calcaneus and navicular. Its primary action is to resist over-eversion of the foot.
2. The lateral ligament:
The lateral collateral ligament is made up of three individual bands that all arise from the lateral malleolus. It resists over-inversion of the foot. The insertions of the three ligaments are as follows:
The anterior talofibular ligament: lateral aspect of the talus
The posterior talofibular ligament: posterior aspect of the talus
The calcaneofibular ligament: calcaneus
  The medial collateral (deltoid) ligament is much thicker and stronger than the lateral collateral ligament and less commonly injured.
Gravity stress radiographs assess the integrity of the deltoid ligament in lateral malleolar ankle fractures without talar shift.
 ",FALSE,"I chose 2 because gravity stress radiographs are used to assess the integrity of the lateral ligament, which is the most commonly injured structure in an ankle inversion injury.

Parinaud syndrome is the name given to the symptoms caused by compression of the tectal plate. These are highly testable and the main feature is paralysis of vertical gaze.
Tullio phenomenon refers to vertigo and nystagmus induced by loud noises. It is caused by superior semicircular canal dehiscence.
Gradenigo syndrome refers to the triad of otitis media, retro-orbital pain and Abducens nerve palsy which results from an abscess in the aerated petrous apex – petrous apicitis.
Eye of the tiger sign refers to low T2 signal in the globus pallidus due to iron accumulation. This is associated with Hallervoden-Spatz syndrome, with symptoms of spasticity and progressive dementia.
Lateral medullary syndrome aka Wallenburg syndrome is caused by infarction of the lateral medulla oblongata, supplied by the PICA.

10791,230652,An HRCT performed on an outpatient shows a classic tree-in-bud pattern peripherally in the middle lobe. Which of the following is the likely diagnosis?,SBA: Cardiothoracic and vascular,MAC,Cystic fibrosis,Diffuse panbronchiolitis,Aspergillosis,CMV infection,A,72%,7%,5%,9%,7%,"Explanation:
A tree-in-bud pattern occurs when the lumen of the terminal bronchiole is filled with radiopaque material. Historically the appearance was associated most strongly with tuberculosis however it is more recently recognized as a feature common to many different pathologies. The nature of the material depends on the underlying pathology. For instance:
Pus – mycobacterial infection
Mucus – cystic fibrosis
Cells – breast cancer, stomach cancer (infiltration of the centrilobular artery with tumour cells)
Aspirated substances
Inflammatory infiltrate – autoimmune conditions
Bronchial wall thickening - CMV
  Here we are given the term tree-in-bud but this can also be indicated with a visual description of this entity such as ‘small centrilobular nodules connected by branching opacities’ or words to that effect.
MAC – mycobacterium avium complex
This is an atypical mycobacterial infection is often seen in the form of Lady Windermere syndrome. Classically there is bronchiectasis and tree-in-bud in the right middle lobe which is affected in isolation from the rest of the lung and the patient is usually an otherwise perfectly healthy Caucasian elderly woman. Lady Windermere is the central character in a play by Oscar Wilde. The play was written in an era where it would have been considered impolite and unpleasant to cough. The term applies to a form of MAC infection thought to result from voluntary suppression of the kind of cough which would usually be expected with the airway irritation brought on a pathogen. Where MAC occurs in not otherwise healthy individuals there is an association with any disease causing bronchiectasis.
  Cystic fibrosis
Lung changes in cystic fibrosis affect all lobes of the lung.
The problems caused by this autosomal recessive condition have their origins in a two separate processes. Firstly exocrine gland dysfunction causes the usual mucus secretions of the lungs to be far more viscous than normal and thus harder to clear. Secondly ciliary dyskinesia means that this thick mucus is poorly cleared. The combination of both processes results in stasis of mucus in the lumen of the broncho-alveolar tree (giving rise to the tree-in-bud appearance) and this then becomes a breeding ground for various infections, with subsequent bronchiectasis.
  Diffuse panbronchiolitis
This is an idiopathic condition where there is progressive inflammation of the small airways in, as the name implies, a diffuse pattern. The classic patient demographic is a middle-aged non-smoker of Asian heritage.
  Aspergillosis
Of the different varieties of pulmonary aspergillosis it is allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) which is most associated with the tree-in-bud appearance. This occurs due to hypersensitivity towards aspergillus spp and is seen in asthmatics or, less commonly, patients with cystic fibrosis. Hypersensitivity reactions give rise to bronchial wall oedema and the broncho-alveolar lumen becomes filled with fluid. Superimposed mucous impaction is also a feature.

  CMV infection
An opportunistic infection, CMV is seen in immunocompromised patients, most commonly those with AIDs. As a cause of the tree-in-bud appearance it is unusual because the luminal opacification is derived from bronchial wall thickening as opposed to an exogenous substance.

14124,230652,A 72-year-old man is undergoing pre-operative assessment prior to a routine TURP procedure for some troublesome lower urinary tract symptoms. When his PSA is found to be slightly elevated he undergoes an MRI scan for further investigation. A 12mm tumour is seen in the left peripheral zone. It returns low signal on the T2 weighted sequences. Dynamic contrast enhancement analysis reveals a curve with an initial upslope followed by a plateau phase. What type of curve is being described? Select ONE answer only.,"SBA: Genito urinary, Adrenal, Obstetrics & Gynaecology and Breast",Type 2,Type 1,Type 3,Type 4,Type 5,A,88%,4%,7%,1%,1%,"Explanation:
Axial dynamic contrast enhanced imaging (after non-contrast axial T1) is essential to differentiate between between PIRADS 3 and 4 lesions. The three types of curve are known as type 1-2 curves. Type 3 curves are considered most suspicious for prostate cancer. Just like for breast cancer contrast enhancement curves, in a metabolically active lesion there is usually rapid uptake and rapid washout of contrast, leading to the classical type 3 curve. Type 1 and 2 curves in prostate imaging can also occur in malignant lesions but type 3 curves are the most concerning.
  PIRADS curves © Medical Exam Prep
  The assessment of peripheral zone and central zone lesions is very different in PIRADS assessment.
Peripheral zone
The highest grade of suspicion for malignancy in the peripheral zone is indicated by the presence of marked restricted diffusion (focal high b-value and corresponding low ADC signal), with a PIRADS 5 lesion being one that is greater than 1.5 cm. PIRADS 3 lesions will show some restricted diffusion but this is far less (subjective analysis) than for PIRADS 4 lesions. Dynamic contrast enhancement is used for assessment of peripheral zone lesions only - differentiating between lesions which show only limited restricted diffusion. If there is dynamic contrast enhancement with a type 3 washout curve, the lesion becomes a PIRADS 4 lesion despite the only limited restriction in diffusion.
Transitional zone
The highest grade of suspicion for transitional zone lesions is reserved for moderate T2 lesion which is lenticular or non-circumscribed and moderately T2 hypointense (PIRADS 5 >1.5 cm).
Three plane T2 imaging is common practice and enables full assessment of the peripheral zone of the prostate, particularly examining for extra-capsular extension, bladder base or seminal vesical invasion. T2 is also the most important sequence for lesions in the transitional zone.
Diffusion weighted imaging is essential for PIRADS calculation and is the first sequence that should be used to evaluate lesions in the peripheral zone.
The T1 weighted sequences are also useful to check for the presence of any haemorrhagic foci although since most patients now undergo their MRI scan prior to any biopsies being taken this has become far less important.
Interestingly the ADC map is more sensitive for carcinoma of the prostate (in the peripheral zone) than the DWI sequences. A finding of focal low signal on the ADC map may be seen in the absence of a corresponding high DWI focus. In the transitional zone however, the T2 sequences are more sensitive.",TRUE,"I chose option 4 because a Type 2 curve is the type of curve that is typically seen when a tumor is seen on an MRI scan and it has low signal on the T2 weighted sequences. This type of curve is characterized by an initial upslope followed by a plateau phase. This indicates that the tumor is likely to be a slow-growing, low-grade tumor.",1,"3.

9211,230652,A 49-year-old woman with obstructive jaundice undergoes an MRCP. There is a smooth stricture in the common hepatic duct with duct dilatation and extrinsic compression from round filling defect in cystic duct. What is the most likely diagnosis?,SBA: Gastrointestinal,Mirizzi syndrome,Primary sclerosing cholangitis,Primary biliary sclerosis,Gallstones,Klatskin syndrome,A,93%,1%,1%,2%,2%,"Explanation:
Mirizzi syndrome
Mirizzi syndrome can present as cholecystitis and occurs when the common hepatic duct is obstructed by the mechanical pressure of a stone within the cystic duct. It follows that patients whose cystic duct happens to insert low in the course of the common hepatic duct are predisposed to this condition.
  Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC)
Although benign in nature PSC can wreak havoc for patients unfortunate enough to develop it. It is twice as common in men as in women and 70% of patients have a history of inflammatory bowel disease. Bile duct strictures form (particularly at the bifurcation/confluence of ducts) and lead to an obstructive jaundice picture. In between strictures there is dilatation and the combination of the two leads to a string of beads type appearance. The appearance on ERCP or MRCP in some patients can also resemble a tree in winter with pruning of the upstream branches. Outpouchings also form which are either true or pseudo-diverticulae. Hepatic atrophy is present in chronic cases, although the caudate lobe is usually spared. Patients unfortunately have a higher risk of developing cholangiocarcinoma.
  Primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC)
This can be difficult to distinguish from PSC however whereas PSC can involve both intra and extrahepatic ducts, PBC only involves the intrahepatic ducts. It is an autoimmune condition and, like many other autoimmune conditions, patients are typically women in their middle ages. Antimitochondrial antibodies (AMA) are present in the vast majority of patients. On imaging, the secondary cirrhotic effects are most pertinent with caudate lobe hypertrophy and left lobar atrophy. The periportal halo sign as seen on MRI is reasonably specific and relates to fluid accumulation around the portal triad.
  A Klatskin tumour
A Klatskin tumour is an intrahepatic tumour arising at the confluence of the left and right hepatic ducts where they join to form the common hepatic duct. Consequently it obstructs both ducts separately. On MRCP or ERCP this is seen as duct dilatation where the left and right ducts fail to communicate with one another. The location is relevant in identifying this type of tumours since they tend to be aggressive in nature, even for cholangiocarcinomas.",FALSE,"Klatskin syndrome is the most likely diagnosis in this case since it is characterized by a smooth stricture in the common hepatic duct with duct dilatation and extrinsic compression from a round filling defect in the cystic duct. Klatskin syndrome is caused by a tumor located at the junction of the right and left hepatic ducts, which can lead to obstruction of the bile ducts and obstructive jaundice.",2,,D,TRUE,,A,FALSE,FALSE
13676,230652,A 13-year-old girl complains of pain in her wrist following a fall. An x-ray reveals no fractures but the carpal angle is markedly decreased to around 110o and the proximal carpus is V-shaped. Additionally the distal radio-ulnar joint is dorsally subluxed. With which condition is this deformity LEAST likely to be associated?,SBA: Musculoskeletal and Trauma,Negative ulnar variance,Positive ulnar variance,Ollier disease,Turner syndrome,Diaphyseal aclasis,A,43%,27%,18%,6%,5%,"Explanation:
The patient has a Madelung deformity. This arises due to a problem with the development of the ulnar side of the distal end of the radius. The distal radioulnar joint subluxes and the ulna displaces dorsally. Owing to growth failure of the distal radius, by comparison the ulna appears lengthened (Positive ulnar variance). The carpal bones become altered in shape from the norm, in particular the lunate appears triangular. The overall appearance is of a V-shape to the radioulnarcarpal joint with angles of <120o considered characteristic.
The Madelung deformity has a number of different aetiologies (Mnemonic = DIGIT):
D = Dysplastic - Ollier disease, osteochondromatosis, achondroplasia, mucopolysaccharidoses, diaphyseal aclasis
I = Idiopathic

Dorsal Intercalated Segment Instability (DISI)
This occurs in the setting of carpal instability when there is widening of the scapholunate angle to greater than 60 degrees.
  Scaphoid Non-Union Advanced collapse (SNAC)
This occurs following a scaphoid fracture. It is similar to SLAC but there is a normal scapholunate distance, with a scaphoid fracture. Like SLAC, there is radioscaphoid degenerative change, followed by proximal migration of the capitate and eventually dorsal intercalated instability.
  Scaphoid-lunate advanced collapse (SLAC)
This occurs following injury to the scapholunate ligament or secondary to CPPD. It is similar to SNAC but there is scapholunate widening, rather than a scaphoid fracture. Radioscaphoid degenerative changes are an early feature, followed by proximal migration of the capitate and eventually dorsal intercalated instability.

On MRI scanning he is found to have a ring enhancing lesion with marked vasogenic oedema. Which of the following will helps establish the diagnosis of an abscess over that of a metastasis for this patient?",SBA: Paediatrics,Restriction in diffusion,"Vasogenic oedema, not cytotoxic oedema",The histopathology of the known primary,A thick enhancing wall,The presence of calcification,A,67%,5%,3%,23%,3%,"Explanation:
There is a mnemonic for ring enhancing lesions. MAGIC DR (Metastasis, abscess, glioma, infarction, contusion, demyelination, radiation necrosis). Largely however the differential diagnosis is between a metastasis and an abscess.
An abscess tends to show a thin smooth rim of enhancement whereas mitotic lesions often have a thick, irregular margin.
The central liquefied portion of an abscess characteristically (and reasonably reliably) shows restriction in diffusion due to the high viscosity of the pus.
It is possible for hypercellular tumours and their metastases in the paediatric age bracket (such as neuroblastoma, Ewing sarcoma, osteogenic sarcoma and hepatoblastoma) to exhibit restricted diffusion to a greater or lesser extent. This is however, far less reliable a sign than the restriction in diffusion shown by abscesses.
Some studies more recently have shown a broad correlation between cellular differentiation and restriction in diffusion with poorly differentiated tumours returning lower signal on ADC maps (i.e. restricting diffusion).
  Cytotoxic vs vasogenic oedema
Cytotoxic oedema occurs due to hypoxia where the cell membrane ion pumps are no longer able to maintain the concentration gradient. The result is cellular swelling and a concurrent reduction in the extracellular fluid volume. There is restriction in diffusion with cytotoxic oedema. This is usually due to infarction and can affect both the grey and white matter.
Vasogenic oedema occurs due to a breakdown in the blood-brain barrier, of any cause. This can be seen with tumours, trauma or haemorrhage. On imaging the white matter is predominantly affected, with cortical sparing. Vasogenic oedema will respond to steroid therapy, unlike cytotoxic oedema.",FALSE,"The presence of vasogenic oedema (option 1) is suggestive of an abscess, but it is not definitive. The histopathology of the known primary (option 2) may be helpful in ruling out a metastasis, but it is not definitive.

Select ONE answer only.,SBA: Musculoskeletal and Trauma,L4,L5,L6,L3,L2,A,75%,14%,8%,2%,0%,"Explanation:
In the cervical spine the nerve roots exit at the spinal cord without needing to traverse (as in the lumbar spine). The exiting nerve root takes the name of the vertebra BELOW the affected disc. A disc protrusion at C3/4 will affect the C4 nerve root. This allows for the extra nerve root at C8 before reaching the thoracic spine. In the thoracic spine the affected level takes its name from the vertebral body ABOVE that level.
In the lumbar spine the exiting nerve root is usually compressed in the neural foramen, whereas the traversing nerve root is compressed usually in the lateral recess. Far lateral bulges affect the exiting nerve root (takes its name from the vertebral body ABOVE that level). Paracentral bulges affect the traversing nerve root (takes its name from the vertebral body BELOW that level).

14436,230652,You review a 32-year-old man with a history of alcohol abuse. You notice the presence of a series of distended and engorged veins radiating out from his umbilical area.

Caput medusae is the name given to the appearance of distended superficial epigastric veins radiating out from the umbilicus across the abdomen. It is caused by the presence of portal hypertension, usually due to liver failure.
The hepatic portal vein is the major vein of the hepatic portal venous system and carries blood from the gastrointestinal tract and spleen to the liver.
The hepatic portal venous system communicates with the systemic venous system in the following locations:
Oesophageal veins
Para-umbiical veins
Retroperitoneal veins
Rectal veins
When blood flow through the portal system is obstructed, for example due to cirrhosis, thrombosis or the presence of a tumour, pressure rises within the portal system. In these circumstances, portal hypertension develops (a portal venous pressure of >20 mmHg) and these anatomoses become congested and form venous dilatations.
An overview of the main porto-systemic anastomoses and their associated clinical conditions is given in the table below:
  Portal circulation Systemic circulation Clinical condition
Left gastric vein Azygous vein Oesophageal varices
Para-umbilical veins Inferior epigastric vein Caput medusae
Superior rectal vein Middle and inferior rectal veins Haemorrhoids",FALSE,"The correct answer is 3. Para-umbilical veins and superior epigastric vein.

This coronary artery variant is the most significant and likely to cause symptoms. It is often repaired even if not symptomatic, but always repaired if symptomatic as there is an associated with a significant risk of sudden cardiac death. It is known as a 'malignant' course.
  Hemiazygos continuation
This is a congenital anomaly usually consequent on failure of development of the infrahepatic IVC. Instead, blood below this level returns to the heart via a dilated hemiazygos vein which drains into the azygos vein at or above the level of the heart.

    PDA - patent ductus arteriosus
A PDA accounts for around one in ten cases of congenital heart disease. In a normal patient the duct will close within hours of birth but in duct-dependant circulations it may stay open for a few days before closing leading to an acute deterioration in the baby (classically around day 5 of life). Prostaglandins can be given to try to re-open the duct, or maintain what patency does exist at the time of presentation.

Select ONE answer only.,"SBA: Genito urinary, Adrenal, Obstetrics & Gynaecology and Breast",Choriocarcinoma,Teratoma,Yolk sac tumour,Sarcoidosis,Lymphoma,A,63%,9%,12%,13%,4%,"Explanation:
Cystic areas within a testicular mass are commonly seen in non-seminomatous germ cell tumours. Teratomas, yolk sac tumours, embryonal cell tumours and choriocarcinomas all fall into the category of non-seminomatous germ cell tumours. Of these, embryonal cell tumours make up the vast majority.
Sarcoidosis is part of the differential diagnosis for bilateral testicular masses. Although bilateral hilar lymph node enlargement does fit with sarcoidosis, the elevated hCG does not.
Choriocarcinoma
This is a rare tumour affecting 20-30-year-olds with rapid metastases to lung, liver, GI tract, brain. They often causes haemorrhage in both primary and metastatic lesions. They cause gynaecomastia in 10% of patients due to raised serum hCG.
Lymphoma and leukaemia
Testicular lymphoma is uncommon but important. In men over the age of 60 it is the most common testicular malignancy and in men of any age it is the most common bilateral testicular malignancy (although it is not always bilateral). On ultrasound it appears either as a diffusely hypoechoic and enlarged testicle or as multiple hypoechoic masses.
Testicular leukaemia has very similar appearances to lymphoma and may be difficult to differentiate from it.
Teratoma
This is the second most common tumour in boys under 5. aFP is usually normal. Under ultrasound it appears as a heterogenous complex mass.
Yolk sac tumour
This makes up 80% of childhood testicular tumours. They can often present as testicular enlargement without a focal mass. These metastasize to the lung which is the most common site of recurrent disease.
Embryonal cell tumour
This is the second most common testicular tumour. It is the most aggressive of all testicular tumours with visceral metastases being common and a 5 year survival of 30%.
  In reality, tumours are often mixed histological types in around 35% cases. Testicular tumours can also be diagnosed with a strong pre-test probability based solely on age as detailed in the table below. The role of the radiologist however does not need to be as complex as suggesting the final histological diagnosis. Establishing the presence of a testicular mass is sufficient.

10866,230652,A 55 female non-smoker is found to have numerous thin-walled cysts surrounded by normal lung parenchyma. The lung volumes are preserved. What is the most likely diagnosis?,SBA: Cardiothoracic and vascular,Lymphangioleiomyomatosis,Histiocytosis,Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis,Emphysema,RBILD,A,89%,7%,0%,2%,1%,"Explanation:
Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM)
LAM can go misdiagnosed for many years as emphysema. It occurs exclusively in non-smoking women of childbearing age and quite often a history of spontaneous pneumothorax is given. Radiologically there are numerous small cystic spaces surrounded by normal lung. A chylous pleural effusion (negative Hounsfield units) is reasonably specific. The main differential diagnosis would be histiocytosis which tends to be associated with smoking, classically spares the costophrenic angles and gives small nodules but both can present with spontaneous pneumothorax and give small cysts. The lung volumes in LAM will remain normal whereas they can be increased in Histiocytosis (surprisingly for a fibrotic lung disease).
  Histiocytosis (Langerhans cell histiocytosis - LCH)
There are three separate forms of this disease:
Eosinophilic granuloma (70%) – a limited version confined to the skeleton in children or young adults. Clinically presents as fever, raised WCC and ESR with painful bony lesions. In the skull these have a typical ‘beveled edge’ or ‘hole within a hole’ appearance or can be seen as a ‘button sequestrum’. In the spine it is one of the main causes of vertebra plana.
Hand-Schüller-Christian Disease (20%) – classically a triad of destructive bony lesions, diabetes insipidus and exophthalmos. In a quarter of these patients the lungs are involved with cyst formation and spontaneous pneumothoraces possible. Nodule formation, fibrosis and honeycombing are also seen.
Letterer-Siwe Disease (10%) – a fulminant multi-organ variant affecting very young infants
  There is a strong association with smoking for patients who develop pulmonary features of LCH. Heavy smoking causes an accumulation of Langerhans cells and hence, as with other inspiration-related lung diseases, there is a predilection for the upper zones. The Langerhans cells can collect with other cells and become small granulomas seen as small lung nodules. Despite being a type of fibrotic lung disease the lung volumes can be increased. Small lung cysts form and there is a risk of spontaneous pneumothorax. There is usually sparing of the costophrenic angles which can be a key finding..
  Emphysema
Many cystic lung diseases are often misdiagnosed initially as emphysema, largely due to the population prevalence of emphysema.
True lung cysts however have a perceptible wall whereas emphysematous spaces within lung tissue does not.
  Centrilobular emphysema – Caused by smoking. enlargement of the respiratory bronchiole, destruction of the alveolar septa, surrounded by normal lung, distal alveoli are spared. Affects the apical segments of each lobe due to higher ventilation perfusion ratios.
Panacinar emphysema – Caused by alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency. Affects the whole lung with greater severity seen at the bases where there is greater blood flow. Uniform lung destruction.
Paraseptal emphysema – characteristically subpleural. Associated with bullous formation and spontaneous pneumothorax.
  Respiratory Bronchiolitis Interstitial Lung disease (RBILD)
This condition is heavily associated with smoking and can be seen as centrilobular nodules with ground glass opacification. Appearances are often very similar to desquamative interstitial pneumonia. Patients can be relatively young.
  Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) also known as either Usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP) or cryptogenic fibrosing alveolitis (CFA)
This is classically a disease of previously fit middle aged men with a reasonably long (>6month) history of shortness of breath and cough. Volume loss is prevalent and there is a classical apico-basilar gradient meaning that the lower zones are much more affected than the upper zones.

10356,230652,A 61-year-old lady with a fatigue and weakness after minimal exertion undergoes a CXR which shows a widened mediastinum. A subsequent CT shows a lobulated 8cm anterior mediastinal mass with pleural deposits. What is the most likely diagnosis?,SBA: Cardiothoracic and vascular,Malignant thymoma,Hodgkin lymphoma,Malignant germ cell tumour,Lipoma,Non-Hodgkin lymphoma,A,74%,13%,7%,0%,6%,"Explanation:
The ‘5Ts’ of anterior mediastinal masses are a useful aide memoire:
Thymoma
Thyroid tumours
Teratoma
Thoracic aorta
Terrible lymphoma
  Malignant thymoma
These tumours spread by invading the mediastinum and encasing the lung with pleural thickening. Vascular invasion is also seen. There is an association with myasthenia gravis, hence the features of weakness and fatigue symptoms with lid lag and diplopia also commonly described. Pleural deposits are also a good feature to suggest a malignant thymoma over some of the other possible options.
  Hodgkin lymphoma
Hodgkin lymphoma has two age peaks in prevalence, one in the late 20s and one in the late 70s. It can present at any age however. If a histological finding of Reed-Sternberg cells (binucleate white cells) is given there can be no other diagnosis. Hodgkin lymphoma tends to cause anterior mediastinal masses whereas Non-hodgkin lymphoma tends to cause posterior mediastinal masses. Hodgkin lymphoma nodal involvement spreads contiguously from one region to the next. This makes the staging very easy to remember.
Stage I = one nodal group involved
Stage II = two or more nodal groups involved on the same side of the diaphragm
Stage III = nodal groups on either side of the diaphragm
Stage IV = involvement of non-lymphatic structures (e.g. bone or lung)
  Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL)
NHL is 4 times more prevalent than Hodgkin lymphoma. Thoracic lymph node enlargement is common and classically affects the posterior mediastinum. Unlike Hodgkin lymphoma, NHL demonstrates non-contiguous spread and thus the whole neck, chest, abdomen and pelvis should be included in staging imaging.
The following table summarises some of the imaging features separating the two diagnoses:

These include seminomas and non-seminomatous (embryonal, yolk sac, choriocarcinoma, mixed cell type) tumours. Generally speaking they affect young adults and an elevated hCG, LDH, or alpha fetoprotein is usually present. The presence of effusions suggests local pleural invasion and may well be seen. Although the presence or absence of calcification is not featured in this question, the lack of calcification is in-keeping with seminomatous tumours.

An increased resistive index is a sensitive finding for the presence of pathology but it is relatively non-specific.
  Renal vein thrombosis
Transplant kidneys are most likely to develop renal vein thrombosis within their first week. Clinically the patient will become anuric with a tender and swollen kidney. Ultrasound is the mainstay of diagnosis and can show thrombus within the renal vein, however the diagnosis is usually made on the basis of the Doppler findings. Since the outflow from the kidney is obstructed the resistive index (the difference in velocity between systole and diastole divided by the systolic velocity) will increase to above 0.7. The resistive index, however, is not specific as it also increases in renal artery stenosis. Furthermore the arterial waveform changes and there may even be reversal of end-diastolic flow in the renal artery. This is seen as inversion of the colour Doppler trace.
  Renal artery stenosis
There are three main aetiologies of renal artery stenosis. The most prevalent is atherosclerosis. Fibromuscular dysplasia is the second most common and is classically given as affecting a relatively young woman with beading (string of beads) of the mid and distal renal arteries seen, for which the management is angioplasty. Finally a small number of cases are secondary to a variety of conditions such as Buerger’s disease, Takayasu’s disease and neurofibromatosis.
The significance of diagnosis of atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis is in avoiding the use of ACE inhibitors. The ASTRAL trial showed that there was no long term benefit of stenting the stenoses over best medical management, although there was still a reduction in the number of episodes of flash pulmonary oedema experienced by the patients.
Slightly different numbers are given in the different sources.

Her mother reports she had been unwell with a chest infection for which she had only recently begun a course of antibiotics. A CXR shows a large but well defined mass in the left hemithorax. She is stabilized and taken for a CT scan. This reveals multiple cysts with hypoplasia of the surrounding left lung. The mass is causing contralateral shift of the mediastinum. What is the most likely diagnosis?,SBA: Paediatrics,Congenital pulmonary airway malformation,Congenital lobar overinflation,Tension pneumothorax,Swyer-James syndrome,Pulmonary interstitial emphysema,A,87%,6%,1%,5%,2%,"Explanation:
Congenital Pulmonary Airway Malformation (CPAM) – also known as Congenital cystic adenomatoid malformation (CCAM)
Although often an antenatal diagnosis, CPAM should be considered in the investigation of a neonatal respiratory distress. Milder cases can present later when the child develops a LRTI and decompensates. On investigation a cystic mass is discovered. The size of the cysts denotes the type with Type I accounting for half of cases and comprising a smaller number of larger (>20mm) cysts. Type III is more sponge-like with cysts measuring only a couple of mm and Type II is between the two. Where cysts are larger, air-fluid levels may be seen. The malformation can exert a mass effect, causing both hypoplasia of the remainder of the ipsilateral lung as well as contralateral mediastinal shift.
  Congenital lobar overinflation (previously congenital lobar emphysema)
This condition is thought to be caused by underdevelopment of bronchial cartilage in the affected lobe(s). Consequently the bronchus is unable to remain patent during expiration leading to significant air trapping. It is usually the left upper lobe which is affected but approximately 40% of cases involve the left upper lobe; the right middle or the right upper lobes are affected in a further 55% of cases. There is a reasonable male preponderance of approximately 3:1.
On a CXR there is hyperlucency of the affected lobe and often mass effect on the mediastinum leading to contralateral mediastinal shift and thereby respiratory distress.
  Pulmonary interstitial emphysema (PIE)
As the name would suggest, this disease is diagnosed when there is air within the interstitial tissues of the lungs. It is caused by alveolar rupture due to the barotrauma of mechanical ventilation or positive airway pressure. It can be associated with hyaline membrane disease and is prevalent in infants of a low birth weight. Complications such as pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum can be severe and acutely life threatening. Radiographically there is hyperinflation and lucencies in either a cystic pattern or streaks emanating from the hila and following the direction of the bronchi/bronchioles. It is treated with high frequency oscillation ventilation which is less traumatic to the lungs.
  Swyer-James syndrome
In this condition, normal development of the infant lung is impeded by bronchiolitis (viral or mycoplasma) at an early age, with superadded acute airspace destruction. Consequently the affected lobe is small and lucent on the CXR due to air trapping. It is a differential diagnosis for a unilateral lucent hemithorax, along with a pneumothorax, very large pulmonary emboli and causes of decreased chest wall musculature such as Poland syndrome or, historically, polio. In an an exam situation Swyer-James syndrome is usually given as a teenage or young adult patient with a history of recurrent LRTIs. Air trapping, and bronchiectasis can also be described.
  Tension pneumothorax
This must be ruled out for any patient presenting with acute respiratory distress. The presence of lung markings, even if scarce, ought to rule this out although the difference between ‘scarce’ and ‘absent’ is undoubtedly easier to interpret on a real CXR as opposed to a wooly description of one.",TRUE,"Congenital pulmonary airway malformation (CPAM) is the most likely diagnosis in this case.

Craniosynostosis
Premature closure of one or more of the sutures leads to an abnormal shape to the head developing as the brain continues to grow within a confined space. Skull growth will continue perpendicular to the affected suture. Skull x-rays can be performed (Townes, AP and lateral views) but CT scanning offers 3-D reconstruction capabilities and is usually performed prior to any surgery for the purposes of planning.
Of these by far the most common is sagittal craniosynostosis which causes elongation of the skull and is termed scaphocephaly meaning 'boat-like'.
  Suture Age of Closure Craniosynostosis
Metopic (5%) 3-9m Trigonocephaly

The clinical team asks what she should do about breast-feeding her 3-month-old daughter. What should you advise? Select ONE answer only.","SBA: Genito urinary, Adrenal, Obstetrics & Gynaecology and Breast",No breast-feeding interruption is necessary,She should switch to formula feeding,She should 'pump-and-dump' for 24 hours,She should 'pump-and-dump' for 6 hours,She should 'pump-and-dump' for one week,A,72%,1%,23%,4%,1%,"Explanation:
Considerations during lactation
Less than 1% of injected iodine or gadolinium is excreted into breast milk and less than 1% of this is then absorbed by the baby's intestinal tract. Although these amounts are considered acceptably low as to not necessitate any breast-feeding cessation advice many families are understandably over-cautious. It is accepted that contrast agents are undetectable in blood 24 hours after administration and so any mother wishing to 'pump-and-dump' despite the negligible risks need not do so for longer than a day. Care should, however, be given to counsel the family that it is possible for inadvertent weaning to occur even after short intervals and this should be factored in to any decision made by the family.
Following a nuclear medicine study the risks to the baby are two-fold; firstly from tracer excretion into the breast milk, but also through proximity to the mother during breast-feeding. Recommendations for breast-feeding interruption vary depending on the half-life of the tracer used. For perfusion imaging using technetium (half-life 6 hours) breast milk should be expressed for the first 24 hours following the scan. In theory, it need not be discarded but can safely be bottle-fed to the baby after these 24 hours have elapsed, however in practice many patients none-the-less choose to discard it.
Most tracers simply require adherence to a washout time but of note, the precautions following administration of Gallium-67 based tracers (most commonly used for pyrexia of unknown origin) are much more limiting and, practically speaking, unfortunately lead to complete cessation of breastfeeding. The half-life of Ga-67 is approximately 78 hours. Breastfeeding should, if time allows, be stopped for 2-4 weeks prior to the scan to allow the breast tissue to become less radiosensitive while the tracer circulates within the mother. Where this is an unacceptably long delay for the clinical state of the patient the study can be performed straight away anyway but in either case, milk should also be discarded for at least a further two weeks following the study. Clearly a disruption to breast-feeding of such a long time is far from ideal, even assuming that a patient who is sufficiently unwell as to need a PUO study is able to continue breast-feeding at all, and is likely to lead to complete cessation of breast-feeding. There are other ways to image PUO using Tc99m labelled white blood cells which can be considered.
  Imaging in pregnant patients (for PE)
A pregnant patient suspected to have a pulmonary embolus should undergo a chest x-ray to look for alternative causes of shortness of breath such as a lower respiratory tract infection, pleural effusions or a pneumothorax. In the event that they go on to have a VQ scan a chest radiograph is required for comparison.
Thereafter the patient should undergo bilateral lower limb venous dopplers if they have signs or symptoms of deep vein thrombosis. Around a third of pregnant patients who develop pulmonary emboli will have a deep vein thrombosis and for these patients treatment can be started on the basis of their DVT diagnosis without the need for further imaging. If the patient has no signs or symptoms of a DVT, they should proceed to a VQ scan or a CTPA.
The patient should be counselled that there is a small increase in the absolute risk of the foetus developing a childhood cancer following a maternal VQ scan but also that the absolute risk of maternal breast cancer is reduced compared to a CTPA.
CTPA
CTPA imaging confers a lower dose to the foetus than V/Q scanning, although this effect is diminished in the third trimester as the gravid uterus becomes closer to the field of view.
Unfortunately however, CTPA confers a far greater dose to the breast tissue of the mothers at a time when the tissue is more radiosensitive than it would otherwise be in a non-pregnant woman.
A secondary consideration is the use of iodinated contrast. Iodine crosses the placenta and is excreted by the foetal kidneys into the amniotic fluid. Babies of mothers who have received iodinated contrast during pregnancy should be tested during their first week of life for thyroid suppression although there is little evidence in literature to suggest that many if any infants have developed hypothyroidism following maternal intravenous iodine exposure.
Technical factors to performing a CTPA scan in pregnant patients, if required, are also important to consider. Hyperdynamic circulation can render usual triggering bolus mechanisms suboptimal and raise the possibility of a non-diagnostic study.
  V/Q or Q only scanning
V/Q scanning confers a far lower breast dose to the mother but the dose to the foetus, particularly when small, can be greater owing to tracer accumulation within the solid organs of the mother. The mother should be encouraged to adequately hydrate and void frequently in the subsequent hours/days following a scan.
Many institutes choose to perform perfusion scanning only in pregnant women on the understanding that if the perfusion scan is normal then there is no need to go on to perform the ventilation study. The perfusion scan can also be performed at half the usual dose to further reduce the foetal-dose. Naturally doing so comes with the trade-off of lower sensitivity and specificity.
  Gadolinium in pregnancy
Gadolinium also crosses the placenta and is excreted by the foetus into the amniotic fluid. The chelated form of gadolinium in itself poses no risk to the foetus however the free form of gadolinium is teratogenic and the longer the foetus is exposed to the chelated gadolinium administered for the scan, the greater the risk of each molecule of gadolinium becoming dissociated from its chelate. For this reason therefore, gadolinium should only be administered in a patient known to be pregnant, if there is likely to be significant diagnostic benefit from the resultant images.",TRUE,"I chose number 3 because no breast-feeding interruption is necessary. The CTPA study does not involve any radiation, so there is no need for the mother to stop breast-feeding her daughter. In addition, the CTPA study does not involve any contrast agents, so there is no need for the mother to ""pump-and-dump"" her breast milk.",2,"3. A question about ethical decision making.

Diverticular disease is the most common cause of a colovesical fistula and of the inflammatory bowel diseases Crohn disease is more often complicated by fistula formation than is ulcerative colitis.
Gas within the bladder should be obvious on a CT scan. Often this will be for as innocuous a reason as a recent urethral catheterisation but, especially in diabetic patients, it can also be a sign of infection, either emphysematous cystitis or emphysematous pyelonephritis (see below), with a gas-forming organism such as E-coli.
The absence of gas in the bladder does not rule out a fistula and if there is clinical or radiological suspicion the presence of a fistula can be confirmed with a barium enema. Other causes of a colovesical fistula other than those listed as alternative answers include post-radiotherapy complications, abdominal sepsis (such as an appendix abscess), and finally trauma.
  Emphysematous Pyelonephritis
The radiological appearances of this condition are very striking, particularly on CT where streaky or lobulated gas can be seen in the renal parenchyma and perirenal tissues. On ultrasound the gas causes ring-down artefacts and is sometime described as giving a ‘dirty shadowing’ appearance. It is a very important diagnosis to make since it comes with significant morbidity. E-coli is the usual culprit and a history of poorly controlled diabetes is usual.

The left coronary artery arises from the aorta above the left cusp of the aortic valve. It supplies the left atrium, left ventricle, intraventricular septum and part of the left branch bundle of His. It is larger than the right coronary artery.
It passes between the left side of the pulmonary trunk and the left auricle and then bifurcates into the left anterior descending artery (LAD), which is also called the anterior interventricular branch, and the left circumflex artery (LCA). Sometimes an additional artery arises at the bifurcation called the ramus or intermediate artery.
The LAD follows the anterior interventricular groove towards the apex of the heart and then continues to the posterior surface of the heart to anastamose with the posterior interventricular branch.
The LCA follows the anterior atrioventricular groove to the left border of the heart and then proceeds to the posterior surface. It then gives rise to the left marginal branch, which follows the left border of the heart.
The right coronary artery arises above the right cusp of the aortic valve. It supplies the right atrium, the SA and AV nodes and the posterior part of the interventricular septum.
It runs along the right atrioventricular groove before branching. The right marginal artery arises first and then the right coronary artery continues on to the posterior surface of the heart, still running in the right atrioventricular groove.

The admitting team suspect she may have a pulmonary embolism. Which of the following is INCORRECT? Select ONE answer only.,"SBA: Genito urinary, Adrenal, Obstetrics & Gynaecology and Breast",The breast dose to the mother from a V/Q scan is usually greater than for a CTPA scan,The baby should have a thyroid function test during its first week of life if the patient does have a CTPA,Hyperdynamic circulation increases the risk of a non-diagnostic study for pregnant patients,Iodine crosses the placenta and is excreted into the amniotic fluid by the foetus,The foetal dose from a V/Q scan is usually greater than for a CTPA scan,A,76%,7%,4%,3%,10%,"Explanation:
Please note that the question asks which answer is INCORRECT.
A pregnant patient suspected to have a pulmonary embolus should undergo a chest x-ray to look for alternative causes of shortness of breath such as a lower respiratory tract infection, pleural effusions or a pneumothorax. In the event that they go on to have a VQ scan a chest radiograph is required for comparison.
Thereafter the patient should undergo bilateral lower limb venous dopplers if they have signs or symptoms of deep vein thrombosis. Around a third of pregnant patients who develop pulmonary emboli will have a deep vein thrombosis and for these patients treatment can be started on the basis of their DVT diagnosis without the need for further imaging. If the patient has no signs or symptoms of a DVT, they should proceed to a VQ scan or a CTPA.
The patient should be counselled that there is a small increase in the absolute risk of the foetus developing a childhood cancer following a maternal VQ scan but also that the absolute risk of maternal breast cancer is reduced compared to a CTPA.
  CTPA
CTPA imaging confers a lower dose to the foetus than V/Q scanning, although this effect is diminished in the third trimester as the gravid uterus becomes closer to the field of view.
Unfortunately however, CTPA confers a far greater dose to the breast tissue of the mothers at a time when the tissue is more radiosensitive than it would otherwise be in a non-pregnant woman.
A secondary consideration is the use of iodinated contrast. Iodine crosses the placenta and is excreted by the foetal kidneys into the amniotic fluid. Babies of mothers who have received iodinated contrast during pregnancy should be tested during their first week of life for thyroid suppression although there is little evidence in literature to suggest that many if any infants have developed hypothyroidism following maternal intravenous iodine exposure.
Technical factors to performing a CTPA scan in pregnant patients, if required, are also important to consider. Hyperdynamic circulation can render usual triggering bolus mechanisms suboptimal and raise the possibility of a non-diagnostic study.
  V/Q or Q only scanning
V/Q scanning confers a far lower breast dose to the mother but the dose to the foetus, particularly when small, can be greater owing to tracer accumulation within the solid organs of the mother. The mother should be encouraged to adequately hydrate and void frequently in the subsequent hours/days following a scan.
Many institutes choose to perform perfusion scanning only in pregnant women on the understanding that if the perfusion scan is normal then there is no need to go on to perform the ventilation study. The perfusion scan can also be performed at half the usual dose to further reduce the foetal-dose. Naturally doing so comes with the trade-off of lower sensitivity and specificity.
  Gadolinium in pregnancy
Gadolinium also crosses the placenta and is excreted by the foetus into the amniotic fluid. The chelated form of gadolinium in itself poses no risk to the foetus however the free form of gadolinium is teratogenic and the longer the foetus is exposed to the chelated gadolinium administered for the scan, the greater the risk of each molecule of gadolinium becoming dissociated from its chelate. For this reason therefore, gadolinium should only be administered in a patient known to be pregnant, if there is likely to be significant diagnostic benefit from the resultant images.
  Considerations during lactation
Less than 1% of injected iodine or gadolinium is excreted into breast milk and less than 1% of this is then absorbed by the baby's intestinal tract. Although these amounts are considered acceptably low as to not necessitate any breast-feeding cessation advice many families are understandably over-cautious. It is accepted that contrast agents are undetectable in blood 24hours after administration and so any mother wishing to 'pump-and-dump' despite the negligible risks need not do so for longer than a day. Care should, however, be given to counsel the family that it is possible for inadvertent weaning to occur even after short intervals and this should be factored in to any decision made by the family.
Following a nuclear medicine study the risks to the baby are two-fold; firstly from tracer excretion into the breast milk, but also through proximity to the mother during breast-feeding. Recommendations for breast-feeding interruption vary depending on the half-life of the tracer used. For perfusion imaging using technetium (half-life 6 hours) breast milk should be expressed for the first 24 hours following the scan. In theory, it need not be discarded but can safely be bottle-fed to the baby after these 24 hours have elapsed, however in practice many patients none-the-less choose to discard it.
Most tracers simply require adherence to a washout time but of note, the precautions following administration of Gallium-67 based tracers (most commonly used for pyrexia of unknown origin) are much more limiting and, practically speaking, unfortunately lead to complete cessation of breastfeeding. The half-life of Ga-67 is approximately 78 hours. Breastfeeding should, if time allows, be stopped for 2-4 weeks prior to the scan to allow the breast tissue to become less radiosensitive while the tracer circulates within the mother. Where this is an unacceptably long delay for the clinical state of the patient the study can be performed straight away anyway but in either case, milk should also be discarded for at least a further two weeks following the study. Clearly a disruption to breast-feeding of such a long time is far from ideal, even assuming that a patient who is sufficiently unwell as to need a PUO study is able to continue breast-feeding at all, and is likely to lead to complete cessation of breast-feeding. There are other ways to image PUO using Tc99m labelled white blood cells which can be considered.",FALSE,"I chose this answer because it is incorrect. Iodine does not cross the placenta and is not excreted into the amniotic fluid by the foetus. Instead, iodine is absorbed by the placenta and is then filtered out of the mother's bloodstream by the kidneys.",2,"3. A question about medical ethics or legal matters.

Sarcoidosis
Although only a small percentage of sarcoid patients develop CNS signs these are classical, with multiple cranial neuropathies, meningeal and pituitary involvement.
What separates sarcoid meningitis from tuberculous meningitis which would probably be the best other option is the nodular enhancement.
Both tuberculous and fungal meningitis also affect the basal cisterns and both have the propensity to cause an obstructing hydrocephalus secondary to debris.
Carcinomatous meningitis commonly derives from breast cancer, although lung cancer and melanoma are other possibilities. There is a classic description of ‘zuckerguss’ (sugar coating) where thin areas of subarachnoid enhancement follow the gyral convolutions. Leptomeningeal nodularity is also seen, hence the inclusion here as a possible answer, however the patient demographic fits better with sarcoidosis.
HIV encephalitis causes cognitive problems leading to a dementia.

This presents between two weeks and two months of life as an obstructive jaundice picture (i.e. conjugated hyperbilirubinaemia). The extrahepatic bile ducts have become fibrosed and cause obstruction. Initial investigation is usually with ultrasound and an echogenic ‘triangular cord’ structure in the porta hepatitis is considered pathognomic. The gallbladder may be normal, small or non-visualised and therefore contributes little to the diagnosis. Further investigation is often with a HIDA scan.

**Please note the question asks for the answer most likely to be caused by an ACCIDENTAL injury**
  Spiral fractures can be caused by both accidental and non-accidental injuries but are more common in adults than children. Significant power is needed to cause a spiral fracture in a child; they are unusual in the setting of a straightforward fall.
  Non-accidental injury
It is the responsibility of all members of the healthcare profession to be alert to the possibility of non-accidental injury. For radiologists, there are specific findings which should alert the reporter to the possibility of non-accidental injury. These include:
Lower limb injuries in a non-ambulant child
Discrepancy between the history and apparent injuries
Delay seeking medical attention
Metaphyseal fractures (corner or bucket-handle)
Multiple fractures of different ages
Scapula fractures
Posterior rib fractures
Sternal fractures
Skull fractures (especially non-parietal, or crossing sutures)
  It is important to appreciate that any fracture (not just the ones listed above) can be caused by non-accidental injury.

The x-ray does show a lesion and the girl goes on to have a resection of the terminal phalanx of the left index finger. Histological analysis of the lesion proves it to be avascular. What is the most likely diagnosis?,SBA: Paediatrics,Subungual exostosis,Glomus tumour,Subungual keratoacanthoma,Enchondroma,Benign naevus,A,40%,13%,38%,8%,1%,"Explanation:
Subungual exostosis
An exostosis is a bony outgrowth from an otherwise normal bone. Crucially there is cortical and medullary continuity from the parent bone to within the exostosis. They can arise following trauma to the bone and are often found in the adolescent age range.
  Subungual keratoacanthoma
Keratoacanthomas can occur anywhere in on the skin and consist of overgrowth of squamous epithelium with a central area of keratin. Local destruction can sometimes be seen and transformation into a squamous cell carcinoma can also occur. On x-ray a subungual keratoacanthoma will appear as a lucent lesion which, through mass effect only, has eroded the underlying bone but otherwise does not seem to affect the underlying bone (i.e. no sclerosis, no periosteal reaction). The peak demographic is men over the age of 55.
  Glomus tumour
These are benign vascular tumours which arise in patients in their 40s or 50s. They usually present as an exquisitely tender blue/red nodule under the patient’s finger nail. The Hildreth sign is present if the pain is relieved by applying a tourniquet proximal to the lesion. Usually they arise within soft tissue, however occasionally they can be found actually within the terminal phalanx itself where it can be mistaken for an enchondroma.
  Enchondroma
As the name suggests, this is a cartilage forming tumour showing ground-glass matrix and ring or arc calcifications (as with all cartilage forming tumours). Patients are typically young (10-30 years) and the lesions are typically found in the hands (although they can form anywhere in the body, in the hands they are unusual to be found in the terminal phalanges). They are thought to derive from ongoing growth of small foci of cartilage which have become displaced from the growth plate. They can expand the cortex but, unless presenting as a fracture, should be painless and therefore are often an incidental diagnosis. Although they are benign tumours, malignant degeneration to a chondrosarcoma can occur.

Select one answer only.,SBA: Cardiothoracic and vascular,Increased PSV at 100cm/s,RI >0.7,RI difference between the kidneys of >5%,Increased RAR of >3.5,Pulsus parvus et tardus waveform,A,53%,11%,15%,10%,11%,"Explanation:
There are three main aetiologies of renal artery stenosis. The most prevalent is atherosclerosis. Fibromuscular dysplasia is the second most common and is classically given as affecting a relatively young woman with beading (string of beads) of the mid and distal renal arteries seen, for which the management is angioplasty. Finally a small number of cases are secondary to a variety of conditions such as Buerger disease, Takayasu disease and neurofibromatosis.
The significance of diagnosis of atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis is in avoiding the use of ACE inhibitors. The ASTRAL trial showed that there was no long term benefit of stenting the stenoses over best medical management, although there was still a reduction in the number of episodes of flash pulmonary oedema experienced by the patients.
There is conflicting literature about the use of resistive index in evaluating for renal artery stenosis in transplant kidneys. The normal value is around 0.7. Some studies have shown figures slightly higher than this (around 0.78) in mild-moderate renal artery stenosis but lower (0.6) in severe renal artery stenosis and in native kidneys studies have shown high resistive indices (above 0.7) to be associated with parenchymal scarring indicating the kidney may respond poorly to revascularisation therapy and resistive index is used to help inform treatment decisions on this basis. It is generally thought not to be a useful marker for diagnosis in renal artery stenosis though, in either native or transplant kidneys.

Tuberculous spondylitis also known as Pott disease
Around half of patients have no pulmonary disease and spondylitis accounts for around 5% of all infections with tuberculosis. The L1 vertebral body is the most commonly affected level but usually more than one levels is affected. Within the vertebral body it is the anterior aspect which is affected first. This is thought to be due to the subligamentous spread of the bacterium, under the anterior longitudinal ligament. The disc height is usually preserved until relatively late on in the disease which can make the condition very difficult to detect on x-ray since neither periosteal reactions nor reactive sclerosis are likely to be seen either. Calcification to the disc is common though, and virtually pathognomonic when present.
  Phemister triad
Of articular tuberculosis it is the spine which is most commonly affected however the hips and knees can also be affected. The Phemister triad describes three classical features of tuberculous arthropathy which are common to all the joints affected:
Juxta-articular osteoporosis
Marginal erosions
Gradual reduction of the joint space
Differentiating tuberculous spondylitis from pyogenic spondylitis is crucial and there are a number of features which can help.
  Tuberculous discitis
Staphylococcal discitis

12621,230652,A 45-year-old man with HIV has an MRI which shows ring enhancing lesions and leptomeningeal enhancement. What is the most likely diagnosis?,SBA: Central Nervous and Head & Neck,Cerebral tuberculosis,HIV encephalitis,Toxoplasmosis,Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy,Cryptococcus,A,41%,2%,39%,1%,17%,"Explanation:
Cerebral tuberculosis
A cerebral tuberculoma would be difficult to differentiate from toxoplasmosis or lymphoma. Classically though they are described as target lesions situated in the corticomedullary regions. They can calcify with treatment which would differentiate them well from other CNS infections. In this particular case the co-existent meningeal enhancement suggests the answer to beTB.
  Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML)
This is a JC virus mediated phenomenon which causes asymmetrical patchy white matter changes. These can be bilateral. The testable feature is involvement of the cortical U-fibres which separates it from HIV encephalopathy where the U-fibres are spared. The lack of a mass effect helps differentiate both PML and HIV encephalopathy from toxoplasmosis, cryptococcus and tuberculomas.
  HIV encephalopathy
Separating HIV encephalitis from PML can challenging in real life. HIV encephalitis causes bilateral symmetrical white matter changes, seen as high T2 signal (The T1 sequences can be normal). There is also sparing of the subcortical U-fibres.
  Cryptococcus
This is an opportunistic yeast-like fungus which therefore requires a degree of immunocompromise, typically AIDS. The cryptococcomas are non-enhancing low density lesions in the basal ganglia. These show as high signal on T2 sequences. A granulomatous meningitis can also occur. They can be differentiated from VR spaces on FLAIR where VR spaces will suppress (being CSF in content) whereas the mucoid cryptococcomas will not.
  Toxoplasmosis
Toxoplasmosis is a more common finding in AIDS patients than lymphoma is, by a large margin. On MRI it is seen as multiple ring enhancing lesions, which can show haemorrhage particularly following treatment. One of the stronger differentiators between toxoplasmosis and lymphoma is the SPECT findings. This is sometimes termed ‘hypometabolic’ meaning the lesions do not demonstrate SPECT uptake. The table below gives some general features of the two conditions. There is however considerable overlap in the imaging features despite these broad trends.

 ",FALSE,"HIV encephalitis is the most likely diagnosis in this case because it is the most common cause of ring-enhancing lesions and leptomeningeal enhancement in HIV-positive patients. HIV encephalitis is an opportunistic infection caused by the virus itself, and it can cause significant neurologic symptoms and cognitive impairment. Other possible diagnoses, such as toxoplasmosis, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, cerebral tuberculosis, and cryptococcus, can also cause similar symptoms, but they are less common in HIV-positive patients.",2,,B,FALSE,,C,FALSE,B

There are a number of features which can help differentiate between an osteoporotic vertebral collapse and a metastatic one.
  Favours osteoporosis
Favours metastases
Retropulsed bony fragments
Convex posterior cortex
Fluid adjacent to the fractured end plates
Associated soft tissue masses

Low but enhances with Gadolinium High (fluid)
Blastic metastases (prostate, breast, TCC) and myelofibrosis
Low Low
  Metastases
Normally metastatic deposits in the spine lead to low T1 signal and high T2 signal. There should be no signal drop out on fat saturated sequences in contrast to marrow reconversion where although red marrow will experience far less signal dropout than yellow marrow, there will still be some loss in signal owing to the fat content of both types of marrow.
Sclerotic or blastic metastases return little signal on either T1 or T2 weighted sequences. These include prostate, breast or TCC metastases among others.
Breast cancer can cause lytic or sclerotic metastases or a mixed picture.
Lytic metastases are more likely than sclerotic metastases to enhance with contrast. Similarly on DWI imaging, whereas lytic metastases will usually appear hyperintense, sclerotic metastases return little signal since they contain little water.
If there is a diffuse abnormality of the bone marrow it can be difficult to identify but normal bone marrow should not be lower in signal intensity than the muscle on T1 weighted sequences.",FALSE,"A high T1 and intermediate T2 signal of the bone marrow is indicative of normal bone marrow, which is generally less likely in a pathological fracture. A pathological fracture is more likely to be associated with low T1 and high T2 signal of the bone marrow, which is indicative of abnormal bone marrow. Retropulsed bony fragments, fluid adjacent to the end-plates, high T2 signal in the pedicles, and multiple compressed levels are all indicative of a pathological fracture.",2,"This question falls under category 2: A question about clinical judgement, what is the correct diagnosis?",B,TRUE,,A,TRUE,A

Select ONE answer only.",SBA: Musculoskeletal and Trauma,Coronal SIJs - best sequence for the SIJs,STIR - best sequence for bony erosions,T2 - best sequence for bone marrow abnormalities,Axial SIJs - to evaluate facet joints,Sagittal spine - to evaluate disc herniation,A,87%,4%,3%,3%,3%,"Explanation:
T1 fat sat - useful for visualisation of bony erosions and new bone formation
T1 fat sat post contrast - useful for detecting bone marrow abnormalities (but so is STIR, so contrast is not an absolute requirement for imaging ankylosing spondylitis).
STIR - useful for detecting bone marrow abnormalities in the SIJs and spine
T2 fat sat - useful for detecting oedema
  Coronal SIJ - ideally this should be taken parallel to the long axis of the sacrum, the better to view the SIJs, both SIJs can be seen on each image for comparison.
Axial SIJ - ideally this should be at 90 degrees to the modified coronal plane and is used to evaluate the ligamentous portion of the SIJs.
Axial spine - useful if co-existing disc herniation present but not ordinarily included otherwise
Sagittal spine - useful to evaluate facet and costovertebral joints
  Ankylosing spondylitis
This disease usually presents in early adulthood with gradual onset of back pain. There is a male preponderance, though it can affect women too. The vast majority (>90%) of patients are HLA-B27 positive. Radiologically the late features are classical with:
Bilateral symmetrical sacroiliitis
Enthesopathy - calcified tendon insertion sites
Bamboo spine - vertebral syndesmophytes, particularly in the thoracolumbar spine
Dagger sign - spinous process fusion
Erosion, then fusion at the symphysis pubis, costochondral, costovertebral and sternoclavicular joints
Thoracic manifestations: upper lobe pulmonary fibrosis, pericarditis, aortic root dilatation
Early features are far more subtle and require a higher index of suspicion
Enthesopathy - high signal on MRI at tendon insertion sites
Romanus lesions - triangular shaped oedema at the corners of vertebral bodies
Andersson lesions - bony oedema in the vertebral bodies adjacent to the disks.
Oedema in the sacroiliac joints.
  Patients with advanced ankylosing spondylitis are at increased risk of pathological fractures due to fusion. These can be pelvic fractures following a simple fall, or chance fractures of the spine (involving all three columns - in ankylosing spondylitis, these fractures are also sometimes termed chalk-stick or carrot fractures).",TRUE,"I chose this answer because coronal SIJs are the best sequence for evaluating the sacroiliac joints in ankylosing spondylitis. The coronal plane is most useful for visualizing the SIJs because it provides a direct view of the articular surfaces of the joint and allows for assessment of bony erosions, joint narrowing, and other signs of inflammation. Additionally, the coronal plane is also useful for evaluating the facet joints which can be affected in ankylosing spondylitis.",1,"3.

10331,230652,A 56-year-old man complaining of chest pain undergoes a CT chest that shows a hilar mass measuring 60HU which demonstrates no enhancement post-contrast. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?,SBA: Cardiothoracic and vascular,Atypical carcinoid,Carcinoid,Lymphoma,Duplication cyst,Neurofibroma,A,40%,10%,13%,29%,8%,"Explanation:
Carcinoid
These are low-grade lung malignancies with a good prognosis. They are usually central in location (in contrast to the peripheral preferences of hamartomas). Calcification is a common feature in approximately a third of cases which in this question is weakly suggested by the high attenuation. Typically carcinoids are very vascular tumours that enhance avidly, and usually derive their blood supply from the bronchial arteries rather than the pulmonary arteries. Atypical carcinoids can show little enhancement and also tend to be less well rounded and more aggressive in appearance, although that has not been suggested here.
The carcinoid syndrome seen in abdominal carcinoids is far less commonly seen with thoracic carcinoids. Wheezing, on the other hand, can be given in an exam question setting as a feature to point towards endobronchial carcinoid lesions (i.e. mechanical obstruction).
  Lymphoma
Lymphoma would be unlikely owing to the lack of enhancement.
  Duplication cyst
A duplication cyst would have a much lower HU than 60 – it would be expected to be far closer to zero.
  Neurofibroma
Although neurofibromas often show little enhancement on CT post contrast, again 60HU would be too high for most neurofibromas. Additionally a neurofibroma would more usually be described as having an intraspinal element. Dumbbell protrusion through the neural foramina.",FALSE,"I chose this answer because lymphoma is a type of cancer that can present as a hilar mass on a CT chest.

    Mesoblastic nephroma
This is the most common solid mass in a neonate and 90% of them are diagnosed within the first year of life. Presentation is usually as an abdominal mass. On ultrasound there will be a large hypoechoic renal mass which cannot clearly be separated from the normal renal parenchyma. Pertinent negative imaging features of note are the lack of invasion into the collecting system and lack of venous invasion, the latter in particular helps to differentiate it from a WIlms tumour.
  Multicystic dysplastic kidney
A Multicystic Dysplastic kidney is the second most common cause of a neonatal renal mass. The normal renal architecture is entirely replaced by a non-functioning mass of cysts separated from one another by fibrous tissue. The overall appearance is said to resemble a bunch of grapes. If unilateral, the condition can be asymptomatic or can present as recurrent urinary tract infections. The most important distinction to make is from hydronephrosis which is overall the most common cause of a neonatal abdominal mass. In hydronephrosis the apparent 'cysts' will communicate whereas in multicystic dysplastic kidney the cysts are separate from one another.

  Multilocular cystic nephroma
There are two age peaks for this tumour; one at around age 4 which affects mostly boys and and one at around age 40 which affects mostly women. In young boys the most common presentation is of a painless abdominal mass with or without other features such as haematuria and urinary tract infections. On ultrasound there will be a mass of cysts but importantly they will be surrounded by a thick fibrous capsule. Protrusion into the renal pelvis is also a key finding, but this is also seen in some WIlms tumours. There shouldn't be a solid component to this mass but enhancement of the septae separating the cysts may be seen on cross-sectional imaging.
  Neuroblastoma
This is the most common solid abdominal mass in infants and second most common in children of all ages (after Wilms tumours). Most are adrenal in location, around a third develop in the retroperitoneum and a fifth are located in the posterior mediastinum. Presentation can be with abdominal pain, a mass, or a fever. Most (95%) secrete catecholamines such as VMA (vanillylmandelic acid – leads to hypertension) or VIP (vasoactive intestinal polypeptides – leads to watery diarrhoea). There are also a few distinct clinical syndromes which herald the presence of a neuroblastoma.
  Syndrome
Details
Blueberry muffin syndrome
Metastatic cutaneous deposits
Opsomyoclonus
Rapid jerky eye movements and myoclonic jerks of the legs. This occurs in around 2% of neuroblastoma cases but around 50% of patients with opsomyoclonus have a neuroblastoma.
Hutchinson syndrome
Limping due to bony metastases
    On imaging they appear as a very large abdominal mass with or without speckled calcification within in. The kidney can either be invaded or just displaced inferiorly, causing a ‘drooping lily’ appearance on urography (where contrast within the inferiorly displaced renal calyces has the appearance of a lily flower with its head hanging down). Neuroblastomas tend to encase large vessels such as the IVC, as opposed to displacing them as Wilms tumours are prone to doing. Staging is performed with an 123I-MIBG scan (as opposed to a 99mTc-MDP bone scan) and importantly within the staging it is actually stage IVs (disease involving the skin, bone marrow and liver) which has the best prognosis.

Select ONE answer only.,SBA: Gastrointestinal,Transverse mesocolon,Small intestine mesentery,Sigmoid mesocolon,Mesoappendix,Mesorectum,A,69%,30%,0%,1%,1%,"Explanation:
The mesenteries are double layers of peritoneum in the abdominal cavity that are continuations of the visceral and parietal peritoneum. They enclose the intestines and attach them to the posterior abdominal wall.
The term was originally used only to refer to the small intestine mesentery that suspends the jejunum and ileum. For this reason the small intestine mesentery is sometimes referred to as the mesentery proper.
The term has now been widened to include four main mesenteries:
Small intestine mesentery (mesentery proper)
Transverse mesocolon
Sigmoid mesocolon
Mesoappendix
  The small intestine mesentery is a large, broad, fan-shaped mesentery that is attached to the jejunum and ileum, connecting them to the posterior wall of the abdominal cavity. Superiorly the root of the mesentery is attached to the duodenojejunal junction just to the left of the L2 vertebra. It runs obliquely downwards, from left to right, to attach inferiorly to the ileocaecal junction close to the right sacroiliac joint.
In the region of the root of the small intestine mesentery there are numerous Pacinian corpuscles (encapsulated mechanoreceptors). Traction and tension on the peritoneal folds in the upper abdomen stimulates these mechanoreceptors to produce a drop in blood pressure. This is thought to serve as a protective function by causing reflex contraction of the abdominal wall to aid support of the viscera during extreme movements.
The transverse mesocolon is a broad fold of peritoneum that is attached to the transverse colon and connects it to the posterior abdominal wall. It lies anteriorly across the front of the head and body of the pancreas to enclose the transverse colon. It subdivides the greater sac into the supracolic and infracolic compartments, which lie superior and inferior to the transverse mesocolon respectively.
The sigmoid mesocolon is an inverted V-shaped fold of peritoneum that attaches the sigmoid colon to the pelvic wall. The apex of the V is attached near to the bifurcation of the left common iliac artery. The left limb descends medially to the medial border of the left psoas major muscle and the right limb descends into the pelvis to end anteriorly to the S3 vertebra.
The mesoappendix is a fold of peritoneum around the vermiform appendix. It is attached to the lower end of the small intestine mesentery, near to the ileocaecal juntion. It usually extends to the tip of the appendix.",TRUE,The transverse mesocolon is the mesentery that crosses the head and body of the pancreas anteriorly.

  A small amount of physics for imaging of patients with cardiac amyloidosis
Amyloid deposition leads to fibrosis and, as a general rule, fibrotic processes contain little water. On MRI scans therefore, most fibrotic entities return little signal on any sequence. Additionally, in many patients with amyloid cardiomyopathy, gadolinium washes out of the myocardium far faster than normally occurs. Both these features combine to the extent that the blood within the heart becomes very dark (due to higher than usual concentrations of gadolinium washed out from the myocardium) but at the same time the signal from the myocardium is very low due to the presence of fibrosis. Nulling the signal from the myocardium (to try to better visualise the affected areas of myocardium) therefore becomes difficult since the null point for both the blood pool and the myocardium is almost the same.
  SSFP or FSE - used to look for gross abnormalities in the whole chest, and to plan further cardiac views. Cine-SSFP used to look at ventricle and valve function, volume, mass and ejection fraction. Early post contrast T1 FSE sequences are useful to look for early hyperenhancement which is a sign of inflammation such as myocarditis or pericarditis. First-pass perfusion (can be FSE or GRE) sequences are not essential but can be useful to examine for peri-infarction ischaemia. The ischaemic areas are seen as dark against the enhancement of normal myocardium.
  GRE - used to examine delayed enhancement. Images taken around 15 minutes (10-20mins) after gadolinium is injected. Normal myocardium undergoes a rapid wash-in and wash-out of contrast, but abnormal myocardium has a slower wash-in and wash-out so is still enhancing at this time. Myocardial infarction can be seen as an area of delayed hyperenhancement, classically in a vascular territorial distribution and also classically involving the subendocardium (which is usually spared in non-ischaemic pathology). Delayed hyperenhancement in a pattern typical for ischaemia is highly sensitive for both chronic and acute myocardial infarction.",FALSE,I chose 4 because enhancement at 10 minutes post-contrast is not typically seen with sarcoidosis.

Functional imaging in dementia
Tc99m-HMPAO SPECT and 18F-FDG PET produce very similar patterns when used to image patients with cognitive decline however the latter is considered to have a greater sensitivity and specificity and is therefore preferred.
Two structures bear particular importance in the imaging of dementia; the precuneus and the cingulate gyrus. Both are best appreciated on sagittal views.
Precuneus: The precuneus is located on the medial surface of each hemisphere, in the posterior parietal lobe. It has functions in motor planning, working memory and also connections to the visual pathways.
        The cingulate gyrus: The cinculate gyrus is also located on the medial side of each hemisphere and runs anteroposteriorly just above the corpus callosum. The cingulate gyrus has complex functions to do with learning, emotional response and memory.
        Alzheimer's disease
The radiological findings of this well-known disease are diffuse sulcal and ventricular enlargement. There is a disproportionate effect to the anterior temporal lobes, hippocampi and sylvian fissures with sparing of the sensorimotor and visual cortices, thalami and cerebellum. Functional studies (Tc-HMPAO SPECT or F-18 FDG PET) show reduced uptake in the precuneus, posterior cingulate gyrus, frontal and temporoparietal lobes but with characteristic sparing of the sensorimotor cortex and basal ganglia bilaterally. Importantly there is also sparing of the occipital lobes, which helps differentiate it from Lewy body dementia where the occipital lobes are involved. Other differences between the two conditions are seen with specific dopamine transporter agent imaging techniques
  Lewy body dementia
There is a generalised decrease in cerebral volume (sparing the hippocampi). Temporo-parietal hypoperfusion on HMPAO Tc99m SPECT scanning is indicative of Lewy body dementia. Involvement of the occipital cortex, which is typically spared in Alzheimer’s disease, sets the two apart from one another on PET studies. The cingulate island sign has also been ascribed to Lewy body dementia, where there is preservation of metabolism in the mid-posterior cingulate gyrus. If present, this is said to be specific for Lewy body dementia.
  Vascular dementia
Technically vascular dementia presents as a step-wise decline due to the finite number of small vascular insults that take place. The imaging features should be fairly familiar to candidates from day to day reporting. There are multifocal bilateral white matter changes which can be seen on CT when severe. Inclusion of susceptibility weighted sequences on an MRI scan allows detection of microhaemorrhages suggestive of a parallel diagnosis of cerebral amyloid angiopathy where present.",TRUE,"I chose this answer because Lewy body dementia is a type of dementia that is characterized by the presence of Lewy bodies in the brain, which are abnormal clumps of proteins that are found in the occipital lobes. This can lead to reduced uptake of the occipital lobes, which is what is seen in the HMPAO images.",2,"This question falls under category 2: A question about clinical judgement, what is the correct diagnosis?",C,FALSE,,C,TRUE,A

Inflammation of the pericardium is termed pericarditis and leads to fibrous thickening. Most commonly this occurs either post-operatively in patients undergoing cardiac surgery or as an idiopathic entity although historically it was tuberculosis which was the most common cause of pericarditis. The diagnosis is predominantly clinical with symptoms such as malaise or dyspnoea and signs such as neck vein distension or paradoxical movement of the JVP. On cross sectional imaging thickening of the pericardium to greater than 2mm can be seen and the fibrosis causes a restriction in distensibility. The right ventricle, being more compliant than the left, becomes flattened and furthermore there can be curvature of the septum towards the left. Elsewhere, if the field of view permits, accessory signs such as pleural effusions and even ascites may be seen.",FALSE,"Non-Hodgkin lymphoma is the most likely diagnosis because the CXR and CT scan show tree-in-bud features, which are indicative of lymphoma.

A chest X-ray reveals a grossly widened mediastinum, deviation of the trachea to the right, and fractures of the first and second ribs.

Traumatic aortic rupture is a relatively common cause of sudden death following major trauma, particularly high-speed road traffic accidents (RTAs). Between 15-20% of deaths from RTAs are estimated to be due to this injury. Patients that survive the initial injury can make a full recovery if the aortic rupture is promptly recognized and treated.
Patients that survive tend to have an incomplete laceration near the ligamentum arteriosum of the aorta. Continuity is maintained by an intact adventitial layer or contained mediastinal haematoma that prevents immediate exsanguination and death.
It can be difficult to detect and may go unnoticed as many patients have no specific symptoms and other injuries may also be present clouding the picture.
Findings on chest X-ray can be helpful in making the diagnosis and include the following:
Fractures of 1st and 2nd ribs
Grossly widened mediastinum
Hazy left lung field
Obliteration of aortic knob
Deviation of trachea to the right
Presence of a pleural cap
Elevation and rightward shift of right mainstem bronchus
Depression of left mainstem bronchus
Obliteration of space between pulmonary artery and aorta
Deviation of oesophagus (or NG tube) to the right
  Helical contrast enhanced CT scanning has close to 100% sensitivity and specificity for aorta rupture, however CT scanning should be reserved for patients that are haemodynamically stable.

Endovascular repair is also now an acceptable alternative approach.",FALSE,"I chose this answer because the X-ray revealed a grossly widened mediastinum, which indicates that trauma has occurred in the chest area. The widened mediastinum would suggest that the trauma has occurred near the point of origin of the left subclavian artery, as this artery is located in the mediastinum.

In an ideal world every trainee radiologist would have all the intricacies of staging for all tumour types committed to memory. A qualified subspecialist radiologist could reasonably be expected to be extremely familiar with the staging for cancers within their remit but for the majority of trainees it is simply not practical to memorise each and every staging scheme. As an overall strategy, the most important stages to understand are those which change the management for patients.
  MRI
On MRI a cervical cancer appears as hyperintense soft tissue on T2 and is isointense on T1. There is early enhancement with post-contrast fat saturated T1 sequences.
  Trachelectomy?
A trachelectomy (fertility preserving surgery) involves the removal of the cervix, upper vagina and parametrium. The uterus is ‘closed’ with a purse string suture which is designed to remain patent to allow the passage of menstrual blood. Any subsequent pregnancy should be delivered by caesarean section. Invasion of the cervical stroma does not necessarily preclude a trachelectomy, neither would central necrosis.
For cervical cancer there has recently been a big change in management strategy between stages IB1 (one B one), and IB2 (one B two). It is sometimes possible to preserve fertility for patients with stage I disease whereas once the disease has progressed to stage II fertility preserving surgery is inadequate. Clearly this can have huge implications for the patient if they have not yet completed their family. As surgical and oncological strategies are refined further it may well be that some patients beyond stage IB1 are offered fertility preserving surgery, with counselling regarding the likelihood of recurrence, at the discretion of the individual surgeon. Fortunately, owing to the success of the national screening programme for cervical cancer, the majority of patients have a low stage when they are diagnosed. Stages I and II are detailed below. Stages III and IV have not been included for the sake of brevity.

  Hysterectomy?
The next abrupt change in management comes at stage IIB and consequently there is much in the literature on the importance of recognising parametrial invasion. The parametrium is fibrous tissue lateral to the cervix which extends superiorly up to the Fallopian tubes and is bounded inferiorly by the pelvic floor muscles – it lies between the layers of the broad ligament. If the cervical stroma (the smooth muscular layer deep to the epithelium, seen as a hypointense rim on T2w MRI) is intact, the negative predictive value for parametrial invasion is around 95%.
  Lymph nodes
The presence of involved lymph nodes is significant because these can be included in the radiotherapy fields. Regional lymph nodes for cervical cancer are pelvic, iliac and para-aortic nodes whereas inguinal lymph nodes would be considered metastatic (ie M1 in the TNM staging).
Most cervical cancer is squamous cell in origin but some can be adenocarcinoma. The literature is slightly variable regarding trachelectomy for adenocarcinoma however most sources agree that neuroendocrine and sarcomatous varieties of cervical cancer have recurrence rates too great for trachelectomy to be a viable consideration. There is a subtype of adenocarcinoma called minimal deviation adenocarcinoma which is associated with Peutz-Jegher syndrome.
  Summary
Cervical cancer is hyperintense on T2 and isointense on T1. The cervical stroma is seen as a black line on T2.
Stage IB2 cancers are not amenable to trachelectomy – this includes tumours larger than 4cm or with extension into the vagina or parametrium
Stage IIB cancers are not amenable to a hysterectomy – this includes invasion into the parametrium
Inguinal lymph nodes are considered metastatic (para-aortic are considered regional)
Most cervical cancer is squamous cell carcinoma
Peutz-Jegher syndrome is associated with minimal deviation adenocarcinoma",TRUE,The correct answer is 5. Squamous cell carcinoma. Squamous cell carcinoma is an aggressive type of cancer that is more likely to spread to other parts of the body and is therefore not suitable for fertility preserving surgery.,2,This question falls under the category of Clinical Judgement.,C,FALSE,,B,TRUE,A
14203,230652,A 14-year-old girl complains of upper back pain and is taken to the GP by her mother. The GP finds a thoracic scoliosis on examination and requests x-rays. The x-rays show a 5mm sclerotic focus in the left pedicle of T8. What is the most likely diagnosis? Select ONE answer only.,SBA: Paediatrics,Osteoid osteoma,Osteoblastoma,Scheuermann disease,Ehler-Danlos syndrome,Neurofibromatosis Type 1,A,84%,9%,5%,1%,2%,"Explanation:
Osteoid osteoma
These are small benign tumours but which can be quite symptomatic, classically with pain relieved by aspirin. The majority form in the diaphyses of long bones but the posterior elements of the spine is another classic location.
The radiolucent nidus and symptoms of night pain in a young patient point to either an osteoid osteoma or an osteoblastoma. The final diagnosis comes down to size. <1.5cm is definitely an osteoid osteoma, and >2 cm is definitely an osteoblastoma. There is a nasty grey area somewhere between the two sizes.
On x-ray the radiolucent nidus may not be fully appreciated and the abnormality which is picked up will be the consequential sclerotic solid periosteal reaction. In the spine there may be a painful scoliosis concave towards the lesion as a result of adjacent muscular spasm. CT is used to confirm the diagnosis as the nidus is readily appreciable.
  Osteoblastoma
Osteoblastomas are quite rare, even for bone tumours. To all intent and purposes they can be considered as large osteoid osteomas. They occur in slightly older patients than osteoid osteomas but most patients are still under 30-years-old. Around a third arise in the posterior elements of the spine, sometimes giving a painful scoliosis, a further third can be found in the long bones and roughly the remaining third arise in the small bones of the hands and feet.

Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia
This predominantly causes bronchiectasis in the middle and lower lobes. Only 50% have Kartagener’s syndrome (A triad of situs inversus, sinusitis and bronchiectasis), hence the normal heart position in the question. Affected men are infertile, and women are subfertile.
  ABPA
This is generally only seen in asthmatics and is characterised by central bronchiectasis particularly in the mid-zones and sometimes upper zones. Centrilobular nodules are also a feature.
  Aspiration
This classically causes lower lobar bronchiectasis, but not in this demographic without mention of risk factors for aspiration in the history.
  Cystic Fibrosis
This is causes bronchiectasis but predominantly affects the upper lobes. Don’t be fooled by the mention of fair hair which is a red-herring in this question.

14104,230652,A 40-year-old lady undergoes a colposcopy for an abnormal smear result. The registrar notices some small yellowish lumps on the surface of the cervix. What is the most likely diagnosis? Select ONE answer only.,"SBA: Genito urinary, Adrenal, Obstetrics & Gynaecology and Breast",Nabothian cyst,Cervical cancer,Skene duct cyst,Gartner duct cyst,Aberrant insertion of the ureter,A,82%,7%,6%,4%,1%,"Explanation:
Anatomy is the key to differentiating between the various female urogenital cysts most of which are, for the most part, asymptomatic incidental findings.
Skene duct cyst
These are retention cysts of the paraurethral ducts and usually they are asymptomatic. On MRI they are seen inferior to the pubic symphysis but lateral to the external urethral meatus. Signal characteristics reflect their cystic nature with high T2 signal but fluid-fluid levels may also be present if there has been intracystic haemorrhage.
Bartholin gland cyst
The bartholin glands secrete lubricating fluid into the inferior third of the vagina. They are found in highest numbers at the posterolateral aspect of the inferior vagina. Although usually asymptomatic, when infected or inflamed a Bartholin gland cyst can present as a painful lump. On MRI they show as high T1 signal owing to the mucoid fluid.
Urethral diverticulum (also known as urethrocele)
Dysuria, dyspareunia and post-void dribbling are classical for this condition. An outpouching of the urethral mucosa protrudes through the smooth muscle. This is seen on MRI as high T2 signal adjacent to or surrounding the urethra. Urinary stasis within the diverticulum predisposes patients to the formation of calculi, which can be seen as low signal on the T2 scan, and adenocarcinoma which will enhance with gadolinium.
Nabothian cyst
Blockage of the mucinous glands on the cervix causes tiny fluid-filled structures to form. These are asymptomatic and appear as small yellow bumps on colposcopy. On MRI they are cystic with high T2 signal and can show high T1 signal owing to their mucein content. They are an incidental finding.
Gartner duct cyst
These are usually found incidentally on MRI scans but can cause dyspareunia. They do not communicate with the urethra and would be unlikely to cause post-void dribbling. They are remnants of the Wolffian ducts and occur superiorly in the anterolateral wall of the vagina. On imaging they appear straightforwardly cystic. For the most part they occur sporadically but they can also be seen in conjunction with renal agenesis or ectopia and are also typical of a rare condition called Herlyn-Werner-Wunderlich syndrome. This condition causes duplication of all or part of the female genital tract with unilateral haematometrocolpos and ipsilateral renal agenesis.
Ectopic ureter
The ureter normally inserts into the trigone of the bladder but ectopic insertions do occur. If these are below the external urethral sphincter the patient may experience dribbling symptoms however these are likely to have been present from birth. An ectopic ureter may be an isolated diagnosis or may form part of a VACTERL presentation and there is an affiliation to renal duplexity. Vesico-ureteric reflux is also very common since the normal valve mechanism is not present to prevent it. Abnormal ureteric anatomy is well demonstrated either with fluoroscopic studies or a highly T2 weighted sequence on an MRI scan.

Sagittal spine - useful to evaluate facet and costovertebral joints
  Ankylosing spondylitis
This disease usually presents in early adulthood with gradual onset of back pain. There is a male preponderance, though it can affect women too. The vast majority (>90%) of patients are HLA-B27 positive. Radiologically the late features are classical with:
Bilateral symmetrical sacroiliitis
Enthesopathy - calcified tendon insertion sites
Bamboo spine - vertebral syndesmophytes, particularly in the thoracolumbar spine
Dagger sign - spinous process fusion
Erosion, then fusion at the symphysis pubis, costochondral, costovertebral and sternoclavicular joints
Thoracic manifestations: upper lobe pulmonary fibrosis, pericarditis, aortic root dilatation
Early features are far more subtle and require a higher index of suspicion
Enthesopathy - high signal on MRI at tendon insertion sites
Romanus lesions - triangular shaped oedema at the corners of vertebral bodies
Andersson lesions - bony oedema in the vertebral bodies adjacent to the disks.
Oedema in the sacroiliac joints.
  Patients with advanced ankylosing spondylitis are at increased risk of pathological fractures due to fusion. These can be pelvic fractures following a simple fall, or chance fractures of the spine (involving all three columns - in ankylosing spondylitis, these fractures are also sometimes termed chalk-stick or carrot fractures).",FALSE,"STIR is not the best sequence for evaluating bone marrow abnormalities in ankylosing spondylitis.

14037,230652,"A 58-year-old gentleman presents with a change in bowel habit and weight loss. He has a history of mild asthma and stable angina. Colonoscopy demonstrates a high rectal mass. CT does not identify the presence of any metastatic disease. Rectal MRI is performed to complete local staging. The tumour is easily identifiable and there is no breach of the muscularis mucosa. A fusiform dilatation of the superior rectal vein is demonstrated with subcentimeter, rounded nodes demonstrating restricted diffusion along the vascular pedicle. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in the management of the patient? Select ONE answer only.",SBA: Gastrointestinal,Neoadjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy,Total pelvic exenteration,MRI liver,Palliative chemotherapy and radiotherapy,AP resection followed by chemotherapy and radiotherapy,A,40%,4%,9%,4%,44%,"Explanation:
The muscularis mucosa is present only in the upper part of the rectum and is located outside of the lamina propria but inside the muscularis propria. Involvement of the muscularis mucosa therefore means the lamina propria too must also be involved. Involvement of the muscularis propria (and therefore by definition the muscularis mucosa and the lamina propria) in rectal tumours (particularly invasion into the perirectal fat of over 5mm) means neoadjuvant chemo and radiotherapy is necessary prior to resection (T3). Often low grade T3 (T3a and T3b) cancers now are treated with primary surgery (particularly in older patients with a shorter overall anticipated follow-up time).
However, if there is evidence of spread along the vessels (classically fusiform dilatation of the superior rectal vein or micronodularity along the vascular pedicle) then neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy is the mainstay of treatment with re-staging after the treatment course.
  Rectal cancer
MRI The muscularis propria is the outer wall of the rectum and shows up as low signal on T2 weighted sequences.
Since the rectum (like the oesophagus) does not have a serosa, once spread beyond the muscularis propria into the mesorectal fat has occurred (ie a T3 tumour), nodal involvement is also feasible. The mesorectal fascia is a thin plane of connective tissue which contains fat, the rectum, local lymph nodes as a distinct anatomical entity and is of paramount importance in rectal cancer management. Spread beyond the mesorectal fascia denotes a T4 tumour. MRI is excellent for local staging of rectal cancer because the mesorectal fascia is seen clearly as a thin black line on T2 weighted sequences and its involvement or lack thereof can be readily discerned. In contrast, the tumour appears as intermediate signal on T2, distorting the normal anatomy.
The fascia is also referred to as the ‘CRM’ which stands for circumferential resection margin and relates to the surgical operation performed for rectal tumours, namely a total mesorectal excision (TME). The proximity of the tumour extent to the CRM is prognostically important; tumours with a >1mm margin before they reach the CRM are far less likely to recur. A <1mm margin is taken as involvement of the CRM.",FALSE,"Answer: 5. AP resection followed by chemotherapy and radiotherapy. The rectal MRI has identified a fusiform dilatation of the superior rectal vein and subcentimeter, rounded nodes demonstrating restricted diffusion along the vascular pedicle. These findings are suggestive of a locally advanced rectal cancer, and the most appropriate next step in the management of the patient would be an AP resection followed by chemotherapy and radiotherapy. This approach is known to be the most effective in treating locally advanced rectal cancer and is the gold standard of care.",2,"3.

14061,230652,You are reporting a CT scan on a 64-year-old man who has had intermittent episodes of rectal bleeding. The main finding is of early opacification of the ileocolic vein. What is the most likely diagnosis? Select ONE answer only.,SBA: Gastrointestinal,Angiodysplasia,Crohn's disease,Ulcerative colitis,Chronic mesenteric ischaemia,Acute mesenteric ischaemia,A,93%,1%,1%,4%,1%,"Explanation:
Angiodysplasia
The colon is rich with blood vessels and, with increasing age, there can be some dilatation and dysplasia of these vessels. This usually occurs on the antimesenteric border and can give rise to both mild intermittent bleeding or larger lower gastrointestinal haemorrhages. Angiodysplasia is the most common vascular lesion of the gastrointestinal tract.
The caecum and ascending colon, supplied by the right colic artery, are most frequently affected but angiodysplasia can occur on the rest of the colon or the small bowel too. On an angiogram, a cluster of arterially enhancing vessels may be seen on the antimesenteric border of the bowel but a more frequent finding is that of early opacification of the draining ileocolic vein. The ileocolic vein is also often found to have become dilated and tortuous, remaining opacified in a late venous phase too.
Around 20% of patients have concurrent aortic stenosis.
    The right colic artery from Gray's Anatomy
    Mesenteric angina
Mesenteric angina is a clinical syndrome caused by episodic sup-optimal perfusion of the small or large bowel. This typically occurs in the post-prandial setting when the oxygen requirements of the stomach increase and it 'steals' the blood supply from the stenotic, compromised supply to the rest of the bowel. The radiological findings are akin to a chronic type of mesenteric ischaemia or ischaemic colitis. Chronic ischaemia leads to stricturing and, unlike malignant strictures, these will be smooth in nature. By contrast, the other features listed can all be found in an acute setting.
  Ischaemic colitis
Anything that compromises the vascular supply to the bowl can cause ischaemic colitis. This can be a thrombus, mechanical strangulation or a prolonged period of hypotension (most commonly encountered in the setting of an ITU patient). Mucosal hyperenhancement can be seen on CT as a consequence of increased permeability in the setting of a shocked bowel (other signs of shock include hyperenhancement of the adrenal glands and a slit like configuration to the inferior vena cava). Mucosal necrosis leads to oedema and haemorrhage with sloughing as the dead layer of cells falls away. Necrosis of the submucosal and muscularis layers leads to stricturing. Thumbprinting is a term derived from the appearances of a non-specifically oedematous bowel on a barium study. The same appearance on CT is less suggestive of the classic thumbprint indentations seen on fluoroscopy but the term is still used. Loss of integrity of the mucosa allows gas to enter the mesenteric vessels and thereby the portal venous system. Gas in the periphery of the liver is suggestive of portal venous gas (as opposed to aerobilia) and is a late sign of ischaemic bowel associated with a poor outcome.
The involvement of different areas of the bowel can give a clue as to the affected vessel. The watershed areas are those at the very fringes of supply from the different mesenteric arteries and are the first to be affected in low flow states.
  Crohn's disease
Crohn's disease is characterised by discontinuous (skip lesions) transmural non-caseating granulomatous inflammation. By contrast, ulcerative colitis is characterised by continuous mucosal inflammation. Crohn's disease is usually diagnosed in adolescence or young adulthood and patients present with non-specific abdominal pains, diarrhoea, weight loss and anaemia. Crohn's disease can affect any part of the entire length of the gastrointestinal tract, in contrast to ulcerative colitis which affects only the colon, but owing to the high concentration of lymphoid tissue in the terminal ileum the vast majority of patients will have terminal ileal involvement, in particular thickening of the iliocaecal valve. Aphthous ulceration is common and on endoscopy a cobblestone appearance to the mucosa can be seen where the thickened and oedematous wall is broken up by deep longitudinal fissures. Deep ‘rosethorn’ ulcers can be seen on fluoroscopic studies. Strictures and fistulae characterise the chronic sequela of this disease.
  Ulcerative colitis
Whereas Crohn's disease causes discontinuous transmural inflammation in ulcerative colitis it is a continuous segment of bowel which is affected beginning at the rectum and progressing proximally. Additionally, it is only the mucosa and submucosa which are affected. Patients present with symptoms of abdominal pain, bloody diarrhoea and experience relapses and periods of remission with the disease. In general, the small bowel is spared with the exception of the terminal ileum which can be affected in a so-called ‘backwash ileitis’ manner. On imaging colonic mucosal hyperenhancement can sometimes be seen, along with mucosal oedema (so-called thumbprinting). On fluoroscopic studies pseudopolyps can be seen – these are actually islands of normal mucosa or granulation tissue surrounded on all sides by inflammation. In the chronic phase the colon may become narrower, smooth and featureless as the haustral markings are lost. This is described as a lead-pipe appearance.",TRUE,"Angiodysplasia is a condition that is characterized by the presence of abnormal, enlarged and fragile blood vessels in the gastrointestinal tract.

10436,230652,An 85-year-old man who has been a lifelong smoker is found to have lymphangitis carcinomatosis on a CT scan. What is the most likely primary?,SBA: Cardiothoracic and vascular,Pancreas,Thyroid,Adrenal,Testicular,Lymphoma,A,48%,25%,2%,6%,19%,"Explanation:
There are four pieces of information given to us in this question on which to base our answer.
The patient is male
The patient is elderly
The patient is a heavy smoker
The patient has lymphangitis carcinomatosis
Of the cancers listed only pancreatic, lymphoma or adrenal cancers have any association with smoking and of these it is pancreatic cancer which stands out as the most closely associated. The patient is certainly in an appropriate demographic for pancreatic cancer. Furthermore, alongside thyroid cancer, pancreatic cancer is the most widely appreciated of those provided to cause lymphangitis carcinomatosis. The final piece of evidence to consider is that in terms of population statistics pancreatic cancer and lymphoma (non-Hodgkin lymphoma) have the highest incidence among those listed.
Lymphangitis carcinomatosis is easy to recognize on a scan but can be described in a number of different ways on paper. It occurs when tumour cells, spread via the lymphatics, accumulate in the connective tissues of the lung, in particular the interlobular septa. The classical description is as a smooth thick reticular polygonal network.
A mnemonic for the likely cancers is: Certain Cancers Spread By Plugging The Lymphatics (this is not an exclusive list). Of these Breast accounts for just over half of cases and gastric cancer accounts for most of the remainder.

11141,230652,A teaching case is being reviewed which shows an epidural mass extending for the length of 3 vertebral bodies in the thoracic spine.

What is the most likely diagnosis?,SBA: Musculoskeletal and Trauma,Astrocytoma,Chordoma,Aneurysmal bone cyst,Synovial cyst,Epidermoid,B,14%,58%,1%,8%,18%,"Explanation:
The term dumbbell is classically used to describe the appearance of neurofibromas, but the question specifically asks for an epidural lesion. The only epidural lesion in the answers provided is a chordoma, hence this is the correct answer. Around 15% of neurofibromas are extradural and a further 15% have both extradural and intradural components.
  Dumbell lesions of the spinal cord are those which extend from the canal to the paravertebral space via the exit foramina and are a classic finding for the following intradural tumours:
Schwannoma
Neurofibroma
Ganglioneuroma
Neuroblastoma
Meningioma
In the case described the lesion is extradural so the description of ‘dumbbell extension’ is a little stretched. Chordomas are aggressive lesions which tend to grow large and are usually very big at the time of diagnosis. Bony erosion and paravertebral spread is common but this is slightly different from the more benign sounding feature of ‘dumbell extension’. Technically though there is indeed spread from the canal to the paravertebral space through the exit foramina. The information provided in the question is irritatingly (but deliberately) sparse though.

14165,230652,A 20-year-old man undergoes an x-ray of his right knee which shows a small effusion despite a normal joint space. He goes on to have an MRI. On the MRI there is nodular thickening of the synovium in the suprapatellar space which returns high signal on both T1 and T2 weighted sequences. What is the most likely diagnosis? Select ONE answer only.,SBA: Musculoskeletal and Trauma,Lipoma arborescens,Haemophilic arthropathy,SAPHO,PVNS,Rheumatoid arthritis,A,71%,11%,2%,15%,1%,"Explanation:
Lipoma arborescens
This condition can affect children or adults and is thought to be a reaction to chronic inflammation of the synovium leading to extensive fatty infiltration of the synovium. It is almost always the knee which is affected. Plain radiographs will show only an effusion, which may be large, but on MRI there is frond-like or nodular synovial proliferation which returns fat-signal according to the different sequences used. The signal should be high on T1 and T2 but suppress on fat-saturated sequences. Post-contrast the synovium itself will enhance. Treatment is by synovectomy.
PVNS - Pigmented villonodular synovitis
The classic joint to be affected by PVNS is the knee but it can also occur at other large joints. Usually only one joint is affected in each patient. On x-ray the only sign may be a large joint effusion. Large subchondral cysts can also be seen. On MRI however, the appearances are characteristic. Haemorrhagic proliferation of the synovium in a frond-like villonodular fashion gives rise to the classic low signal 'feathery' sea-anemone-like finding. On susceptibility weighted sequences there is blooming artefact owing to the presence of haemosiderin. Patients are usually middle-aged and treatment is with synovectomy although there is a high rate of recurrence.
If the patient is male, the usual differential diagnosis for PVNS is of haemophilic arthropathy owing to the presence of blood products there too. PVNS appears as a differential diagnosis for subarticular lucent bone lesions due to the formation of large subchondral cysts.
Rheumatoid arthritis
A joint effusion and synovial thickening (which would avidly enhance post-contrast) is a worthy description for rheumatoid arthritis however the high-fatty signal of the synovium is not a feature of rheumatoid arthritis. As the condition develops, patients with rheumatoid arthritis exhibit erosive changes with cartilage loss, bony erosions and marrow oedema.
SAPHO (Synovitis, acne, palmoplantar pustulosis, hyperostosis, osteitis)
This disease is thought to be a variant of psoriatic arthropathy. The cutaneous manifestations may not be apparent at diagnosis (like psoriatic arthropathy) but hyperostosis and osteolysis and ankylosis of the sternocleidomastoid joint is absolutely typical. On a nuclear medicine bone scan, bilateral uptake in the sternoclavicular joints and manubrium is called a ‘bull’s head’ sign. About a third of patients also have spinal disease with paravertebral ossifications and osteosclerosis. Unilateral sacroiliitis may also occur. Appearances can be quite striking on CT. In the knees, ankles and small joints of the hands there may be inflammation of the joints with juxta-articular osteoporosis.
Haemophilic arthropathy
The larger joints are most at risk for this disease, and the knee is particularly classical. On an xray there may only be a joint effusion in early disease but erosions and subchondral cysts develop. In particular there may be widening of the intercondylar notch (for which there is a differential diagnosis of: JIA/RA, Psoriatic arthropathy, TB and haemophilia) due to pannus formation. Also classical is epiphyseal overgrowth secondary to hyperaemia.
On an MRI there may well be nodular deposits on the synovium however the presence of blood degradation products renders these very low in signal on all sequences with blooming artefact present on gradient echo sequences or similar. If a haemarthrosis is present, the signal of the fluid will change depending on the chronicity of the event.
A haemophilic pseudotumour occurs in around 1-2% of patients with haemophilia. The presence of blood degradation products leads to a wide variety of intralesional signal patterns. The lesions are usually surrounded by a low signal haemosiderin rim though. Lesions can arise within bone (intra-osseous) or in soft tissues (usually muscular). Growth and pressure effects on adjacent bone can cause scalloping.",FALSE,"SAPHO (synovitis, acne, pustulosis, hyperostosis, and osteitis) is a rare disorder characterized by a combination of bone and joint inflammation, skin lesions, and bony overgrowth. The MRI findings of nodular thickening of the synovium in the suprapatellar space with high signal on both T1 and T2 weighted sequences are consistent with a diagnosis of SAPHO.",2,,C,TRUE,,A,FALSE,E

Which of the following procedural techniques is LEAST beneficial to facilitate drainage?,SBA: Gastrointestinal,Transplenic percutaneous drainage,Pleural transgression,Adjust CT gantry angle,Endoscopic transgastric drainage,Adjust patient positioning,A,55%,22%,15%,5%,3%,"Explanation:
The Transplenic route of drainage is least likely to be the preferred route due to the risk of non–self-limiting haemorrhage leading to hypotensive shock.
All interventions in the upper abdomen involve the risk of pleural complications. In most cases, pleural transgression cannot be avoided during subphrenic abscess drainage. Therefore, it is essential to monitor the patient closely for pneumothorax following the procedure.
CT gantry tilt and adjusting patient positioning may significantly improve the accessibility to the target area.
In cases of subphrenic abscess Endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS), intervention techniques can also be considered to perform puncture and drainage via the transmural route where percutaneous treatment has been difficult. The stomach is most commonly traversed for percutaneous drainage of pancreatic collections and is the preferred route for transmural drainage.",FALSE,"Adjusting the CT gantry angle would be the least beneficial technique to facilitate drainage because it would not provide direct access to the abscess.

14389,230652,You are reviewing the chest radiograph of a baby boy born recently. He has developed hypoxia and required admission to the neonatal unit. Which of the following diagnoses is correctly associated with the likely findings on x-ray? Select ONE answer only.,SBA: Paediatrics,"Transient tachypnoea of the newborn - prominent hila markings, effusions","Hyaline membrane disease - granular, hyperinflated lungs","Meconium aspiration - coarse lung markings, hypoinflation",Neonatal pneumonia - deep sulcus sign,Pneumothorax - regional air space opacification,A,73%,15%,8%,2%,1%,"Explanation:
Neonatal Respiratory Distress © Medical Exam Prep
    Of the five main respiratory conditions of the neonate the differential diagnosis can be narrowed based on gestational age. The presence of hyperinflation can also be useful but may not always be present where feasible so should not be used as an absolute discriminator. If present, it is useful.
  Meconium aspiration
Meconium is sticky and causes a chemical pneumonitis in the lungs, seen as patchy consolidation. In addition, small globules of meconium entering bronchi and bronchioles of a decreasing calibre act as a ball-valve mechanism and lead to air trapping; thus the lung volumes of a baby with meconium aspiration may be increased. Air bronchograms are notably absent. The typical baby in a meconium aspiration situation is post-term.
  Transient tachypnoea of the newborn (TTN)
The classical patient for TTN would be a term baby born by caesarean section to a diabetic mother. During normal vaginal delivery the compression of the baby as it descends the birth canal acts to squeeze fluid out from its lungs. This mechanism is all but absent during a caesarean section. Consequently, these babies are born with an excess of retained fluid. The CXR of an affected baby will show bilateral symmetrical air space opacification with air bronchograms, fluid in the fissures and pleural effusions. This peaks in severity at 24hrs but resolves by three days.
  Hyaline Membrane Disease (HMD) also known as surfactant deficient disease (SDD)
It is to reduce the likelihood of this disease developing that a woman in pre-term labour will be offered a steroid injection. The steroids help the neonatal lungs to develop faster and increase the likelihood of their being able to produce surfactant once delivered. Where there is surfactant deficiency the alveoli collapse. The CXR will show a granular opacification throughout both lungs which progresses to bilateral ground glass opacification with air bronchograms. If exogenous surfactant is given to the baby there may be asymmetrical improvement in the appearances depending on how much reaches each lung. Of note HMD does not cause pleural effusions. Finally a normal CXR at 6hrs post delivery excludes HMD.
  Neonatal pneumothorax
Usually chest radiographs are performed with the baby lying down. The free gas in the pneumothorax rises to the superior part of the baby and therefore the classical apical contour seen in adult pneumothoraces, is lost. Instead unilateral hyperlucency may be seen and any pleural line should be regarded with extreme suspicion.

Her only past medical history is of recurrent epistaxis. What is the most likely diagnosis?",SBA: Cardiothoracic and vascular,Rendu-Osler-Weber syndrome,Breast cancer metastases,Endocarditis,Guillain-Barre syndrome,Wegener granulomatosis,A,65%,2%,1%,1%,31%,"Explanation:
In the real world there are many other explanations which could explain this scenario however of the five provided the answer must be something which connects the presence of a lung mass to an acute infarction. Usually the lungs are an excellent filter for micro-emboli however in the presence of a pulmonary AVM (seen as a mass on CXR) these can enter the systemic circulation leading to a CVA. Discounting the epistaxis, breast cancer metastasis would not be an unreasonable differential diagnosis, with the left sided weakness consequent on a cerebral metastasis; certainly breast cancer itself is far more common than Rendu-Osler-Weber syndrome.
  Rendu-Osler-Weber syndrome (also known as hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia)
There are three separate vascular manifestations of this syndrome; telangiectasias, AVMs and aneurysms. The condition is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion and the vast majority of patients will have a positive family history. Hepatic and pulmonary AVMs are a known association and of patients with a pulmonary AVM or AVMs, the prevalence of Rendu-Osler-Weber syndrome is also reasonably high. Pulmonary AVMs have their own spectrum of complications including:
Paradoxical emboli – TIAs and CVAs
Septic emboli – cerebral abscess
Hypoxia due to shunting
High output cardiac failure
In an exam question setting patients are often described as having epistaxis due to nasal telangiectasia, indeed most patients do suffer from frequent episodes. Cutaneous telangiectasias are also common, particularly affecting the lips as well as the oral mucosa and usually by the age of 40. Older patients in their 50s or 60s may experience GI bleeding secondary to angiodysplasia.",TRUE,"Rendu-Osler-Weber syndrome is a genetic disorder characterized by recurrent epistaxis (nosebleeds) and the presence of telangiectasias (abnormal dilations of the small blood vessels).

Geode
This is a subchondral cyst associated with osteoarthritis which should have communication with the joint space and be present in an older patient.
  Pseudo-cyst of calcaneus
This is a variation of the normal trabecular pattern centrally within the calcaneus. Will not have a crisp edge for this reason. Persistence of thin trabeculae and a visible nutrient foramen are supporting features.
  Unicameral bone cyst
This is a well-defined lesion with thick sclerotic edges and potentially a multiloculated appearance. Absence of calcification within the lesion is a key differentiator from intraosseous lipoma, although if fractured, a fallen fragment sign can be seen.
  Intraosseus lipoma
Calcification within the center of this lesion is a key feature which differentiates it from other lesions of plain film. Fat density on CT or MRI would also be a key differentiator.
  Chondroblastoma
The calcaneus, like the patella, is an epiphyseal equivalent, so any epiphyseal lesions should be considered a possibility in this bone. They usually arise eccentrically in the epiphysis, are lobuated with a thin sclerotic margin.",FALSE,"Unicameral bone cyst is a common diagnosis for a well-defined, central, triangular radiolucent area seen on the lateral projection in the talar dome.

Select ONE answer only.,"SBA: Genito urinary, Adrenal, Obstetrics & Gynaecology and Breast",The risk to the foetus is small,When the baby is born it should have a thyroid function test during the first week of life,The patient should receive dialysis as soon as feasible,Gadolinium does not cross the placenta,The gadolinium administered during the scan is teratogenic to the foetus and termination should be considered,A,71%,13%,2%,6%,10%,"Explanation:
Gadolinium in pregnancy
Gadolinium also crosses the placenta and is excreted by the foetus into the amniotic fluid. The chelated form of gadolinium in itself poses no risk to the foetus however the free form of gadolinium is teratogenic and the longer the foetus is exposed to the chelated gadolinium administered for the scan, the greater the risk of each molecule of gadolinium becoming dissociated from its chelate. For this reason therefore, gadolinium should only be administered in a patient known to be pregnant, if there is likely to be significant diagnostic benefit from the resultant images.
Gadolinium is undetectable in maternal blood 24 hours following administration.
  Imaging pregnant patients in suspected PE
A pregnant patient suspected to have a pulmonary embolus should undergo a chest x-ray to look for alternative causes of shortness of breath such as a lower respiratory tract infection, pleural effusions or a pneumothorax. In the event that they go on to have a VQ scan a chest radiograph is required for comparison.
Thereafter the patient should undergo bilateral lower limb venous dopplers if they have signs or symptoms of deep vein thrombosis. Around a third of pregnant patients who develop pulmonary emboli will have a deep vein thrombosis and for these patients treatment can be started on the basis of their DVT diagnosis without the need for further imaging. If the patient has no signs or symptoms of a DVT, they should proceed to a VQ scan or a CTPA.
The patient should be counselled that there is a small increase in the absolute risk of the foetus developing a childhood cancer following a maternal VQ scan but also that the absolute risk of maternal breast cancer is reduced compared to a CTPA.
  CTPA
CTPA imaging confers a lower dose to the foetus than V/Q scanning, although this effect is diminished in the third trimester as the gravid uterus becomes closer to the field of view.
Unfortunately however, CTPA confers a far greater dose to the breast tissue of the mothers at a time when the tissue is more radiosensitive than it would otherwise be in a non-pregnant woman.
A secondary consideration is the use of iodinated contrast. Iodine crosses the placenta and is excreted by the foetal kidneys into the amniotic fluid. Babies of mothers who have received iodinated contrast during pregnancy should be tested during their first week of life for thyroid suppression although there is little evidence in literature to suggest that many if any infants have developed hypothyroidism following maternal intravenous iodine exposure.
Technical factors to performing a CTPA scan in pregnant patients, if required, are also important to consider. Hyperdynamic circulation can render usual triggering bolus mechanisms suboptimal and raise the possibility of a non-diagnostic study.
  V/Q or Q only scanning
V/Q scanning confers a far lower breast dose to the mother but the dose to the foetus, particularly when small, can be greater owing to tracer accumulation within the solid organs of the mother. The mother should be encouraged to adequately hydrate and void frequently in the subsequent hours/days following a scan.
Many institutes choose to perform perfusion scanning only in pregnant women on the understanding that if the perfusion scan is normal then there is no need to go on to perform the ventilation study. The perfusion scan can also be performed at half the usual dose to further reduce the foetal-dose. Naturally doing so comes with the trade-off of lower sensitivity and specificity.
  Considerations during lactation
Less than 1% of injected iodine or gadolinium is excreted into breast milk and less than 1% of this is then absorbed by the baby's intestinal tract. Although these amounts are considered acceptably low as to not necessitate any breast-feeding cessation advice many families are understandably over-cautious. It is accepted that contrast agents are undetectable in blood 24hours after administration and so any mother wishing to 'pump-and-dump' despite the negligible risks need not do so for longer than a day. Care should, however, be given to counsel the family that it is possible for inadvertent weaning to occur even after short intervals and this should be factored in to any decision made by the family.
Following a nuclear medicine study the risks to the baby are two-fold; firstly from tracer excretion into the breast milk, but also through proximity to the mother during breast-feeding. Recommendations for breast-feeding interruption vary depending on the half-life of the tracer used. For perfusion imaging using technetium (half-life 6 hours) breast milk should be expressed for the first 24 hours following the scan. In theory, it need not be discarded but can safely be bottle-fed to the baby after these 24 hours have elapsed, however in practice many patients none-the-less choose to discard it.
Most tracers simply require adherence to a washout time but of note, the precautions following administration of Gallium-67 based tracers (most commonly used for pyrexia of unknown origin) are much more limiting and, practically speaking, unfortunately lead to complete cessation of breastfeeding. The half-life of Ga-67 is approximately 78 hours. Breastfeeding should, if time allows, be stopped for 2-4 weeks prior to the scan to allow the breast tissue to become less radiosensitive while the tracer circulates within the mother. Where this is an unacceptably long delay for the clinical state of the patient the study can be performed straight away anyway but in either case, milk should also be discarded for at least a further two weeks following the study. Clearly a disruption to breast-feeding of such a long time is far from ideal, even assuming that a patient who is sufficiently unwell as to need a PUO study is able to continue breast-feeding at all, and is likely to lead to complete cessation of breast-feeding. There are other ways to image PUO using Tc99m labelled white blood cells which can be considered.",FALSE,Gadolinium does not cross the placenta because it is too large of a molecule to pass through the placental barrier. This means that the gadolinium administered during the scan is not likely to reach the foetus and therefore is not likely to cause any teratogenic effects.,1,3.

The urinary bladder is a hollow muscular organ situated at the base of the pelvis. In a normal adult it can accommodate between 300 and 600 mls of urine. A central nervous system response resulting in the perception of fullness and the need to void is usually triggered once the bladder volume reaches around 400 mls.
It is enveloped in extraperitoneal fat and connective tissue and is separated from the pubic symphysis by an anterior prevesical space called the space of Retzius.
The empty bladder is roughly pyramid shaped and has four surfaces:
A superior surface
Two inferolateral surfaces
A posterior surface
  The bladder can be divided into four areas:
The apex – which is located superiorly and points towards the superior edge of the pubic symphysis
The body – the large central portion located between the apex and the fundus
The fundus (base) – which is triangular in shape and located posteroinferiorly
The neck – which is the point where the fundus and inferolateral surfaces converge
  Urine enters the bladder via the ureters, which pierce its lateral aspect of the bladder in an oblique fashion. This creates a valve that prevents the backflow of urine. Urine exits via the urethra, which connects to the urinary meatus.
The trigone of the bladder is a smooth triangular region situated within the fundus of the bladder that is formed by the two ureteral orifices and the urethra.

Select ONE answer only.,"SBA: Genito urinary, Adrenal, Obstetrics & Gynaecology and Breast",PI-RADS2,PI-RADS1,RECIST,PRECISE,PERCIST,A,72%,14%,3%,9%,3%,"Explanation:
PI-RADS (Prostate imaging reporting and data system)
This scoring system (now on its second version) has been introduced to streamline prostate cancer reporting and improve inter-operator variability. The scoring system differs slightly between the transitional zone and the peripheral zone but overall, using a combination of the T2, DWI/ADC and dynamic contrast enhancement lesions are graded 1-5 depending on the likelihood of malignancy.
PRECISE (PC Radiological Estimation of Change in Sequential Evaluation)
The PRECISE guidelines have been proposed as a scoring system for evaluating the follow-up scans when patients are on 'active surveillance' management for their prostate cancer (Moore, et al. Eur Urol. 2017;71(4):648-655).
  1 - Resolution of previous features suspicious on MRI
2 - Reduction in volume and/or conspicuity of previous features suspicious on MRI
3 - Stable MRI appearance: no new focal/diffuse lesions
4 - Significant increase in size and/or conspicuity of features suspicious for prostate cancer
5 - Definitive radiologic stage progression
  PERCIST (Positron emission response criteria in solid tumours)
This is a scoring system used for PET/CT imaging to follow up lesions and determine progression. Below is a simplified summary of the different possible outcomes.
Complete metabolic response (CMR) - resolution of target lesions with no new lesions developing
Partial metabolic response (PMR) - 30% reduction in SUV (corrected for lean body mass) in the target lesions
Stable metabolic disease (SMD) - neither CMR, PMR nor PMD
Progressive metabolic disease (PMD) - >30% increase in SUV (corrected for lean body mass) or new lesions
  RECIST (Response evaluation criteria in solid tumours)
To better develop inter-operator agreement in cancer follow-up imaging the RECIST criteria were developed.
Target lesions are identified on the index staging scan and these lesions are evaluated on subsequent scans against size standards to determine whether there has been overall response to treatment or disease progression. Below is a simplified version of the different possible outcomes.
Disease response
Complete - disappearance of all target lesions
Partial - >30% decrease in the sum of the longest axes of all of the target lesions
Stable disease - grey area between partial response and disease progression
Disease progression - >20% increase in the sum of the longest axes of all of the target lesions",TRUE,"I chose 4 because the PI-RADS2 scoring system is the most commonly used system for evaluating prostate cancer lesions on MRI scans.

This system is more accurate than other scoring systems, such as RECIST and PRECISE, which are used to evaluate other types of cancer.",1,"3.

14463,231994,The interlobar arteries divide to form which arteries? Select ONE answer only.,"SBA: Genito urinary, Adrenal, Obstetrics & Gynaecology and Breast",Arcuate arteries,Segmental branches,Peritubular network,Interlobular arteries,The vasa recta,A,66%,16%,1%,14%,2%,"Explanation:
The arterial supply to the kidneys is from the renal arteries, two fast flowing arteries that arise from the abdominal aorta at the L2 vertebral level. As the abdominal aorta is situated slightly to the left of the midline the right renal artery is longer than the left. The kidneys receive approximately 20% of the cardiac output.
After arising from the aorta, the right renal artery passes behind the inferior vena cava, the right renal vein, the head of the pancreas, and the second part of the duodenum as it travels to the kidney. The left renal artery passes behind the left renal vein, the body of the pancreas and the splenic vein as it travels to the kidney. The left renal artery is crossed anteriorly by the inferior mesenteric vein.
The renal arteries then enter the kidney at thehila of the kidneys, which lie approximately in the transpyloric plane at the L1 vertebral level. At the hila the renal arteries divide into four or five segmental branches.
Each segmental branch divides to form the interlobar arteries that are situated on either side of every renal pyramid. These interlobar arteries then undergo further division to form the arcuate arteries.
The interlobular arteries are then given off at right angles from the side of the arcuate arteries, and head into the cortical substance. Once within the cortex a final division takes place with the interlobular arteries dividing to form the efferent arterioles.
In the outer two-thirds of the cortex, the efferent arterioles form the peritubular network. The inner third of the cortex is supplied by long, straight arteries known as the vasa recta.

He is thought to have suffered a stroke and undergoes carotid Doppler study. This shows reversal of flow in his left vertebral artery with biphasic flow in his left axillary and brachial arteries. The right is normal. What is the diagnosis?,SBA: Central Nervous and Head & Neck,Subclavian steal syndrome,Takayasu aortitis,History of Blalock-Taussig surgery,Thoracic aortic dissection,Coarctation repair complication,A,94%,0%,1%,4%,1%,"Explanation:
The key to this question is ‘reversal of flow in the vertebral artery’. Subclavian steal syndrome occurs when blood supplying the arm (usually the left arm) travels via the ipsilateral vertebral artery in order to bypass a proximal obstruction of the subclavian artery. The distal subclavian artery ‘steals’ blood from the vertebral artery circulation. This gives rise to two different categories of symptoms:
Arm -  weaker pulses, numbness, paraesthesia, fingertip necrosis
Brain - syncope, ischaemic symptoms
The most likely cause of subclavian steal would be atherosclerosis. Takayasu aortitis can indeed cause subclavian steal but would not be at the top of a differential list without further prompts from the history. Likewise thoracic aortic dissection can also cause steal and would be a reasonable guess but subclavian steal as an answer is more accurate.
Blalock-Taussig surgery is performed in the management of Tetralogy of Fallot and is included as a differential here simply because the subclavian artery is (or used to be, prior to the advent of synthetic grafting) ligated during the procedure.
Similarly complications following repair of an aortic coarctation can also lead to subclavian steal.",FALSE,"Coarctation repair complication is the most likely diagnosis in this case, as the symptoms and findings (reversal of flow in the left vertebral artery with biphasic flow in the left axillary and brachial arteries) are consistent with a coarctation repair complication. Coarctation repair is a procedure used to treat a narrowing of the aorta, which can cause blood flow to be restricted or reversed in certain arteries. The reversal of flow in the left vertebral artery, along with the biphasic flow in the left axillary and brachial arteries, indicate that the patient has likely experienced a complication from a previous coarctation repair.",2,,A,TRUE,,A,FALSE,D

The available answers in this question are deliberately limited. In some centres CT perfusion is used to detect reversible acute ischaemia but this answer is not given. Unenhanced CT is the first test a patient suspected to have an acute infarction should undergo but this is largely to rule out haemorrhage should the patient be a candidate for thrombolysis therapy. The question, however, actually asks which test should be performed to detect the infarction and hence the answer is DWI. DWI is far superior to an unenhanced CT in confirming the presence of an acute infarction (except in the brainstem and medulla where there is a high false negative rate within the first 24hours). A DAT scan is a nuclear medicine test used in the differential diagnosis of Parkinsonism.",FALSE,"CT with visipaque is the best test to demonstrate a right MCA infarction acutely because it is a form of computed tomography (CT) imaging that uses a contrast agent, such as Visipaque, to enhance the visibility of the blood vessels and other structures in the brain.

Congenital heart disease (ASD or coarctation)
  Sprengel shoulder
This condition can occur in isolation as well as part of Klippel-Feil syndrome. It is (like Klippel-Feil syndrome) also often associated with renal anomalies. Sprengel shoulder is a congenital abnormality where the scapula (usually, but not exclusively, unilateral) is attached to the cervical vertebra either by a fibrous or osseous connection, and therefore fails to descend into the normal position. The result is elevation and medial rotation of the scapula, which is usually hypoplastic. The condition can be readily appreciated on a plain film although cross-sectional imaging is useful to plan surgical correction if required. If present, the osseous connection between the scapula and the spine is termed an omovertebral bar.",FALSE,"I chose this answer because Klippel-Feil syndrome is a condition characterized by the fusion of two or more vertebrae in the neck, which can cause a short neck, low hairline, restricted neck movement, and scoliosis.

9981,231994,A 34-year-old man is suspected to have a traumatic cauda equina following a road traffic accident. He also undergoes an x-ray of his hand. There is generalised osteoporosis and a fracture to the scaphoid but the radiologist also notices hook like osteophytes on the radial aspect of the metacarpal heads. The MRI of his spine is normal but the liver returns very low signal on all sequences. What is the most likely diagnosis?,SBA: Musculoskeletal and Trauma,Haemochromatosis,Wilson disease,Calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease,Enteropathic arthropathy,Alkaptonuria,A,91%,4%,2%,1%,2%,"Explanation:
Haemochromatosis
The primary version of this disease can be inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion. Excess dietary iron is absorbed and this accumulates in all tissues of the body leading to various different problems.
Secondary haemochromatosis can arise if patients receive numerous blood transfusions without sufficient chelation to mitigate against the iron overload.
Cirrhosis – the presence of the excess iron in the liver leads to unusual signal properties on an MRI scan. Iron is paramagnetic and causes spin dephasing. T2* and T2 sequences are particularly vulnerable to this effect but lower than expected signal will be seen on all sequences. Importantly the signal from the spleen and bone marrow should be normal. By contrast they will be involved in cases of transfusional siderosis.
Generalised osteoporosis
Hook like osteophytes on the radial aspect of the metacarpal heads – these are highly characteristic
Chondrocalcinosis, particularly affecting the knees
Insulin dependent diabetes
Congestive cardiomyopathy
Skin pigmentation
  Calcium pyrophosphate dehydrate disease (CPPD) also known as pseudogout
CPPD can present in an acute or subacute fashion but is also seen as a chronic cause of joint inflammation. It may be misdiagnosed as simple osteoarthritis owing to its often bilateral and symmetrical distribution but there are also a couple of areas of the body which can be affected in particular, and which would be unusual for isolated degenerative changes.
The patellofemoral joint – joint space loss here can be extremely striking with almost complete preservation of the joint space at the medial and lateral compartments of the knee
Triangular fibrocartilaginous complex of the wrist – calcification
Radiocarpal joints – degenerative changes without involvement of the DIPs and PIPs
  Wilson disease
Inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion, this disease results from an excess of copper within the body due to the inability of the liver to excrete it. It can present in childhood with cirrhosis but later presentations are more likely to be due to the neuropsychiatric manifestations. Clinically adolescent or adult patients develop tremor and dysarthria due to copper deposition in the lentiform nucleus. The classic diagnostic feature is Kayser-Fleischer pigment rings in the eyes. Radiologically the following features can be seen:
Hepatic manifestations: The liver appears normal on MRI since fatty infiltration effectively cancels out the paramagnetic effects of copper
Musculoskeletal manifestations: Generalised osteoporosis, subarticular cysts, chondrocalcinosis and arthropathy which can mimic CPPD
CNS manifestations: White matter atrophy and T2 hyperintensities predominantly affecting the basal ganglia and thalami. T1 signal is also high in these areas, differentiating it from many of the other basal ganglia disorders. There is a classical feature of ‘sparing of the red nucleus’ leading to an appearance known as the giant panda sign at the level of the pons.
Enteropathic arthropathy
Sacroiliitis and spondylitis are the hallmarks of enteropathic arthropathy. It is an important seronegative spondyloarthropathy. Outside of the axial skeleton, other features common to all seronegative spondyloarthropathies are also found. These include arthritis in the hands and feet, uveitis, and enthesitis (especially calcaneal). Interestingly although it is most commonly discussed in relation to Crohn’s disease and Ulcerative Colitis, only 5 and 10% respectively of patients with these conditions will develop enteropathic arthropathy. By contrast of patients with Whipple disease, around 75-90% of them will suffer from enteropathic arthropathy. Infection with Salmonella, Shigella and Yersinia are also known associations.
  Alkaptonuria also known as ochronosis
This condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. It is caused by excessive circulating levels of homogentisic acid (HGA) when the enzyme which would usually degrade it is deficient. HGA has an affinity for collagen and accumulates in the connective tissues throughout the body. In visible light HGA has a blackish colour and thus the disease can be diagnosed in infancy when a baby’s nappies are stained black by the presence of HGA in the urine. By the time patients reach their 20s pigmentation may be visible in their skin, particularly the ears. This is initially a dark yellow colour (hence the term ochronosis, from ‘Ochre’ in Greek meaning a dark yellow colour) but can progress to blue-grey and black.
In imaging chondrocalcinosis is the most prominent feature, with calcification and destruction of the intervertebral discs. Premature osteoarthritic changes to the hands, feet, shoulders, hips and knees will also develop as the collagen deteriorates. Deposition in the heart and kidneys too leads to cardiac and renal failure.",TRUE,"I chose 4 because haemochromatosis is the most likely diagnosis. Haemochromatosis is a condition in which there is an excessive accumulation of iron in the body, which can lead to osteoporosis, fractures, and osteophytes.

10656,231994,A 55-year-old man is admitted with abdominal and back pain. He thinks he has lost weight over the last few months. His blood results show his ESR to be raised. There is a tender pulsatile mass in his abdomen. He undergoes a CT scan. Which shows the infrarenal aorta to be 6cm in diameter with a rind of homogeneous soft tissue density surrounding it. The radiologist also notes moderate hydronephrosis and proximal hydroureters bilaterally. What is the most likely diagnosis?,SBA: Cardiothoracic and vascular,Inflammatory aortic aneurysm,Mycotic aneurysm,Syphilitic aneurysm,Degenerative aneurysm,Leaking aneurysm,A,73%,17%,4%,1%,5%,"Explanation:
An aortic aneurysm is simply a dilatation of the aorta. The vast majority of these will be degenerate, caused by longstanding atherosclerosis and hypertension. Connective tissue diseases such as Marfan syndrome or Ehlers-Danlos can predispose to aortic aneurysms at an earlier age. Fusiform aneurysmal dilatation is typical of a degenerate aneurysm.
An inflammatory aneurysm occurs when there is inflammation and fibrosis affecting the wall of the aorta. Fibrotic stricturing of the ureters with consequential hydronephrosis is classical and serves as an excellent differentiator from mycotic or degenerative aneurysms. They also occur in a slightly younger age bracket to degenerative aneurysms. Inflammatory aneurysms are associated with retroperitoneal fibrosis and thereby other IgG4-related diseases.
A mycotic aneurysm occurs when the integrity of the wall of the aorta is compromised by bacterial infection, usually spread from a source elsewhere within the body either haematogenously or by local spread. These aneurysms tend to be more saccular or multilobulated in morphology, reflecting the focal mural compromise. Adjacent soft tissue stranding is present and adjacent gas locules are almost pathognomonic albeit rare. This would be the second most likely diagnosis in this scenario.
A syphilitic aneurysm (also termed Luetic aneurysms), represents tertiary syphilis and therefore has a lag time of anywhere from 5 to 25 years from the initial infection. It occurs when the vasa vasorum supplying the wall of the aorta itself with blood becomes infected with the spirochete Treponema pallidum which causes syphilis. Although there has been a resurgence of syphilis in recent years it should be noted that many of the new cases are likely to be caught and treated long before tertiary syphilis develops.
IgG4 related diseases are one of Radiology’s newest entities. They comprise a constellation of fibrotic conditions affecting virtually every part of the body, mediated by a subclass of Immunoglobulin called IgG4. Where one condition exists others may also be present. The more common of these include:
Orbital pseudotumour
Fibrosing mediastinitis
Reidel thyroiditis
Autoimmune pancreatitis
Sclerosing mesenteritis
Retroperitoneal fibrosis
An elevated ESR and/or CRP is often seen.",FALSE,"I chose this answer because the CT scan results indicate that the patient has a pulsatile mass in the abdomen, which is a characteristic of a degenerative aneurysm. Additionally, the radiologist noted moderate hydronephrosis and proximal hydroureters bilaterally, which are common symptoms associated with degenerative aneurysms. Finally, the ESR being raised could suggest an inflammatory process, which is also associated with degenerative aneurysms.",2,,A,TRUE,,A,TRUE,D

11101,231994,A 65-year-old man complains of worsening leg numbness. On examination he is found to have an absent patella reflex. He is suspected to have a foraminal lumbar disc protrusion. At which level would this be?,SBA: Musculoskeletal and Trauma,L1/2,L2/3,L3/4,T4/5,L5/S1,C,3%,13%,72%,7%,5%,"Explanation:
This is a straightforward anatomy question. In the cervical spine the nerve roots exit above their named vertebral body; thus at the level of C4/5 it is the C5 which will be exiting. This is unlike the lumbar spine where the nerve root exits below its named vertebral body and is explained by the presence of 8 cervical nerve roots with only 7 cervical vertebra.
There is also the concept of the exiting nerve root and the descending nerve root. This applies in particular to disc bulges/protrusions/extrusions and is more pertinent in the lumbar spine. The exiting nerve root at a given level will be one less than the descending nerve root. (ie at L2/3 the exiting nerve will be L2 and the descending nerve will be L3). Central disc pathology affects the descending nerve whereas paramedian or foraminal disc pathology may affect the exiting nerve.

11766,231994,"On the ward round of the neonatal intensive care unit, a baby is reviewed. She was born a week ago at 33+4 weeks gestation. She has been receiving mechanical ventilation but her oxygen saturations have deteriorated during the last 24 hours.  A chest x-ray shows slight overinflation with black streaks radiating from the hilum. What is the most likely diagnosis?",SBA: Paediatrics,Pulmonary interstitial emphysema,Transient tachypnoea of the newborn,Meconium aspiration,Hyaline membrane disease,Bronchopulmonary dysplasia,A,81%,2%,2%,5%,10%,"Explanation:
Of the five main respiratory conditions of the neonate the differential diagnosis can be narrowed based on gestational age.  The presence of hyperinflation can also be useful but may not always be present where feasible so should not be used as an absolute discriminator. If present, it is useful.
    Meconium aspiration
Meconium is sticky and causes a chemical pneumonitis in the lungs, seen as patchy consolidation. In addition small globules of meconium entering bronchi and bronchioles of a decreasing calibre act as a ball-valve mechanism and lead to air trapping; thus the lung volumes of a baby with meconium aspiration may be increased. Air bronchograms are notably absent. The typical baby in a meconium aspiration situation is post-term.
  Transient tachypnoea of the newborn (TTN)
The classical patient for TTN would be a term baby born by caesarean section to a diabetic mother. During normal vaginal delivery the compression of the baby as it descends the birth canal acts to squeeze fluid out from its lungs. This mechanism is all but absent during a caesarean section.  Consequently these babies are born with an excess of retained fluid. The CXR of an affected baby will show bilateral symmetrical air space opacification with air bronchograms, fluid in the fissures and pleural effusions. This peaks in severity at 24hrs but resolves by three days.
  Hyaline Membrane Disease (HMD) also known as surfactant deficient disease (SDD)
It is to reduce the likelihood of this disease developing that a woman in pre-term labour will be offered a steroid injection. The steroids help the neonatal lungs to develop faster and increase the likelihood of their being able to produce surfactant once delivered. Where there is surfactant deficiency the alveoli collapse. The CXR will show a granular opacification throughout both lungs which progresses to bilateral ground glass opacification with air bronchograms. If exogenous surfactant is given to the baby there may be asymmetrical improvement in the appearances depending on how much reaches each lung. Of note HMD does not cause pleural effusions. Finally a normal CXR at 6hrs post delivery excludes HMD.
  Pulmonary interstitial emphysema (PIE)
As the name would suggest, this disease is diagnosed when there is air within the interstitial tissues of the lungs. It is caused by alveolar rupture due to the barotrauma of mechanical ventilation or positive airway pressure.  It can be associated with hyaline membrane disease and is prevalent in infants of a low birth weight. Complications such as pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum can be severe and acutely life threatening. Radiographically there is hyperinflation and lucencies in either a cystic pattern or streaks emanating from the hila and following the direction of the bronchi/bronchioles. It is treated with high frequency oscillation ventilation which is less traumatic to the lungs.
  Bronchopulmonary dysplasia
This also occurs due to barotrauma in ventilated neonates but is a more gradual process, occurring later on in the baby’s life; perhaps after a couple of weeks. Typically (but not exclusively) the baby is premature (hence requiring ventilation). It only usually occurs after the baby in question has received ventilation of >21% oxygen for longer than 28 days. The lungs are hyperinflated and what starts off as ground glass opacification becomes complete opacification with air bronchograms in a few days. After 30 days it can be seen as coarse linear lucencies, described as radiating from the hila, with focal emphysematous change. Mikity syndrome has similar features but occurs in term infants who have not received mechanical assistance.",TRUE,"I chose Pulmonary interstitial emphysema as the most likely diagnosis because the chest x-ray showed slight overinflation with black streaks radiating from the hilum, which are consistent with the signs of pulmonary interstitial emphysema. The baby was born prematurely and has been receiving mechanical ventilation, which can increase the risk of developing pulmonary interstitial emphysema. Additionally, the baby's oxygen saturations have deteriorated over the last 24 hours, which is another sign of pulmonary interstitial emphysema.",2,"This question falls under category 2: A question about clinical judgement, what is the correct diagnosis?",C,TRUE,,A,TRUE,A

Gaucher disease
This lysosomal storage disease is usually inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion and is around 100 times more common in Ashkenazi Jews than it is in the rest of the population. There is accumulation of glycolipid in macrophage lysosomes. The infantile form is universally lethal before 24 months of age but the adult form may be asymptomatic at diagnosis and is typically diagnosed in young adulthood if not earlier. Hepatosplenomegaly is common and co-existent with thrombocytopaenia and anaemia secondary to bone marrow failure. Osteonecrosis occurs in the femoral or humeral heads leaving serpiginous sclerotic areas or a bone-within-bone appearance. Modelling deformities such as the Erlenmeyer flask deformity (Flared metaphysis + diaphyseal thinning) also occur and are considered characteristic.

  Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI)
A defect on either chromosome 7 or 17 leads to abnormal type 1 collagen. Most cases are inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion. An adult with OI is most likely to have either type I or type IV. On imaging there is diffuse undermineralisation of the skeleton and (sometimes extreme) cortical thinning. Once a child with OP has become mobile the soft bones become bowed under the weight of the body. The pressure of the femoral heads on the soft acetabulae leads to acetabular protrusion. Basilar invagination results from pressure of the cervical spine on the base of the skull. Insufficiency fracture of the vertebral bodies lead to a biconcave appearance. OI is a differential diagnosis for multiple wormian bones which persist to adulthood.

Select ONE answer only.,SBA: Musculoskeletal and Trauma,Spontaneous pneumothorax,Hyperthyroidism,Fibrous dysplasia,Hyperpigmented patches on her back,Polyostotic lesions,A,66%,23%,6%,3%,2%,"Explanation:
This tends to be a condition of childhood-adolescence. It is otherwise rarely seen in patients older than 30. It is a benign condition caused by abnormal osteoblasts and leading to focal replacement of normal bone with fibrous tissue. Most cases are monostotic but polyostotic cases occur around 20% of the time. Virtually any bone can be affected although the long bones tend to be more frequently affected in the polyostotic form. That said, fibrous dysplasia is also a typical differential diagnosis for a rib or skull lesion.
Classically the appearances on x-ray or CT is described as 'ground glass' in matrix, and situated within the centre of the bone (i.e. medullary), but often causing bony expansion. Since the bone is abnormal there is an increased risk of fractures but unless there is an acute injury there should not be a periosteal reaction.
On a nuclear medicine bone scan the lesions tend to show increased uptake and this is therefore rarely useful in diagnosing this condition.
Aside from pathological fractures, the condition can also occasionally be complicated by secondary degeneration which would be to osteosarcoma and should be suspected if the patient complains of pain and the growth of a soft tissue mass. This occurs more frequently in patients who have previously been exposed to radiation.
There are a number of eponymous or descriptive terms associated with fibrous dysplasia:
Shepherds crook deformity - coxa varus deformity of the proximal femur. This is usually used to describe the effect of fibrous dysplasia on the proximal femur with chronic bowing and remodelling secondary to microfractures, but the same appearance can occur with conditions such as Paget disease or osteogenesis imperfecta, for the same reasons.
Protrusio acetabuli - fibrous dysplasia is one of a number of things which can cause protrusion of the femoral head into the pelvis due to remodelling of the acetabulum.
Leontiasis ossea - facial involvement causing a specific appearance said to resemble that of a lion. Owing to canal stenosis caused by bony expansion patients can exhibit cranial nerve palsies.
Cherubism - facial (maxilla and mandible) involvement causes a specific appearance said to resemble that of a cherub. Owing to canal stenosis caused by bony expansion patients can exhibit cranial nerve palsies. Cherubism is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion.
McCune-Albright syndrome - this almost always only affects girls and consists of a triad of cafe-au-lait spots, precocious puberty (or other endocrine pathology), and polyostotic fibrous dysplasia. The cafe-au-lait pigmentation is often on the back and can commonly be seen to respect the midline.
Mazabraud syndrome - this is a very rare condition. Patients present with polyostotic fibrous dysplasia and soft tissue tumours and are at increased risk of malignant degeneration to osteosarcoma.
  Hand-Schüller-Christian Disease – classically a triad of destructive bony lesions, diabetes insipidus and exophthalmos is a type of histiocytosis.

What is the diagnosis?",SBA: Central Nervous and Head & Neck,Toxic encephalopathy,Cerebral toxoplasmosis,Lymphoma,Neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation,Behcets disease,A,71%,9%,2%,15%,3%,"Explanation:
This question draws on the classic differential diagnosis of ‘basal ganglia signal changes’.
  Poisoning
Impairment of mitochondrial function in the highly metabolically active basal ganglia classically causes high T2/FLAIR signal in a bilateral symmetrical fashion but the T1 is usually low in signal. Methanol, cyanide, and carbon monoxide can all cause this. Hopefully the history would be more helpful in establishing the diagnosis than that which has been provided here.
  Neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation aka hallervorden-Spatz syndrome
The classic radiological feature which comes up here is the ‘eye of the tiger’ sign where there is low T2 signal in the globus pallidus due to iron accumulation. Confusingly the patient can go on to develop high T2 signal in these areas as gliosis develops. The typical patient will be a young woman with a family history of movement disorders presenting with rigidity or bradykinesia.
  Behcet syndrome
Behcet syndrome is classically described as a triad of oral and genital ulcers associated with one of several ocular manifestations. Its effect on the CNS tends to be as meningoencephalitis or venous sinus thrombosis. In the basal ganglia, in some patients, it can cause lesions with low T1 signal and high T2 signal.
  Toxoplasmosis
Infections derived from intrauterine transmission cause periventricular calcifications affecting the basal ganglia. Otherwise, in AIDS related toxoplasmosis the findings are more of multiple ring enhancing lesions.
Toxoplasmosis is a more common finding in AIDS patients than lymphoma is, by a large margin. On MRI it is seen as multiple ring enhancing lesions, which can show haemorrhage particularly following treatment. One of the stronger differentiators between toxoplasmosis and lymphoma is the SPECT findings. This is sometimes termed ‘hypometabolic’ meaning the lesions do not demonstrate SPECT uptake. The table below gives some general features of the two conditions. There is however considerable overlap in the imaging features despite these broad trends.

Separating HIV encephalitis from PML can challenging in real life. HIV encephalitis causes bilateral symmetrical white matter changes, seen as high T2 signal (The T1 sequences can be normal). There is also sparing of the subcortical U-fibres.
  Cryptococcus
This is an opportunistic yeast-like fungus which therefore requires a degree of immunocompromise, typically AIDS. The cryptococcomas are non-enhancing low density lesions in the basal ganglia. These show as high signal on T2 sequences. A granulomatous meningitis can also occur. They can be differentiated from VR spaces on FLAIR where VR spaces will suppress (being CSF in content) whereas the mucoid cryptococcomas will not.
  Toxoplasmosis
Toxoplasmosis is a more common finding in AIDS patients than lymphoma is, by a large margin. On MRI it is seen as multiple ring enhancing lesions, which can show haemorrhage particularly following treatment. One of the stronger differentiators between toxoplasmosis and lymphoma is the SPECT findings. This is sometimes termed ‘hypometabolic’ meaning the lesions do not demonstrate SPECT uptake. The table below gives some general features of the two conditions. There is however considerable overlap in the imaging features despite these broad trends.

Her parents report that she has also passed two bloodstained stools during this time. On examination there is a soft mass in the right upper quadrant. She undergoes an ultrasound scan which shows a pseudokidney appearance. What is the most likely diagnosis?",SBA: Paediatrics,Meckel diverticulum,Intestinal polyposis,Coeliac,Lymphoma,Henoch-Shonlein purpura,A,69%,7%,1%,2%,21%,"Explanation:
The patient has insussusception. In children the most common cause of this is idiopathic (thought to be lymphoid hyperplasia in Peyer patches), however this has not been listed as an option. The most common lead point in children of this age is a Meckel diverticulum.
  Meckel diverticulum
The rule of 2s is not absolute but does give a guide to some of the pertinent numerical features of this condition. Persistence of the vitelline duct located on the anti-mesenteric border of the ileum can result in a true diverticulum. Around half of these contain ectopic gastric mucosa secreting acid which causes mucosal ulceration and bleeding.
  99mTc-pertechnetate studies are very sensitive and specific for diverticulae which contain gastric mucosa. The patient should be fasted for at least 4 hours and should not have undergone any barium studies in the preceding 4 days. 20 minutes following tracer injection images are taken which, if positive, show a focus of uptake in the right lower quadrant appearing at the same time as gastric activity does. Cimetidine, which is an H2 blocker, can be given an hour prior to the tracer to improve the quality of the study if necessary.
On mesenteric angiography if a vitelline artery is present (an anomalous end branch artery from the superior mesenteric artery) this is said to be pathognomic of the condition.

  Intussusception
The peristaltic action of the bowel can pick up and invaginate itself and this is known as intussusceptions. It can happen in adults but the majority of patients are children. The usual cause is thought to be patches of lymphoid hyperplasia (Peyer patches) which act as a lead point but for other lead points there is a strong correlation with the age of the child. The table lists some of the prominent causes. There are many others for the children older than 3.
On ultrasound the intussusceptions has a ‘pseudokidney’ appearance when viewed longitudinally and a bulls-eye appearance when viewed in transverse section. Both appearances come about because there are alternating layers of hyperechoic mesenteric fat and hypoechoic bowel wall. When there is anechoic fluid between they layers the intussusceptions is unlikely to be reducible via the pneumatic technique.
On a barium enema the appearances are either of a meniscus or a coiled spring.
The donor loop is termed the intussusceptum and the receiving loop (recipient) is termed the intussuscipiens.

The symptoms of Meckel diverticulum include abdominal pain, vomiting, and bloody stools, which are all present in this case.

14251,231994,Which SINGLE statement regarding the greater curvature of the stomach is true?,SBA: Gastrointestinal,It is convex in shape,It is shorter than the lesser curvature,The angular notch is situated half way along it,The lesser omentum arises from it,It forms the medial border of the stomach,A,87%,0%,5%,6%,2%,"Explanation:
The stomach is a J-shaped digestive organ that lies in the superior aspect of the abdomen between the oesphagus and the duodenum.
It has four main regions:
The cardia – which is around the opening of the oesophagus
The fundus – which is the dilated superior portion lying beneath the left dome of the diaphragm
The body – which is the large central position lying between the fundus and the pylorus
The pylorus – which is the lower portion that facilitates the emptying of its contents into the duodenum
  The medial and lateral borders of the stomach are curved, forming the greater and lesser curvatures of the stomach:
The greater curvature – forms the longer, convex, lateral border of the stomach. The greater omentum arises from it.
The lesser curvature – forms the shorter, concave, medial border of the stomach. The lesser omentum arises from it.
  There is a sharp indentation two-thirds of the way along the lesser curvature called the angular notch. This point marks the junction of the body and the pylorus.
Food boluses enter the stomach via the lower oesophageal sphincter. Once within the stomach protein digesting enzymes, such as pepsin, are released. Hydrochloric acid within the stomach provides a suitably acidic pH for these enzymes to work and also serves to kills bacteria. The food boluses are churned up by peristaltic contractions of the wall and converted into chyme. The passage of chyme into the duodenum is controlled by the pyloric sphincter, which lies between the pylorus and the duodenum.
   ",TRUE,"I chose this answer because it is the only statement that is true regarding the greater curvature of the stomach. The greater curvature of the stomach is convex in shape, and it forms the medial border of the stomach.

10491,231994,A 55-year-old man has a repeat CXR showing a persistent patch of consolidation 4 months after his last xray. The patch is peripheral in location. On a CT scan there is a linear lucency running through an area of ground glass shadowing. He goes on to have a PET CT scan which does not show avidity. What is the most likely diagnosis?,SBA: Cardiothoracic and vascular,Bronchoalveolar carcinoma,CMV pneumonia,Eosinophilic pneumonia,Non-specific interstitial pneumonia,Cryptogenic organising pneumonia,A,61%,2%,6%,7%,23%,"Explanation:
Adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS) and minimally invasive adenocarcinoma (MIA)
The term bronchalveolar carcinoma (BAC) is historic and shouldn't really be being used. Early on they appear as tiny areas of ground glass opacification (GGO). This then becomes more defined as a small nodule, sometimes still surrounded by a rim of GGO and termed the ‘fried egg’ sign. Air bronchograms can be seen within a small patch of consolidation, such as in this case. Unlike most other types of lung malignancy, PET/CT is often negative for such cases. Also unlike many other types of lung malignancy the incidence of AIS and MIA is higher in non-smokers. It also affects women more commonly than men (despite the demographics given in this question).
  CMV pneumonia 
Infection with CMV is common among AIDS patients but not all cases are diagnosed prior to the autopsy prevalence of over 50%; it does not cause significant morbidity or mortality. When it does manifest radiologically the findings are relatively non-specific with bronchiectasis, nodules and hazy infiltrates seen in a bilateral symmetrical distribution. It is often diagnosed concurrently with Kaposi sarcoma. As a cause of the tree-in-bud appearance it is unusual because the luminal opacification is derived from bronchial wall thickening as opposed to an exogenous substance. Changes are usually widespread; there is no particular predilection for the middle lobe. There can be significant overlap between the appearances of CMV pneumonia and PCP. The main differences to look for would be an apical predominance for PCP (especially in those taking prophylactic pentamidine), and the presence of cysts in PCP.
  Cryptogenic organizing pneumonia (COP) also known as Bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP)
COP is seen in patients post-infection, post-transplant, with a drug toxicity (chemo or methotrexate among others) or in an idiopathic setting. Patients experience a flu-like illness and a dry cough with worsening dyspnoea dating back over the preceding few months. Patients are often treated initially as a bacterial pneumonia and unsurprisingly there is then no response to antibiotic therapy. On CT there is patchy consolidation or ground glass opacification (GGO) and a third of patients will have pleural effusions or lymph node enlargement.
The reverse halo appearance is synonymous with COP (also known as BOOP – Bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia). It is seen as central ground glass opacification surrounded by a ring of consolidation. There are other conditions which can cause this appearance, of which the prominent ones are:
Wegeners granulomatosis
Sarcoidosis
Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia
  Non-specific interstitial pneumonitis (NSIP)
This is sometimes seen as a collection of left-over conditions which do not fit into under the banners of COP or UIP but is a specific entity in its own right. It can occur in association with the collagen vasculitides (Scleroderma, Sjogren syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis and the like). Non-specific symptoms such as shortness of breath with a dry cough gradually worsen over a period of a few months and on HRCT there will be bilateral symmetrical ground glass opacification with microcystic honeycombing. Radiological changes are seen in a more peripheral distribution and the term ‘subpleural sparing’ is often used since the area immediately adjacent to the pleura can be relatively disease free. The architectural distortion is said to be less with NSIP than with IPF (Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis) and the patients tend to be slightly younger. NSIP usually responds well to steroid therapy.
  Eosinophilic pneumonitis
This term includes a number of related conditions.
Simple pulmonary eosinophilia – also known as Loeffler syndrome – The key to the radiological findings in this syndrome is nodules with a ground glass opacification (GGO) halo. These nodules are said to be transient or migratory with resolution in some areas but new development in others as seen on serial scans. Like most other entities which include eosinophilia, patients commonly have an atopic background such as asthma or eczema.
Acute eosinophilic pneumonia – The eosinophils are found in bronchoalveolar lavage as opposed to the blood in this condition. The patients tend to be relatively young adults who present with a short history of a few days of fever and myalgia. HRCT shows patchy GGO in a bilateral distribution. Patients respond well to steroid therapy
Chronic eosinophilic pneumonia – The significance of the HRCT findings of this condition (in the context of an exam question) is that it gives a ‘reversed bat-wing appearance’ (Differential diagnosis: Desquamative interstitial pneumonia, sarcoidosis, resolving pulmonary oedema). Eosinophils are found both in the bronchoalveolar lavage as well as in the blood. Although patients often have an atopic history already, a diagnosis of adult-onset asthma is commonly seen. HRCT findings include bilateral non-segmental consolidation in the peripheries (hence reverse batwing). There is usually a rapid resolution with corticosteroids.
Idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome – this can be diagnosed where there is an absence of any known cause of eosinophilia with evidence of organ dysfunction such as restrictive cardiomyopathy or interstitial pulmonary opacities.",FALSE,Cryptogenic organising pneumonia (COP) is a type of pneumonia that is characterized by a patch of consolidation on a chest X-ray that persists for more than 4 months.

12741,231994,You are reporting a CT abdomen and pelvis of a 68-year-old gentleman which shows a small exophytic mass arising from the lower pole of the right kidney.  You suspect this to be a renal cell carcinoma. There is no renal vein invasion or sign of local spread but you have noticed a mass in the left adrenal gland. It is 3.5cm in diameter and measures -15 Hounsfield Units on the unenhanced images and shows moderate enhancement on the portal venous phase. What should you suggest?,"SBA: Genito urinary, Adrenal, Obstetrics & Gynaecology and Breast",MRI adrenal glands,Nothing,Ultrasound scan,MIBG,Adrenal biopsy,A,26%,66%,2%,5%,2%,"Explanation:
Despite the fact that this lesion has such low Hounsfield Units it demonstrates moderate enhancement and the patient has an existing malignancy.
  Known malignancy
No known malignancy
0-3cm
>80% benign
4-6cm
>70% malignant
>3cm
>80% malignant
>6cm
>80% malignant
  The best test to diagnose this lesion would be a dedicated adrenal CT scan (unenhanced, portal venous and 15 minute delayed phases). This would enable the radiologist to calculate the absolute and relative washout figures for the mass. The theory is that malignant lesions have greater permeability and therefore retain contrast for longer, giving lower washout values. By contrast benign adrenal adenomas will wash out faster, giving higher washout values.
Of the answers given an MRI scan of the adrenals would be best. An adrenal biopsy is invasive should only be sought if the combination of MRI and CT adrenal scans cannot fathom the answer. An MIBG scan is useful to look for an extra-adrenal pheochromocytoma.
  Adrenal adenoma
These present a diagnostic challenge if only to rule out a malignant adrenal mass. Once the diagnosis is confirmed they can then be left alone and do not require any further imaging. The majority are obvious on CT and obviously adenomas. Owing to their high fat content most adenomas show low Hounsfield units (HU) and HU <18 on an unenhanced study has a sensitivity of 85% and a specificity approaching 100%.
In cases where the fat content is insufficient to make the diagnosis an adrenal protocol CT can be performed. This compares the HU on an unenhanced scan, a portal venous phase scan and a 15 minute delayed phase scan. From these values the absolute washout can be calculated by comparing the difference between the two contrast studies with the amount of contrast taken up in the first place (i.e. the difference between the portal venous phase and the unenhanced phase). The relative washout is calculated by comparing the difference between the two contrast studies to just the portal venous phase (i.e. it is relative to the portal venous phase).
An alternative diagnostic strategy which, but for demand management, is better for patients as far as dose preservation is concerned, is an MRI scan. The fat content of adrenal adenomas shows up well as signal loss on out-of-phase imaging and gives a chemical shift artefact in the frequency encoding direction on both gradient echo and spin echo sequences.  On gradient echo sequences due to the chemical shift a black line appears in all directions and is termed the India Ink effect or etching artefact.
  Diagnostic of adrenal adenoma
At least 60% absolute washout
At least 40% relative washout
<18 HU (99% specific)
<37 HU on a delayed scan
India ink effect on GE MRI
Chemical shift on GE and SE MRI
  Adrenal metastasis
This is an important differential diagnosis for a malignant lesion of the adrenal gland. Lung cancer is the most obvious culprit but other cancers do also metastasize to the adrenal glands (Breast, Colorectal, Renal cell, Malignant melanoma, Pancreas). Metastases take on a variety of appearances depending on their cell type but usually retain contrast for longer than adenomas leading to low washout figures. Owing to their neoplastic nature they are however, usually reasonably vascular and therefore show strong enhancement in the portal venous phase (>100HU). On an MRI scan they enhance with gadolinium but importantly fail to show any signal loss on fat suppression sequences.",FALSE,MIBG is a nuclear imaging technique that is used to diagnose and stage adrenal tumors. It is the most accurate imaging technique for the evaluation of adrenal masses and can detect tumors as small as 1 cm in size.

Select ONE answer only.","SBA: Genito urinary, Adrenal, Obstetrics & Gynaecology and Breast",PIRADS 5,PIRADS 4,PIRADS 3,PIRADS 2,PIRADS 1,B,28%,63%,6%,2%,1%,"Explanation:
The assessment of peripheral zone and central zone lesions is very different in PIRADS assessment.
Peripheral zone
The highest grade of suspicion for malignancy in the peripheral zone is indicated by the presence of marked restricted diffusion (focal high b-value and corresponding low ADC signal), with a PIRADS 5 lesion being one that is greater than 1.5 cm. PIRADS 3 lesions will show some restricted diffusion but this is far less (subjective analysis) than for PIRADS 4 lesions. Dynamic contrast enhancement is used for assessment of peripheral zone lesions only - differentiating between lesions which show only limited restricted diffusion. If there is dynamic contrast enhancement with a type 3 washout curve, the lesion becomes a PIRADS 4 lesion despite the only limited restriction in diffusion.
Transitional zone
The highest grade of suspicion for transitional zone lesions is reserved for moderate T2 lesion which is lenticular or non-circumscribed and moderately T2 hypointense (PIRADS 5 >1.5 cm).
Three plane T2 imaging is common practice and enables full assessment of the peripheral zone of the prostate, particularly examining for extra-capsular extension, bladder base or seminal vesical invasion. T2 is also the most important sequence for lesions in the transitional zone.
Diffusion weighted imaging is essential for PIRADS calculation and is the first sequence that should be used to evaluate lesions in the peripheral zone. Axial dynamic contrast enhanced imaging (after non-contrast axial T1) is then essential to differentiate between between PIRADS 3 and 4 lesions. The three types of curve are known as type 1-2 curves. Type 3 curves are considered most suspicious for prostate cancer. Just like for breast cancer contrast enhancement curves, in a metabolically active lesion there is usually rapid uptake and rapid washout of contrast, leading to the classical type 3 curve. Type 1 and 2 curves in prostate imaging can also occur in malignant lesions but type 3 curves are the most concerning.
  PIRADS curves © Medical Exam Prep
  The T1 weighted sequences are also useful to check for the presence of any haemorrhagic foci although since most patients now undergo their MRI scan prior to any biopsies being taken this has become far less important.
Interestingly the ADC map is more sensitive for carcinoma of the prostate (in the peripheral zone) than the DWI sequences. A finding of focal low signal on the ADC map may be seen in the absence of a corresponding high DWI focus. In the transitional zone however, the T2 sequences are more sensitive.",FALSE,The PIRADS score for this scenario is 5 because the tumor is 12mm in size and has a type 3 curve on the dynamic contrast enhancement analysis.

Inflammation of the pericardium is termed pericarditis and leads to fibrous thickening. Most commonly this occurs either post-operatively in patients undergoing cardiac surgery or as an idiopathic entity although historically it was tuberculosis which was the most common cause of pericarditis. The diagnosis is predominantly clinical with symptoms such as malaise or dyspnoea and signs such as neck vein distension or paradoxical movement of the JVP. On cross sectional imaging thickening of the pericardium to greater than 2mm can be seen and the fibrosis causes a restriction in distensibility. The right ventricle, being more compliant than the left, becomes flattened and furthermore there can be curvature of the septum towards the left. Elsewhere, if the field of view permits, accessory signs such as pleural effusions and even ascites may be seen.
  Pulmonary Emboli
There is some cross-over of the signs and symptoms of pericarditis and a large lobar embolus. On CT, if the embolus is large enough to cause right ventricular strain the septum can sometimes appear bowed with reflux of IV contrast into the hepatic veins.",FALSE,"Tricuspid regurgitation is the most likely diagnosis based on the findings of straightening of the interventricular septum on cardiac MRI. Tricuspid regurgitation occurs when the tricuspid valve does not close properly, allowing blood to flow backward through the valve and into the right atrium.

What is the most likely diagnosis?,SBA: Gastrointestinal,Focal nodular hyperplasia,Hypervascular metastasis,Hepatocellular carcinoma,Hepatic abscess,Focal fatty infiltration,A,74%,15%,4%,3%,3%,"Explanation:
Gadoxetic acid disodium (Primovist) and gadobentate disodium (MultiHance) are hepatobiliary specific MRI contrast agents. They are taken up by hepatocytes and excreted into the biliary system.
  Focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH)
These lesions typically occur in women in late middle age. They are not caused by oral contraceptive use however they do enlarge in response to hormone stimulation. They are composed of hyperplastic hepatocytes and are thought to arise when a small underlying congenital vascular malformation means that an area of the liver receives a better blood supply and therefore grows better, thus they lack a true capsule but can outgrow their blood supply resulting in the classical central fibrous scar which is present in around half of cases. On imaging they do demonstrate mass effect, displacing adjacent vessels, have marked arterial enhancement which fits in with their supposed aetiology. The central scar enhances only on delayed sequences. On MRI they tend to return high signal on T2 weighted sequences. Their appearance on contrast-enhanced ultrasound is interesting; the central scar enhances very early in the arterial phase, branching out in a spoke-wheel type of appearance. During the main arterial phase the lesions enhance strongly before becoming isoechoic in the portal venous phase. On the delayed hepatobiliary phases the lesions are shown to have retained contrast while the adjacent normal liver parenchyma will gradually wash out.  They are the 'only' hepatic lesions to do this (haemangiomas are composed of large vascular channels and usually match the enhancement of hepatic blood vessels. Sometimes the persistent centripetal enhancement arising due to very slow migration of blood through the lesion, is still ongoing during the hepatobiliary phase. This is something of a pseudofinding however, since the filling-in behaviour of th lesion in the previous phases should clearly identify if as a haemangioma, delayed enhancement or otherwise).
Some types of haemangiomata can show enhancement on the delayed phase too but consider that contrast enhanced ultrasound is a dynamic test. For a haemangioma to show enhancement as late as a hepatobiliary phase it will first have enhanced peripherally and then gradually filled in. This contrast behaviour is very different from the central spoke-wheel scar enhancement and subsequent fill-in of an FNH. 
  Time Phase FNH appearance
Arterial phase Around 30s High
Portal venous phase Around 75s Iso
Delayed hepatobiliary phase 20 minutes Higher than the rest of the liver
  Haemangioma
Cavernous hepatic haemangiomas are the most common solid benign liver lesions and the second most common liver lesion overall (after secondary tumours). Pathologically they are composed of large vascular channels in which the blood flows very slowly. They are usually supplied by the hepatic artery which goes some way to explaining their enhancement characteristics. With all contrast studies three different types of enhancement can be seen.
Flash haemangiomas – these show immediate and uniform enhancement which persists on delayed sequences (unlike hypervascular tumours which wash out)
Peripheral nodular enhancement on arterial imaging with complete filling in on delayed images
Peripheral nodular enhancement with incomplete filling in – this usually occurs in giant (>5cm diameter) haemangiomas where the central portion is thrombosed.
  On ultrasound they are usually well-defined hyperechoic compared to normal liver parenchyma. Contrast enhanced ultrasound is coming to the forefront of diagnosis for solitary hepatic lesions, relieving some of the burden of MRI. Haemangiomas show either flash filling or peripheral nodular increased reflectivity followed by a gradual total or near total filling in when microbubble contrast is given.
On MRI the slow flowing blood causes very high signal on T2 weighted images, higher than the spleen and high enough to cause T2 shine through on diffusion weighted images. Conversely although metastases will also show high T2 signal they do not usually outshine the spleen in this regard. Similarly to contrast enhanced ultrasound findings for a haemangioma, the pattern of gradual filling in is replicated with gadolinium-based contrast agents on an MRI scan although on the delayed phase of a hepatobiliary specific contrast agent the lesion will be low in signal as haemangiomas do not contain normal hepatocytes.
Nuclear medicine studies can be useful in the diagnosis of heamangiomata. Sulphur colloid studies will show a photopenic area initially which 1-2hours later shows increased uptake.
  Focal steatosis also known as focal fatty infiltration
The liver plays a small role in fat storage and subtle variation in blood supply and drainage between different areas can lead to variations in the amount of fat in those areas. Focal fatty change is very common and has a geographic appearance on all imaging modalities, with a lack of mass effect (ie preservation of the vascular architecture). It can occur anywhere within the liver but is classically found adjacent to the falciform ligament (i.e. segments II, III and IV). Fat-identifying sequences on MRI can be very useful to cinch the diagnosis with signal drop out on out-of-phase images. Focal fatty sparing on the other hand appears as the inverse of this and on CT will be seen as isoattenuation on a background of a diffusely hypoattenuating liver. On ultrasound the liver will be diffusely hyperechoic when compared to the right kidney, and the spared area will be hypoechoic.
  Hepatic abscess
Liver abscesses can occur in children, for much the same reasons as they arise in adults, although they are far more common in adults. In neonates they may arise as a complication from a misplaced umbilical venous catheter. Pyogenic abscesses result from bacteria accessing the liver via the biliary tree, septicaemia, direct spread, trauma or during a liver procedure. Adult patients are usually in their 60s. Amoebic abscesses occur in slightly younger patients (40s) and tend to result from spread of amoebae from the colon via the portal venous system. On ultrasound abscesses appear as a hypoechoic mass with posterior acoustic enhancement. Internal debris may be apparent. On CT they are usually low in attenuation and may have a rim of enhancing tissue depending on the phase of the contrast. MRI signal characteristics are dependent on the protein content of the pus but usually abscesses return little T1 signal and, owing to their fluid nature, return high signal on T2 weighted sequences. It is said that amoebic abscesses are usually found to be contiguous with the liver capsule.
  Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)
Although metastases are the most common cause of malignant hepatic lesions, hepatocellular carcinoma is the most common primary hepatic malignancy. It usually arises on a background of cirrhosis of any cause. Patients with any of the hepatitis viruses, alcoholic cirrhosis, haemochromatosis, and Wilson disease are all at risk. Carcinogens such as thorotrast and aflatoxin also predispose to HCC formation. Serum alpha fetoprotein levels are often raised, in contrast with cholangiocarcinomas which are one of the main differential diagnoses.
  On imaging HCCs can have a variety of appearances. A large irregular mass with satellite nodules is the most common finding but a diffuse infiltrative version can also occur. Since HCCs derive their blood supply from the hepatic artery they show arterial enhancement on CT with washout on later phases. On ultrasound HCCs tend to be hyperechoic when compared to the rest of the liver and on MRI they show variable signal intensity on both T1 and T2 but arterial enhancement with venous washout can again be seen once Gadolinium has been given. Usually they return slightly higher signal on T2 than the remainder of the liver.
  Fibrolamellar carcinoma of the liver is a specific subtype which occurs in slightly younger patients with otherwise normal livers. It is an echogenic lobulated mass on ultrasound with a central fibrous scar which does not enhance on CT. The lack of enhancement, and sometimes presence of calcification, within the scar separates it from fibrous nodular hyperplasia which is the main differential diagnosis.  On MRI the scar returns low signal on T1 and T2 owing to its fibrous nature.
  Thorotrast is a carcinogenic historic contrast agent used in the 30s and 40s. Its use was abruptly curtailed once it was realised that it is retained indefinitely in the reticuloendothelial system. It causes hepatocellular carcinomas and cholangiocarcinomas but hepatic angiosarcomas are the most frequently quoted related malignancies.
 ",FALSE,"I chose 2. Hepatocellular carcinoma as the most likely diagnosis because it is the most common primary malignancy of the liver and is often associated with hypervascularity. The MRI scan with Primovist showed that the lesion remained hyperintense in the delayed phase compared to the normal liver parenchyma, which is a typical finding for hepatocellular carcinoma.",2,,C,TRUE,,A,,
14598,231994,A 34-year-old man undergoes a left pneumonectomy for lung cancer. He recovers well post-operatively and is reviewed in clinic six months later. He has been reasonably well but has developed increasing breathlessness more recently. A CXR shows mediastinal shift to the left and a near complete white out of the left hemithorax. What is the most likely explanation? Select ONE answer only.,SBA: Cardiothoracic and vascular,Mediastinal rotation,Bronchopulmonary fistula,Under-compensation,Pleural effusion,Empyema,A,30%,17%,27%,24%,2%,"Explanation:
The patient has developed post-pneumonectomy syndrome. The contralateral lung has hyperexpanded, pushing the mediastinum to the ipsilateral side to surgery and leading to respiratory compromise.
Overall post-pneumonectomy changes are features of volume loss with fluid accumulation in the affected hemithorax. A pleural effusion is therefore an expected finding in post-pneumonectomy patients. A unilateral effusion in patients who haven't had a lung resected would be expected to cause contralateral (not ipsilateral as in the vignette) mediastinal shift, if anything.
As the now empty hemithorax gradually fills with fluid an air-fluid level is to be expected. This should reach approximately half-way up the chest on a CXR by day 4 or day 5 and should reach at least 66%, if not 100%, of the height of the chest on a CXR after a fortnight. Ipsilateral mediastinal shift also usually takes place owing to the volume loss although this is not an absolute finding; Some patients will have no mediastinal shift. Diaphragmatic elevation would be an expected finding, diaphragmatic flattening would not.
Post-operative complications of a pneumonectomy include:
5-10% bronchopulmonary fistula
Contralateral tracheal shift
Reduction in height of the fluid level on sequential films
5% ARDS
5% Pulmonary oedema
<5% empyema
Post-pneumonectomy syndrome
This occurs when hyperexpansion of the remaining lung displaces the heart, with rotation of the heart in an anticlockwise fashion along its long axis.
This develops in the first year and usually affects young adults or children. Patients develop exertional dyspnoea or recurrent infections",TRUE,"Mediastinal rotation is the most likely explanation for the patient's symptoms and imaging findings. The pneumonectomy would have resulted in a loss of support for the mediastinum, which would cause it to shift to the left and rotate, resulting in the near complete white out of the left hemithorax seen on the CXR. The rotation of the mediastinum can lead to compression of the pulmonary vessels and airways, resulting in breathlessness.",2,,D,FALSE,,D,,

9176,231994,A 50-year-old man presents to his GP with weight loss and malaise. His GP refers him urgently to the gastroenterology team at his local hospital since the patient is known to them having had a total colectomy aged 20. He undergoes a CT scan which shows significant dilatation of the pancreatic and common bile ducts. What is the unifying diagnosis?,SBA: Gastrointestinal,Familial Adenomatous Polyposis,Peutz-Jegher syndrome,Turcot syndrome,Cowden syndrome,Gardner syndrome,A,67%,12%,4%,6%,12%,"Explanation:
Polyposis syndromes – intussusception is a significant risk
  Familial Adenomatous Polyposis (FAP)
The polyps in FAP are said to resemble a carpet since they are so numerous. There are invariably colonic adenomatous polyps and around half of patients have stomach hamartomas too and a quarter of patients have duodenal adenomas. Patients usually undergo a prophylactic total colectomy and thereafter the greatest risk is of a periampullary carcinoma.
  Gardner syndrome
This is a subtype of Familial Adenomatous Polyposis (FAP) and is a triad of colonic polyps, osteomas of the membranous skeleton (skull, maxilla, mandible) and soft tissue tumours such as desmoid tumours of the mesentery, lipomas, fibromas, keloid scarring. Many patients have supernummary teeth and dental caries requiring significant dental work at an early age.
  Cowden syndrome
This is a rare hamartomatous syndrome which is inherited as an autosomal dominant defect on chromosome 10. The polyps are predominantly (but not exclusively) in the rectosigmoid colon. There is an association with fibrocystic disease and fibroadenomas of the breast; around half of patients have breast pathology. There is a specific association with dysplastic cerebellar gangliocytoma also known as Lhermitte-Duclos disease. Patients with Cowden syndrome also develop skin lesions on the head and face called trichilemmomas which resemble tiny basal cell carcinomas.
  Turcot syndrome
This is a subtype of Familial Adenomatous Polyposis (FAP)and inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion. The polyps are adenomatous and largely colonic. They are subject to the adenoma-carcinoma sequence and thus most patients develop cancer before the reach 40 years of age. Brain tumours are also part of this disease; supratentorial glioblastomas or medulloblastomas. A patient with diarrhoea and seizures would be a typical scenario in which Turcot syndrome is diagnosed.
  Peutz-Jegher syndrome
Around half of cases are inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion but the rest are sporadic mutations to a tumour suppressing gene on chromosome 11.  Innumerable hamartomatous polyps develop throughout the gastrointestinal tract. For a firm diagnosis there should be at least 100 polyps but usually there are far more. In the large bowel the polyps can be larger and more pedunculated, putting the patient at risk of intussusceptions. Patients are also at greater risk of many different cancers (upper GI, ovary, thyroid, testis, pancreas, breast). Mucocutaneous pigmentation is classic.

Please note that the question asks which answer is NOT a contraindication.
  Prior to IVC filter placement it is important to determine:
The size of the IVC
Rule out a left IVC or duplicate IVC
The position of the renal veins
Evaluate any IVC thrombus if present
  Indications for IVC filter placement include:
PE/DVT with a contraindication to anticoagulation
Complications with standard anticoagulation
Recurrence of a PE/DVT despite adequate anticoagulation
Presence of a large IVC thrombus
  Contra-indications for IVC filter placement include:
Septic thromboemboli

Size incompatibility (IVC < 15mm. The upper limit used to be 30 mm but newer stents are now available upto 40mm)
Complete occlusion of the IVC
Deranged clotting is a relative contraindication

Please note that the question asks which is NOT a likely diagnosis. 
The differential diagnosis for orbital pathology is heavily anatomically based. Lymphangioma has to be the correct answer simply because it is not a conal lesion.

  Globe lesions are situated within the eyeball itself.
Retinoblastoma
Melanoma
Retinal detachment
Outside the globe there are three conditions which are included in all of the other orbital compartments namely sarcoidosis, pseudotumours and lymphoproliferative lesions.

  Lymphoproliferative disorders include leukaemias, lymphomas, and less aggressive collections of lymphoid tissue. The term is used particularly in head and neck radiology where histological diagnosis of such entities is key. Some masses on a CT scan can have a 'typical' appearance for a lymphoma but are actually only benign lymphoid hyperplastic tissue and thus the term lymphoproliferative disorder covers both entities accurately.
IgG4 related diseases are one of Radiology’s newest entities. They comprise a constellation of fibrotic conditions affecting virtually every part of the body, mediated by a subclass of Immunoglobulin called IgG4. Where one condition exists others may also be present. The more common of these include:
Orbital pseudotumour
Fibrosing mediastinitis
Reidel thyroiditis
Autoimmune pancreatitis
Sclerosing mesenteritis
Retroperitoneal fibrosis",FALSE,"Lymphoproliferative disorder is not a likely diagnosis for a left conal lesion. Lymphoproliferative disorder is a type of cancer that affects the lymphatic system, while the left conal lesion is likely to be related to an issue with the eye or orbit.

12681,231994,A 60-year-old man is brought to see his GP by his wife who is concerned that he is losing his memory. He is examined and referred onto a neurologist when the GP finds myoclonus. He undergoes an MRI scan which shows high signal in the putamina. There is no enhancement with contrast. What is the most likely diagnosis?,SBA: Central Nervous and Head & Neck,Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease,Kearns-Saye syndrome,Leigh syndrome,Pick disease,Huntington disease,A,63%,5%,9%,4%,20%,"Explanation:
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease
There are three types of this prion transmitted disease; the one linked to the BSE (bovine spongiform encephalopathy) epidemic of the late 1980s and 1990s, a rare familial variant and a sporadic version which accounts for the vast majority of the cases. Clinically there is a rapidly progressive dementia with ataxia and myoclonus which should be the give away feature even before imaging features are discussed. On MRI the reported finding is of high T2/FLAIR signal in the basal ganglia bilaterally and symmetrically (particularly the putamen). The pulvinar sign is often described in association with cJD which describes high FLAIR signal in the pulvinar thalamic nuclei. Strangely the signal changes are a rare cause of restriction of diffusion, seen as bright areas on DWI. Important negatives for this condition are the lack of enhancement with contrast and the lack of white matter involvement (since the white matter is protected by its myelin sheath).
  Image © Medical Exam Prep
  Kearns-Saye syndrome
This is a mitochondrial disorder presenting in adolescence or late childhood. On MRI scanning there can be basal ganglia signal changes.
  Leigh syndrome
This is another mitochondrial disorder presenting in young children. Involvement of the putamina is a strong characteristic of this disease.
  Pick disease
This condition leads to early onset dementia. When there is disproportionate atrophy of the frontal and temporal lobes in an unusually young patient Pick disease should be suspected. This can sometimes be described as enlargement of the frontal horns but the concept is the same; volume loss of the frontal and temporal lobes.
  Huntington disease
There are relatively few radiological manifestations of Huntington disease. The usual one described is atrophy of the heads of the caudate nuclei with consequential prominence of the adjacent lateral ventricle frontal horns with a ‘box’ like appearance.

Wilms tumour also known as a nephroblastoma
This is the most common abdominal mass in children under the age of 8. There are reasonably strong associations with renal anomalies, genital anomalies, aniridia and Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (although the last of these also has an association with neuroblastoma). Presentation is usually with an abdominal mass and/or pain.

  On imaging the masses are usually heterogenous. Cystic areas can often be seen secondary to areas of necrosis. The claw sign occurs when there is a rim of normal renal tissue extending part of the way around the mass. A Wilms tumour is often described as enhancing but less so than the adjacent normal renal parenchyma.

  Neuroblastoma
This is the most common solid abdominal mass in infants and second most common in children of all ages (after Wilms tumours). Most are adrenal in location, around a third develop in the retroperitoneum and a fifth are located in the posterior mediastinum. Presentation can be with abdominal pain, a mass, or a fever. Most (95%) secrete catecholamines such as VMA (vanillylmandelic acid – leads to hypertension) or VIP (vasoactive intestinal polypeptides – leads to watery diarrhoea). There are also a few distinct clinical syndromes which herald the presence of a neuroblastoma.
  Syndrome
Details
Blueberry muffin syndrome
Metastatic cutaneous deposits
Opsomyoclonus
Rapid jerky eye movements and myoclonic jerks of the legs. This occurs in around 2% of neuroblastoma cases but around 50% of patients with opsomyoclonus have a neuroblastoma.
Hutchinson syndrome
Limping due to bony metastases
  On imaging they appear as a very large abdominal mass with or without speckled calcification within in. The kidney can either be invaded or just displaced inferiorly, causing a ‘drooping lily’ appearance on urography (where contrast within the inferiorly displaced renal calyces has the appearance of a lily flower with its head hanging down). Neuroblastomas tend to encase large vessels such as the IVC, as opposed to displacing them as Wilms tumours are prone to doing. Staging is performed with an 123I-MIBG scan (as opposed to a 99mTc-MDP bone scan) and importantly within the staging it is actually stage IVs (disease involving the skin, bone marrow and liver) which has the best prognosis.
  Rhabdomyosarcoma
These aggressive lesions are the most common pelvic tumour for children under the age of 15 although they can be found anywhere in the body. Although histologically they are formed of skeletal muscle derivation, they do not have to be in continuity with normal skeletal muscle. They tend to appear low in reflectivity on ultrasound. On MRI they follow muscle on T1 weighted sequences, but enhance avidly with gadolinium.  They usually show invasive features and have a high propensity for metastatic spread.
  Burkitt lymphoma
The non-endemic form of Burkitt lymphoma comprises around a third of paediatric non-Hodgkin lymphoma cases. Most cases present as an abdominal mass or bowel obstruction due to the attachment of the mass to bowe. Owing to a rapid doubling time the original mass can be extremely large at the time of diagnosis. Often nodal disease is notably absent.
  Mature teratoma
Teratomas and dermoid cysts have very similar imaging characteristics despite their histological differences. Teratomas are are slow growing and usually benign. By contrast immature teratomas are malignant. The presence of fat is a strong indicator for a mature teratoma with the combination of fat, fluid and calcification being highly specific. On MRI the fat will show the usual signal dropout on gradient echo sequences. Calcification will show as low signal on T2. Malignant degeneration if it does occur, is to squamous cell carcinoma most commonly.",TRUE,Wilms tumour is the most likely diagnosis because it is the most common type of kidney cancer in children.

The testes are paired structures that are located within the scrotum. The primary functions of the testes are sperm production (spermatogenesis) and androgen production.
The testes have an ellipsoid shape and consist of a series of lobules, each containing seminiferous tubules supported by interstitial tissue. They have two coverings:
The tunica vaginalis, which is situated externally and covers the anterior and lateral aspects of each testis
The tunica albuginea, which is a fibrous capsule that encloses each testis and penetrates into the parenchyma to divide the testes into lobules
  The testes receive their innervation from the spermatic plexus (also referred to as the testicular plexus), a network of nerves derived from the renal plexus that receives branches from the aortic plexus.
The testes receive their arterial supply from the paired testicular arteries, which are direct branches from the abdominal aorta. They descend into the abdomen and pass into the scrotum via the inguinal canal, contained within the spermatic cord.
Venous drainage from the testes is via the paired testicular veins, which are formed from the pampiniform plexus in the scrotum. The left testicular vein drains into the left renal vein and the right testicular vein drains directly into the inferior vena cava.
Lymphatic drainage from the testes is to the paired lumbar and pre-aortic lymph nodes, which are located at the L1 vertebral level. The scrotum drains into the superficial inguinal lymph nodes.

Heterotaxy
There are two main forms of this congenital disorder:
Left sided isomerism (polysplenia)
Things that would usually be found on the left side are duplicated on the right side too. The most consistent features are the abnormalities of the spleen and IVC. The other features are commonly associated, but variably seen. The prognosis is slightly better than for asplenia syndrome as there is a lower association with congenital heart disease. There is still 75% mortality by age 5 though.
Spleen - multiple little spleens
IVC - interrupted IVC with azygos or hemiazygos continuation
Lung lobes - two on either side
Liver - situated centrally in the abdomen
Bowel - malrotation
Pancreas - truncated
Heart - ASD, VSD, PAPVR (less severe congenital heart disease)
  Right sided isomerism (asplenia)
Things that would normally be found on the right side are duplicated on the left side too. Strong association with severe congenital heart disease means the condition has a mortality rate of 80% by age 1. Beyond that, the most consistent feature is the absence of the spleen. Once again, the other features are commonly associated, but variably demonstrated.
Heart - TAPVR and other anomalies (Almost 100% have severe cyanotic congenital heart disease)
Spleen - absent
Lung lobes - three on either side (specific finding)
Liver - normal position (can be midline or malpositioned)
Bowel - malrotation
IVC - on same side as aorta (usually the right)
Kidneys - associated with horseshoe kidney
 ",FALSE,"This is the correct answer because it is a known feature of asplenia. Asplenia is a condition in which the spleen does not develop normally or is absent. It is associated with an azygos continuation of the inferior vena cava (IVC), which is an anatomical variant in which the IVC connects directly to the azygos vein, instead of the usual hepatic veins. This is in contrast to polysplenia, which is a condition in which the spleen is present but abnormally shaped or located, and is usually associated with a horseshoe kidney. TAPVR is a congenital heart defect in which there is an abnormal connection between the pulmonary artery and the systemic veins. It is not associated with either asplenia or polysplenia.",1,"3.

The limbs of the uterus are widely divergent and there is a prominent fundal cleft with a depth of at least 2cm. Two separate cervices and vaginal cavities can be seen. What is the most likely diagnosis?","SBA: Genito urinary, Adrenal, Obstetrics & Gynaecology and Breast",Uterus didelphys,Arcuate uterus,Septate uterus,"Bicornuate, bicervix uterus",Mayer-Rokitansky-Kuster-Hauser (MRKH) syndrome,A,69%,1%,3%,25%,3%,"Explanation:
Mullerian duct anomalies (MDA)
The two Mullerian ducts form separately then fuse in the first trimester to form all the structures between the upper vagina and the fallopian tubes. The final part of the amalgamation of the two sides is resorption of the central uterine septum.  There are various classification systems the scope of which is subspecialist. The following is provided for a gross overview only. Different anomalies occur depending on when during development the disruption to normality occurred.
      Aplasia/hypoplasia anomalies
Class I – Agenesis or hypoplasia:
Mayer-Rokitansky-Kuster-Hauser (MRKH) syndrome is an extreme subtype where there is complete aplasia of the upper third of the vagina and uterus. The fallopian tubes and ovaries will be seen normally. Primary amenorrhoea is the usual presentation.
Class II – Unicornuate: Banana like configuration of the remaining horn
Fusion anomalies
Class III - Didelphys: Non-fusion, two separate uterine horns, two separate cervices. All of the walls contain all of the layers of the normal uterus. The uterine cavities do not communicate with one another owing to the presence of a vaginal septum.
Class IV – Bicornuate: partial fusion, the septum separating the two horns consists of myometrium. There can be either one or two cervices depending on the degree of fusion but crucially the two uterine cavities do communicate with one another. Sometimes the appearance of a bicornuate uterus is referred to as ‘heart-shaped’.
Reabsorption (of uterine septum) anomalies
Class V – Septate: partial fusion, a fibrous remnant septum remains. This is the most common anomaly presenting as infertility.
Class VI – Arcuate: a mild form of septate uterus but which is not associated with subfertility.
The crucial diagnosis to make is that of a septate uterus. Patients with a septate uterus can present with recurrent mid-term miscarriages due to implantation on the suboptimally vascularised septum. Surgical resection of this septum can significantly improve fertility chances. Distinguishing between didelphys and bicollis bicornuate uteri can be very challenging and is beyond the scope of this text.
There is no association with abnormalities of the external genitalia or ovaries since these derive from different embryological components but renal anomalies (agenesis, ectopia, fusion) can be found in around a third of patients and should be actively sought. Infertility is the primary clinical consequence of an MDA.
  Hysterosalpingogram (HSG)
HSGs are performed in the setting of infertility to confirm or refute tubal patency. It is not the ideal modality to diagnose MDAs since it provides information only on the internal contours of any patent cavities. Historically the intercornual angle was used to differentiate between a septate uterus (<75o) and a bicornuate or didelphys uterus (>105o) but this is no longer considered reliable. In addition an HSG will overlook obstructed hemisystems or functional remnants which do not communicate with the vagina.
  Ultrasound
Differentiating between fusion anomalies (bicornuate and didelphys) and reabsorption anomalies (septate and arcuate) depends on the fundal contour. Usually this can be well seen on ultrasound. Where there has been a failure of complete fusion a fundal cleft remains. This should be at least 1cm deep.  If the patient has a septate or arcuate uterus then fusion is complete so the fundus will be domed as is normal. A normal dome is greater than 5 mm high.
  MRI
MRI is considered the gold standard for evaluating cases of MDA. The presence of menstrual blood products within an obstructed hemi uterus is, where present, readily seen as high signal on T1. Where a patient has two cervices these can be seen appearing like two ‘owl eyes’ when imaged axially to the vagina.
  Diethylstilbestrol (DES) exposure
DES was an artificial oestrogen used to treat women suffering from recurrent miscarriages. Owing to an association with clear cell carcinoma of the vagina and cervix its use was halted in the 1970s. It also caused shortening of the upper segment of the uterus which gave rise to a very characteristic T-shaped uterine cavity as seen on HSG. This was classed as a Class VII type of MDA.
  Pertinent points:
Renal agenesis, ectopia and fusion present in 33% of patients
Aplastic uterus + normal fallopian tubes and ovaries = MRKH syndrome
Widely divergent horns + fundal cleft = fusion anomaly (didelphys or bicornuate)
Two cervices also known as owl eyes on MRI = either didelphys or bicollis bicornuate (difficult to tell them apart)
No communication between two uterine horns = didelphys
Domed fundus = reabsorption anomaly (Septate or arcuate)
Recurrent midterm miscarriages can be due to septate uterus and can be surgically resected to improve fertility.",TRUE,"I chose 4.

Silicosis
Inhalation of silica leads to fibrosis. It is an occupational hazard associated with working in mines, quarries or with glass and ceramics. Chronic silicosis occurs following exposure over 10-20 years. Small nodules measuring a few millimeters in diameter form with an upper zone distribution (involvement of the upper zones is classical for inhalational diseases). Around 10% of these nodules calcify and this can be seen on imaging as multiple small foci of calcification in the upper zones.

She has declined colonoscopy and you have been asked to perform a barium enema (to which she has consented) to investigate the cause of her symptoms. The study shows a stricture in the sigmoid colon. Which of the following features would suggest a diagnosis of colorectal cancer over one of diverticular disease?,SBA: Gastrointestinal,Mucosal ulceration,A 12 cm long segment of involvement,Multiple diverticulae in the sigmoid colon,Colevesical fistula,Smoothly tapered stricture margins,A,70%,15%,1%,6%,9%,"Explanation:
A long segment measuring 12 cm or more is more suggestive of diverticular disease. Similarly the presence of smoothly tapering margins to the stricture is a feature better linked with diverticular disease. The outright presence of colonic diverticulae is very common and should not be used to downplay the possibility of cancer. Colevesical (and other) fistulas form in the presence of both diverticular disease and malignancy although they are more common with diverticular disease. Per rectum bleeding is a feature of diverticular disease however it originates from inflammation of individual diverticulae as opposed to erosion of the mucosa thus ulceration of the mucosa is a feature much more linked to the presence of malignancy.
  Diverticular disease
Diverticulosis is the presence of multiple tiny outpouchings, within the colon. Technically these are false diverticuli since they do not involve all of the layers of the colonic wall. Diverticulitis occurs when one or more of these diverticuli becomes acutely inflamed and/or infected. Diverticular disease is the term used to collect together the sequelae of multiple episodes of diverticulitis which may have resulted in abscess formation, stricturing and fistula formation.
  Rectal cancer MRI
The muscularis propria is the outer wall of the rectum and shows up as low signal on T2 weighted sequences.
Since the rectum (like the oesophagus) does not have a serosa, once spread beyond the muscularis propria into the mesorectal fat has occurred (ie a T3 tumour), nodal involvement is also feasible. The mesorectal fascia is a thin plane of connective tissue which contains fat, the rectum, local lymph nodes as a distinct anatomical entity and is of paramount importance in rectal cancer management. Spread beyond the mesorectal fascia denotes a T4 tumour. MRI is excellent for local staging of rectal cancer because the mesorectal fascia is seen clearly as a thin black line on T2 weighted sequences and its involvement or lack thereof can be readily discerned. In contrast, the tumour appears as intermediate signal on T2, distorting the normal anatomy. The fascia is also referred to as the ‘CRM’ which stands for circumferential resection margin and relates to the surgical operation performed for rectal tumours, namely a total mesorectal excision (TME). The proximity of the tumour extent to the CRM is prognostically important; tumours with a >1mm margin before they reach the CRM are far less likely to recur. A <1mm margin is taken as involvement of the CRM.",TRUE,"Mucosal ulceration is a feature that is more commonly seen in colorectal cancer than in diverticular disease. Diverticular disease is more likely to cause inflammation and narrowing of the colon, but not ulceration. The presence of mucosal ulceration is therefore a more reliable indicator of colorectal cancer than the other features listed.",2,"This question falls under category 2: A question about clinical judgement, what is the correct diagnosis?",A,TRUE,,A,,

Please note that the question asks which feature is NOT consistent with the diagnosis.
Posterior urethral valves
Posterior urethral valves is a condition restricted to baby boys and is sometimes diagnosed antenatally. The posterior urethra consists of the prostatic and membranous portions. The formation of valves here leads to outflow obstruction and dilatation of the posterior urethra. Obstruction causes the trabeculation of the bladder and reflux through the vesico-ureteric junction (which occurs more on the left than the right) causes hydronephrosis. The first line of investigation should be a micturating cystogram which will show fusiform dilatation of the posterior urethra and trabeculation of the bladder as well as any reflux. Prognosis is variable but some patients require renal replacement due to irreversible damage to the kidneys.",FALSE,"The diagnosis of posterior urethral valves is not consistent with bilateral hydronephrosis on ultrasound. Hydronephrosis is a sign of obstruction caused by an obstruction in the urinary tract, such as a urethral valve.

Stromal tumour also known as GIST (Gastrointestinal stromal tumour)
Particularly when of low staging at resection, these tumours carry an excellent prognosis. Unfortunately around half of patients present with metastatic disease owing to the relatively indolent nature of the primary lesion.

70% of GISTs occur in the stomach with most of the remainder being found in the small bowel. Clinical presentation varies slightly with the exact location but dysphagia and early satiety are common, as are sequelae from mucosal ulceration and bleeding. They can occur as a feature of neurofibromatosis type 1 and are also discussed in connection to the Carney triad (Not to be confused with Carney syndrome). On imaging they may be occult or appear as a well-circumscribed submucosal mass. The low attenuation is attributable to central necrosis within the mass. Characteristically however they tend to enlarge extraluminally into the lesser sac, gastrosplenic or gastrohepatic ligaments.

Post-operative acute mediastinitis is a known complication which patients should be adequately consented for prior to undergoing thoracic surgery. Unless the question writer has been deliberately vague and unhelpful there should be an obvious history of recent surgery or intervention. Although it occurs in only 1-2% of patients it comes with high morbidity and mortality rates and is therefore important to be able to diagnoses in a timely fashion. Since many patients undergoing cardiothoracic surgery will receive prophylactic antibiotic therapy the presentation of mediastinitis may not manifest prior to discharge from hospital. As a general rule, on CT scans, gas locules within tissue suggests either viscus rupture or fistula formation or infection.
  Boerhaave syndrome
This is oesophageal rupture with consequential extrusion of gastric contents into the pleural spaces and mediastinum. Management is usually surgical initially with many patients suffering a laborious recovery trajectory, often plagued by multitudes of complications lasting many years. Radiographically patients often have a pleural effusion at presentation, moreso on the left than the right. Acute mediastinitis can develop in the wake of an oesophageal rupture.",TRUE,"Mediastinitis is the most likely diagnosis in this case because the CT scan shows loss of the mediastinal fat planes with gas locules in the mediastinum.

The inferior vena cava carries deoxygenated blood from all of the structures lying below the diaphragm into the right atrium of the heart. It arises as the union of the right and left common iliac veins at the L5 vertebral level.
It ascends upwards in the retroperitoneal space, to the right of the lumbar vertebral bodies and to the right of the aorta. It pierces the central tendon of the diaphragm at the T8 vertebral level to enter the thorax. It then almost immediately enters the pericardium before draining into the right atrium.
The inferior vena cava receives tributaries from:
Common iliac veins (origin at L5) – drain lower limbs and gluteal regions
Lumbar veins (between L1 and L5) – drain the posterior abdominal wall
Right gonadal vein (L2) – drain the right testis/ovary
Renal veins (L1) – drain the kidneys, left adrenal gland, left testis/ovary
Right adrenal vein (L1) – drains the right adrenal gland
Right, middle and left hepatic veins (T8) – drain the liver
Right and left inferior phrenic veins (T8) – drain the diaphragm
  The inferior vena cava, its relations and tributaries (from Gray’s Anatomy)
 ",FALSE,I chose this answer because it is the only statement that accurately describes the location of the inferior vena cava. The inferior vena cava is an intraperitoneal structure that arises as the union of the right and left common iliac veins at the L3 vertebral level and pierces the central tendon of the diaphragm at the T10 vertebral level before draining into the left atrium of the heart.,1,1.

Separate lesions in separate quadrants of the breast contraindicate wide-local excision. A mastectomy would be the expected management offered in this case. Allergy to contrast or lidocaine would not preclude surgical management. Nodal enhancement would be grounds for further investigation such as ultrasound-guided biopsies but would not on their own contraindicate a WLE.",FALSE,"I chose number 3 because an allergy to lidocaine would be a contraindication to performing a wide local excision (WLE) since lidocaine is used in the procedure as a local anesthetic. Other findings, such as enhancement of axillary or internal mammary nodes, the presence of an additional lesion with enhancement in the LLO quadrant, or an allergy to iodinated contrast, would not necessarily be contraindications to performing a WLE.",2,"This question falls under category 2: A question about clinical judgement, what is the correct diagnosis?",D,TRUE,,A,,

13752,231994,You are reviewing a CT scan of a 3-year-old girl who has complained of frequent headaches. More recently she has developed neck pain and vomiting. There is an asymmetric mass in the pons which is isodense to the gray matter but the 4th ventricle is flattened posteriorly and there is significant hydrocephalus. What is the most likely diagnosis?,SBA: Paediatrics,Pontine astrocytoma,Pilocytic astrocytoma,Medulloblastoma,Ependymoma,Lymphoma,A,64%,7%,19%,10%,1%,"Explanation:
The best answer to this question would be a brainstem glioma however this is not listed as an option. However, gliomas encompass astrocytomas, oligodendrogliomas and ependymomas or can be a mixture of the three cell types.
Astrocytomas are the most common brain tumour in children. Classically they appear as a posterior fossa cyst with an enhancing mural nodule but about 10% are solid in nature. Solid (uncalcified) components are isodense to gray matter. This differentiates them from a medulloblastoma which will be hyperattenuating. Calcification is reasonably common with astrocytomas and this will obviously appear dense on CT. For the size of the mass there is often surprisingly little adjacent cerebral oedema with an astrocytoma. Any solid component will enhance with contrast.
Medulloblastomas are the most common posterior fossa tumours in children. > 90% appear hyperdense on CT despite the absence of calcification.
Ependymomas also occur in the paediatric cohort. They predominate in the 4th ventricle, and show T1 hypointensity with foci of high T2 signal. They are the ‘toothpaste’ tumour, expanding out through the foramina of Magendie and Luschka.
  Most common paediatric brain tumours according to site:
All Astrocytoma
Posterior fossa Medulloblastoma
Brainstem Brainstem glioma 
Ventricles - lateral Choroid plexus papilloma
Ventricles - 3rd Choroid plexus papilloma = Ependymoma
Ventricles - 4th Ependymoma
 ",FALSE,"Ependymoma is the most likely diagnosis because it is the most common type of brain tumor found in children and is often associated with hydrocephalus. The CT scan findings of an asymmetric mass in the pons that is isodense to the gray matter and a flattened fourth ventricle are consistent with ependymoma. Other tumors such as pilocytic astrocytoma, medulloblastoma, lymphoma, and pontine astrocytoma are less likely given the patient's age and the CT scan findings.",2,,A,TRUE,,A,,
11406,231994,A 58-year-old man taking warfarin for atrial fibrillation attends a pre-assessment clinic prior to a renal biopsy. He received a cadaveric transplant kidney following post-traumatic resection of both of his native kidneys and his renal physician is concerned the transplanted kidney is not functioning adequately. The interventional radiologist is concerned regarding the risk of bleeding for the procedure. Which of the following is the most appropriate plan for managing this man?,"SBA: Genito urinary, Adrenal, Obstetrics & Gynaecology and Breast","Stop warfarin 5 days before biopsy, recheck INR on the day","stop 24 hrs before biopsy, no vitamin K needed, recheck INR on the day",oral vitamin K on the day of the biopsy and recheck INR prior the procedure,IV vitamin K on the day of the biopsy,"Stop warfarin 5 days before biopsy, oral vitamin K on the day of the biopsy",A,72%,11%,4%,2%,10%,"Explanation:
Warfarin therapy is becoming less and less popular with the advent of factor Xa inhibitors which need far less monitoring. Warfarin should be stopped 5 days before a renal biopsy and can be restarted the following day assuming there is no evidence to suggest bleeding. Vitamin K need only be given if a renal procedure cannot wait the requisite 5 days and the effects of warfarin need rapid reversal. Checking the INR on the day of the procedure is standard practice for patients taking warfarin.",TRUE,"I chose this option because it is the most conservative approach to managing the patient's anticoagulation prior to the biopsy. This option allows for the warfarin to be stopped 5 days before the biopsy, which gives the patient enough time for their anticoagulation to be reversed. Additionally, this option allows for the INR to be rechecked on the day of the biopsy, which will help to ensure that the patient is not at an increased risk of bleeding. This approach is therefore the safest and most appropriate plan for managing this patient.",2,"3. A question about clinical management, what is the best plan of action?

The crescenteric high signal in the question is the ‘sickle sign’ or ‘fried egg’ sign refers to the appearance of T1 fat saturated sequences where a slice transverse through the vessel shows hyperintensity in a crescenteric or circumferential shape to the wall of the affected vessel. Fat saturated T1 sequences may be the most sensitive sequence for cerebral artery dissections but similar findings can still be seen on T2. Unlike large vessel dissections the anatomy here is usually too small to see a dissection flap.
The other classic cause of a Horner syndrome might be an ipsilateral PCOM or PCA aneurysm. A vertebral artery dissection can cause a Horner syndrome due to lateral medullary syndrome. Vertebral artery dissections are most commonly seen in the setting of trauma, and are altogether much rare than internal carotid artery dissections.",FALSE,"The description of ‘T2 crescentic high signal’ on the MRI is indicative of subacute subarachnoid haemorrhage, which is a type of bleeding that occurs in the space between the brain and the skull.

Other possible causes are sarcoidosis or tuberculous prostatitis. Aside from these, more recently purely idiopathic cases have also been noted. In these cases a recent UTI or urethral instrumentation have been implicated. The imaging appearances are reminiscent of a PI-RADS 5/5 prostate cancer and the diagnosis should always be made histologically. Whatever the aetiology, the patient followed up to resolution of imaging abnormalities to ensure a prostate cancer has not been masked.
Squamous cell carcinoma of the prostate accounts for very few prostate cancers.

11751,231994,A baby born at 41 weeks develops respiratory distress. A CXR shows bilateral diffuse patchy opacities with no air bronchograms visible. What is the most likely diagnosis?,SBA: Paediatrics,Meconium aspiration,Transient tachypnoea of the newborn,Pulmonary interstitial emphysema,Hyaline membrane disease,Bronchopulmonary dysplasia,A,72%,23%,1%,3%,1%,"Explanation:
Of the five main respiratory conditions of the neonate, the differential diagnosis can be narrowed based on gestational age.  The presence of hyperinflation can also be useful but may not always be present where feasible so should not be used as an absolute discriminator. If present, it is useful
    Meconium aspiration
Meconium is sticky and causes a chemical pneumonitis in the lungs, seen as patchy consolidation. In addition small globules of meconium entering bronchi and bronchioles of a decreasing calibre act as a ball-valve mechanism and lead to air trapping; thus the lung volumes of a baby with meconium aspiration may be increased. Air bronchograms are notably absent.
  Transient tachypnoea of the newborn (TTN)
The classical patient for TTN would be a term baby born by caesarean section to a diabetic mother. During normal vaginal delivery the compression of the baby as it descends the birth canal acts to squeeze fluid out from its lungs. This mechanism is all but absent during a caesarean section.  Consequently these babies are born with an excess of retained fluid. The CXR of an affected baby will show bilateral symmetrical air space opacification with air bronchograms, fluid in the fissures and pleural effusions. This peaks in severity at 24hrs but resolves by three days.
  Hyaline Membrane Disease (HMD) also known as surfactant deficient disease (SDD)
It is to reduce the likelihood of this disease developing that a woman in pre-term labour will be offered a steroid injection. The steroids help the neonatal lungs to develop faster and increase the likelihood of their being able to produce surfactant once delivered. Where there is surfactant deficiency the alveoli collapse. The CXR will show a granular opacification throughout both lungs which progresses to bilateral ground glass opacification with air bronchograms. If exogenous surfactant is given to the baby there may be asymmetrical improvement in the appearances depending on how much reaches each lung. Of note HMD does not cause pleural effusions. Finally a normal CXR at 6hrs post delivery excludes HMD.
  Pulmonary interstitial emphysema (PIE)
As the name would suggest, this disease is diagnosed when there is air within the interstitial tissues of the lungs. It is caused by alveolar rupture due to the barotrauma of mechanical ventilation or positive airway pressure.  It can be associated with hyaline membrane disease and is prevalent in infants of a low birth weight. Complications such as pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum can be severe and acutely life threatening. Radiographically there is hyperinflation and lucencies in either a cystic pattern or streaks emanating from the hila and following the direction of the bronchi/bronchioles. It is treated with high frequency oscillation ventilation which is less traumatic to the lungs.
  Bronchopulmonary dysplasia
This also occurs due to barotrauma in ventilated neonates but is a more gradual process, occurring later on in the baby’s life. Typically (but not exclusively) the baby is premature (hence requiring ventilation). It only usually occurs after the baby in question has received ventilation of >21% oxygen for longer than 28 days. The lungs are hyperinflated and what starts off as ground glass opacification becomes complete opacification with air bronchograms in a few days. After 30 days it can be seen as coarse linear lucencies, described as radiating from the hila, with focal emphysematous change. Mikity syndrome has similar features but occurs in term infants who have not received mechanical assistance.",FALSE,"Hyaline membrane disease is the most likely diagnosis in this case because it is the most common cause of respiratory distress in newborns. It is characterized by bilateral diffuse patchy opacities with no air bronchograms visible, which is what is seen in the CXR. The other options are less likely in this case.",2,"2.

9031,231994,"A 32-year-old man who has recently undergone a total colectomy as part of management of his ulcerative colitis, presents with jaundice. An ultrasound is performed by one of your junior colleagues who asks for your assistance. He thinks he has seen some duct dilatation. What would be the most likely diagnosis?",SBA: Gastrointestinal,Sclerosing cholangitis,Primary biliary cirrhosis,Cholecystitis,Caroli disease,Cholangiocarcinoma,A,74%,13%,1%,3%,9%,"Explanation:
Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC)
Although benign in nature PSC can wreak havoc for patients unfortunate enough to develop it. It is twice as common in men as in women and 70% of patients have a history of inflammatory bowel disease. Bile duct strictures form (particularly at the bifurcation/confluence of ducts) and lead to an obstructive jaundice picture. In between strictures there is dilatation and the combination of the two leads to a string of beads type appearance. The appearance on ERCP or MRCP in some patients can also resemble a tree in winter with pruning of the upstream branches. Outpouchings also form which are either true or pseudo-diverticulae. Hepatic atrophy is present in chronic cases, although the caudate lobe is usually spared. Patients unfortunately have a higher risk of developing cholangiocarcinoma.
  Primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC)
This can be difficult to distinguish from PSC however whereas PSC can involve both intra and extrahepatic ducts, PBC only involves the intrahepatic ducts. It is an autoimmune condition and, like many other autoimmune conditions, patients are typically women in their middle ages. Antimitochondrial antibodies (AMA) are present in the vast majority of patients. On imaging, the secondary cirrhotic effects are most pertinent with caudate lobe hypertrophy and left lobar atrophy. The periportal halo sign as seen on MRI is reasonably specific and relates to fluid accumulation around the portal triad.
  Choledochal cyst
Reflux of pancreatic enzymes into the common bile duct  leads to weakening of the wall of the common bile duct [CBD] (+/- the common hepatic duct) and thereafter aneurysmal dilatation termed a choledochal cyst. There are five different subtypes. Patients are mostly diagnosed in childhood.  If undiagnosed to adulthood patients present with a triad of episodic jaundice, right upper quadrant pain and a right upper quadrant mass.
Type I – This is by far the most common version. The common bile duct is affected either focally or along its entire length.
Type II – A true diverticulum of the CBD
Type III – Focal dilatation of the CBD contained within the wall of the duodenum. This type is also called a choledochocoele. They present slightly later with most patients being in their 30s at the time of diagnosis and can be seen as a duodenal filling defect on barium follow-through studies.
Type IV – The intrahepatic and extrahepatic biliary ducts are affected
Type V – The intraheptic ducts are affected alone. This is termed Caroli disease however there is some discrepancy in the literature as to whether this can be called a type V choledochal cyst or whether it is a separate disease in its own right. Caroli disease (cavernous ectasia of the intrahepatic ducts) can be inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion. When present it is quite striking on imaging with saccular dilatation of most of the larger intrahepatic biliary ducts alongside focal strictures giving a beaded appearance. There is an association with medullary sponge kidney and patients are at significantly increased risk of developing cholangiocarcinoma.
  Cholangiocarcinoma
Any disease which causes chronic biliary inflammation predisposes the patient to developing cholangiocarcinoma, a malignancy of the biliary tree. In particular, inflammatory bowel disease poses a 10 times greater risk. Painless jaundice is the presenting feature in around one in ten patients but mostly patients present more insidiously with abdominal pain or weight loss.
Cholangiocarcinomas can be intra or extrahepatic and a few of the pertinent features of each are listed in the table below.
                   Extrahepatic                  
Intrahepatic
90% (Right > left)
10%
Fluctuating painless jaundice
Painful or painless jaundice, weight loss
Ductal strictures
Satellite nodules
  A Klatskin tumour is an intrahepatic tumour arising at the confluence of the left and right hepatic ducts where they join to form the common hepatic duct. Consequently it obstructs both ducts separately. On MRCP or ERCP this is seen as duct dilatation where the left and right ducts fail to communicate with one another. The location is relevant in identifying this type of tumours since they tend to be aggressive in nature, even for cholangiocarcinomas.
On ultrasound a cholangiocarcinoma can have a variable appearance. Duct dilatation, if present, should be evident. On CT the tumour will be hypodense but can show early rim enhancement with contrast, followed by filling-in leading to homogeneous delayed enhancement by around 15minutes. Thereafter there is washout which, again, begins peripherally. Appearances therefore depend hugely on the phase of the scan. Since cholangiocarcinomas do not derive from hepatocytes they do not take up sulphur colloid and thus will appear cold on a sulphur colloid scan.
  Cholecystitis
When a gallstone becomes lodged in the neck of the gallbladder, chemical irritation from the trapped bile leads to inflammation of the gallbladder. Sometimes this can be felt by the patient as shoulder pain since irritation of the gallbladder is felt via C3, 4 and 5 the dermatomes of which cover the shoulder. Mostly, however, patients complain of right upper quadrant pain. With an accurate history this should be distinguishable from the pain caused by biliary colic, the latter being intermittent in nature and lasting less than six hours per episode.
On ultrasound the earliest signs will be of gallstones in the presence of a sonographic Murphy sign. Clinically Murphy sign is maximal tenderness when palpating over the gallbladder and the addition of ultrasound allows for greater specificity in this regard. The presence of pericholecystic fluid and increasing thickness of the gallbladder wall (>3mm) are also common findings, but come slightly later on. With CT similar findings can be seen with the addition of enhancement of the adjacent liver due to reactive hyperaemia. The presence of gallstones can be easily masked on CT since they are often of equal density to the bile.
Nuclear medicine tests would not usually be part of the index management of cholecystitis however can be used to determine cytic duct patency. Non-visualisation of the gallbladder at four hours following injection of 99mTc-HIDA is reported to be 99% specific in the diagnosis of cholecystitis.
Acalculous cholecystitis can also occur, often in the setting of an already unwell patient on ITU. It will present as generic sepsis and it is usually down to the clinical team to retain a high index of suspicioun. It is thought to be a consequence of low blood flow in the cystic artery.
Emphysematous cholecystitis signifies a gas-producing organism such as Clostridium or E-coli. Appearances are striking on imaging with ring-down or reverberation artefacts on ultrasound and mural gas seen on CT. Patients are typically (but not exclusively) diabetic or suffering from a debilitating condition. Unfortunately the mortality rate is significantly higher than for non-emphysematous cholecystitis.
Mirizzi syndrome can present as cholecystitis and occurs when the common hepatic duct is obstructed by the mechanical pressure of a stone within the cystic duct. It follows that patients whose cystic duct happens to insert low in the course of the common hepatic duct are predisposed to this condition.",TRUE,"Sclerosing cholangitis is the most likely diagnosis in this case because it is a condition that can be caused by a total colectomy, which the patient has recently undergone. It is characterized by inflammation and scarring of the bile ducts, which can lead to duct dilatation as seen on ultrasound. Other conditions such as primary biliary cirrhosis, cholecystitis, Caroli disease, and cholangiocarcinoma can also lead to jaundice, but they are less likely in this case given the patient's medical history.",2,,B,TRUE,,A,,
12721,231994,You are performing an outpatient transvaginal ultrasound scan on a 27-year-old lady to assess her recent IUCD. There is a 4 cm irregular collection associated with the right adnexa. The endometrium is slightly thick and you also see a linear hyperreflective area. What is the most likely explanation?,"SBA: Genito urinary, Adrenal, Obstetrics & Gynaecology and Breast",Ectopic pregnancy,Pelvic inflammatory disease,Tubo-ovarian abscess,Hydrosalpinx,Pyosalpinx,A,39%,17%,30%,6%,7%,"Explanation:
IUCDs work by thinning the endometrium so the presence of a thick endometrium in addition to the other given finding of a complex adnexal mass must increase the level of suspicion.
  IUCD - Intrauterine contraceptive device
There is an accepted failure rate with all methods of contraception and IUCDs are no exception. Quoted figures vary from source to source but are around 1% or less. Contraceptive failure is most likely to occur within the first 12 months following insertion. The risk of an ectopic location to any co-existent pregnancy is higher than it would be without the presence of an IUCD. On ultrasound the IUCD will be seen as a brightly reflective straight line within the endometrial cavity, posterior acoustic shadowing may also be seen.
  Tuboovarian abscess (TOA)
A TOA can arise as a complication of PID. They therefore share the same aetiology of sexually transmitted infections, IUD insertion or pelvic surgery. They are ususally seen as a complex mass which encompasses the fallopian tube and ovary and it may not even be possible to accurately distinguish the anatomy of the fallopian tube or the exact location of the ovary within the mass. Unlike other pelvic abscesses a TOA usually forms posterior to the uterus, displacing the broad ligament anteriorly. Otherwise, imaging features are common to many other abscesses , namely a complex mass with thick enhancing walls and septae, and the liquid centre of which is low on T1 and high on T2 weighted sequences. They are often bilateral.
  Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID)
This is a coverall term applied to ascending infection of the genital tract. It encompasses endometriosis, salpingitis, hydrosalpinx, pyosalpinx, and tubo-ovarian abscesses. Chlamydia and gonorrhoea account of most of the cases and the disease is most prevalent in sexually active young people. Imaging features are those secondary to inflammation with increased vascularity to the endometrium and small volume ascites. Inflammation is also seen on MRI as avid enhancement post contrast. Pelvic inflammatory disease can be complicated by a condition called Fitz-Hugh-Curtis syndrome where there is perihepatitis secondary to PID. 
  Hydrosalpinx - A simple tubular structure with thin enhancing walls
Fluid within the fallopian tube is referred to as a hydrosalpinx. This can occur as a complication of endometriosis or PID and will be seen on imaging as a fluid-filled adnexal structure, distinct from the ovary. The walls are most often thin. On MRI the signal characteristics will depend on the protein content of the fluid but usually they are watery and therefore are low in signal on T1 and high in signal on T2.
  Pyosalpinx -  A tubular structure with thick enhancing walls
A pyosalpinx can be seen within a TOA or can exist as a separate entity in its own right but the presence of a pyosalpinx does not completely stretch to a diagnosis of a TOA.

11676,231994,An 8-year-old boy presents with acute right testicular pain which woke him up during the night. He undergoes an ultrasound which shows both testes to be identical on all parameters. What is the most likely diagnosis?,SBA: Paediatrics,Testicular torsion,Epididymo-orchitis,Seminoma,Lymphoma,Leukaemia,A,81%,10%,1%,5%,4%,"Explanation:
Testicular torsion
Testicular torsion is a surgical emergency with salvage rates dropping sharply beyond the first six hours. A normal ultrasound scan does not exclude testicular torsion, particularly if performed within the first six hours. Acute unilateral pain beginning at night is a typical history and the peak age range is in either newborn boys or young adolescents (13-16 years). Ultrasound features, if present, are as follows:
Hypoechoic compared to the normal side (after 6 hours)
Heterogenous if there is ischaemic necrosis present (after 24 hours)
Enlarged (after 8 hours)
Absent Doppler signal (incomplete torsion can show flow)
Twisting of the spermatic cord with spiralling vessels
  Missed torsion
Where ultrasound features of heterogeneous testis with increased peri-testicular flow but absent testicular flow are found in a patient with symptoms lasting longer than 24 hours, a missed torsion can be diagnosed.
  Chronic torsion
Beyond around 10 days the testicle becomes small and homogeneously hypoechoic with an enlarged and echogenic epididymis.
  Reversed torsion also known as torsion-detorsion sequence
Increased blood flow within the testicle is either caused by infection or reversed torsion (a testicular tumour can also show increased blood flow).",FALSE,"I chose 1. Epididymo-orchitis because it is the most likely diagnosis for an 8-year-old boy presenting with acute right testicular pain which woke him up during the night and an ultrasound which shows both testes to be identical on all parameters. Epididymo-orchitis is an inflammation of the epididymis (a tube that carries sperm) and the testes which can cause pain, swelling, and tenderness. It is a common cause of acute testicular pain and is more common in young boys than adults.",2,,A,TRUE,,A,,

May-Thurner Syndrome
This condition causes recurrent left leg swelling and left sided deep vein thrombosis due to obstruction of the left common iliac vein where it is crossed by the right common iliac artery.

As well as multiple thoracic abnormalities you also notice that the pancreas seems to be absent. What is the LEAST likely diagnosis? Select ONE answer only.,SBA: Paediatrics,Type 1 diabetes,Cystic fibrosis,Shwachman-Diamond syndrome,Pancreatic Lipomatous Pseudohypertrophy,Retroperitoneal liposarcoma,A,27%,20%,10%,7%,37%,"Explanation:
Please note that the question asks for the LEAST likely option.
  Cystic fibrosis
An absent finding such as asplenia can be harder to detect than the presence of an abnormality. In cystic fibrosis the pancreatic parenchyma becomes entirely replaced by fatty infiltration to such an extent that it blends almost imperceptibly with the intra-abdominal fat and appears completely absent. Patients suffer from pancreatic failure and require high dose enzyme replacement.
  Pancreatic lipomatous pseudohypertrophy
As the name would suggest, this condition involves fatty replacement of the pancreatic tissue and is a mimic of the findings in cystic fibrosis.
  Shwachman-Diamond syndrome
This very rare syndrome is a differential diagnosis for pancreatic insufficiency. It also causes short stature and aplastic anaemia due to bone marrow dysfunction.
  Retroperitoneal liposarcoma
The finding of a fatty mass in the retroperitoneum should always spark the consideration of a liposarcoma. Most contain some soft tissue components and present as a heterogenous mass whereas in the other differential diagnoses given here the outline of the pancreas is usually just about discernible.",FALSE,"Pancreatic Lipomatous Pseudohypertrophy is a rare disorder that affects the pancreas and is usually seen in children and adolescents. This disorder is typically characterized by an enlarged pancreas and fat infiltration of the pancreas, which can cause the pancreas to appear absent on a CT scan. However, this disorder is not associated with trauma and would not be the most likely diagnosis in this case.",2,"This question falls under category 2: A question about clinical judgement, what is the correct diagnosis?",D,TRUE,,A,,

Select ONE answer only.,SBA: Musculoskeletal and Trauma,"T1 fat sat and STIR, coronal SIJs and sagittal spine","T1 fat sat pre and post contrast and STIR, coronal SIJs and sagittal spine","T2 fat sat and STIR, axial SIJs and coronal spine","T1 fat sat and T2, sagittal SIJs and axial spine","T1 fat sat pre and post contrast and T2, axial SIJs and sagittal spine",A,61%,23%,10%,2%,4%,"Explanation:
T1 fat sat - useful for visualisation of bony erosions and new bone formation
T1 fat sat post contrast - useful for detecting bone marrow abnormalities (but so is STIR, so contrast is not an absolute requirement for imaging ankylosing spondylitis).
STIR - useful for detecting bone marrow abnormalities in the SIJs and spine
T2 fat sat - useful for detecting oedema
  Coronal SIJ - ideally this should be taken parallel to the long axis of the sacrum, the better to view the SIJs, both SIJs can be seen on each image for comparison.
Axial SIJ - ideally this should be at 90 degrees to the modified coronal plane and is used to evaluate the ligamentous portion of the SIJs.
Axial spine - useful if co-existing disc herniation present but not ordinarily included otherwise
Sagittal spine - useful to evaluate facet and costovertebral joints
  Ankylosing spondylitis
This disease usually presents in early adulthood with gradual onset of back pain. There is a male preponderance, though it can affect women too. The vast majority (>90%) of patients are HLA-B27 positive. Radiologically the late features are classical with:
Bilateral symmetrical sacroiliitis
Enthesopathy - calcified tendon insertion sites
Bamboo spine - vertebral syndesmophytes, particularly in the thoracolumbar spine
Dagger sign - spinous process fusion
Erosion, then fusion at the symphysis pubis, costochondral, costovertebral and sternoclavicular joints
Thoracic manifestations: upper lobe pulmonary fibrosis, pericarditis, aortic root dilatation
Early features are far more subtle and require a higher index of suspicion
Enthesopathy - high signal on MRI at tendon insertion sites
Romanus lesions - triangular shaped oedema at the corners of vertebral bodies
Andersson lesions - bony oedema in the vertebral bodies adjacent to the disks.
Oedema in the sacroiliac joints.
  Patients with advanced ankylosing spondylitis are at increased risk of pathological fractures due to fusion. These can be pelvic fractures following a simple fall, or chance fractures of the spine (involving all three columns - in ankylosing spondylitis, these fractures are also sometimes termed chalk-stick or carrot fractures).",FALSE,"I chose option 5 because it is the best sequence to confirm a diagnosis of ankylosing spondylitis. T1 fat sat pre and post contrast and T2 sequences are the most sensitive for detecting inflammation and erosions, which are key features of ankylosing spondylitis. Additionally, axial SIJs and sagittal spine sequences are the most appropriate for visualizing the sacroiliac joints and spine, respectively, which are also important for diagnosing ankylosing spondylitis.",3,3.

14465,231994,Ureteric stones are most likely to become lodged in which of the following points? Select ONE answer only.,"SBA: Genito urinary, Adrenal, Obstetrics & Gynaecology and Breast",At the bifurcation of the common iliac arteries,At the inferior border of the transverse colon,2 cm distal to the renal hila,Near the inferior pole of the kidney,At the level of the ischial tuberosities,A,52%,1%,20%,4%,23%,"Explanation:
The ureters are two muscular ducts that carry urine from the kidneys to the urinary bladder. They are usually 25-30 cm long and approximately 3-4 mm in diameter. They lie in the retroperitoneal space.
They arise from the pelvis of the kidney and exit at the hila in the transpyloric plane at the L1 vertebral level. From the hilum they run vertically downwards, passing along the anterior surface of psoas major. They cross the pelvic brim at close to the sacroiliac joints to enter the pelvic cavity. At this point the cross the bifurcation of the common iliac arteries.
Once within the pelvis they turn anteromedially at the level of the ischial spines, to head towards the bladder. Upon reaching the bladder they pierce its lateral aspect in an oblique fashion. This creates a valve that prevents the backflow of urine.
The ureters contain three points of constriction. These are important clinically as the most common sites for kidney stones to become lodged:
At the ureteropelvic junction of the renal pelvis and the ureter
As the ureter crosses the bifurcation of the common iliac arteries to enter the pelvis
At the ureterovesical junction as the ureter obliquely enters the bladder
  The ureter lies in close association with several important abdominopelvic viscera including the appendix, colon and ovaries. This places the ureter at risk from inflammatory, infectious, or malignant processes from these viscera and these can manifest as haematuria, pyuria, fistula, or obstruction. The mass effect of constipation, pregnancy, or ovarian cysts can cause ureteric obstruction.
Sensory input from the ureters travels to the T11-L2 levels of the spinal cord and can be referred to the corresponding dermatomes. Pain from the ureter, for example form ureteric colic, may therefore be referred to the posterior lumbar/flank region or the hypogastrium.

 ",FALSE,"I chose this answer because the ureteric stone is most likely to become lodged at the narrowest point of the ureter, which is 2 cm distal to the renal hila. The renal hila are the points at which the renal arteries enter the kidneys and the ureter exits the kidneys, so the area 2 cm distal to this point is the narrowest part of the ureter, making it the most likely place for a stone to become lodged.",1,"3.

Recent routine screening has shown an abnormally elevated PSA. What is the most likely diagnosis? Select ONE answer only.,"SBA: Genito urinary, Adrenal, Obstetrics & Gynaecology and Breast",Metastases,Lymphoma,Leukaemia,Sarcoidosis,Bilateral germ cell tumours,A,64%,31%,1%,2%,3%,"Explanation:
The differential diagnosis for bilateral testicular masses is reasonably short. Lymphoma is the most likely cause, especially in men aged over 60. Sarcoidosis is also a common cause of this uncommon finding. Leukaemia is difficult to differentiate from lymphoma on imaging alone and the two are usually discussed in tandem. Testicular metastases are themselves rare, but most common in patients over the age of 50 and the primary site is most commonly prostate or lung.
Lymphoma and leukaemia
Testicular lymphoma is uncommon but important. In men over the age of 60 it is the most common testicular malignancy and in men of any age it is the most common bilateral testicular malignancy (although it is not always bilateral). On ultrasound it appears either as a diffusely hypoechoic and enlarged testicle or as multiple hypoechoic masses.
The finding of a germ cell tumour, or bilateral ones, would be unusual at this age, though not impossible.",FALSE,"Bilateral germ cell tumours are the most likely diagnosis in this case, as they are the most common testicular tumours in adults and can cause elevated PSA levels.

Select ONE answer only.",SBA: Musculoskeletal and Trauma,Chondroblastoma,Unicameral bone cyst,Intraosseous lipoma,Geode,Pseudo-cyst of calcaneus,A,43%,8%,44%,2%,3%,"Explanation:
Chondroblastoma
The calcaneus, like the patella, is an epiphyseal equivalent, so any epiphyseal lesions should be considered a possibility in this bone. They usually arise eccentrically in the epiphysis, are lobulated with a thin sclerotic margin.
  Pseudo-cyst of calcaneus
This is a variation of the normal trabecular pattern centrally within the calcaneus. Will not have a crisp edge for this reason. Persistence of thin trabeculae and a visible nutrient foramen are supporting features.
  Unicameral bone cyst
This is a well-defined lesion with thin sclerotic edges and potentially a multiloculated appearance. Absence of calcification within the lesion is a key differentiator from intraosseous lipoma, although if fractured, a fallen fragment sign can be seen.
  Intraosseous lipoma
Calcification within the center of this lesion is a key feature which differentiates it from other lesions of plain film. Fat density on CT or MRI would also be a key differentiator. There should not be a periosteal reaction associated with this lesion, even in the presence of an acute fracture.
  Geode
This is a subchondral cyst associated with osteoarthritis which should have communication with the joint space and be present in an older patient.",FALSE,"Unicameral bone cysts are the most likely diagnosis for this radiolucent lesion in the calcaneus. This is because these cysts typically have a thin sclerotic edge, calcification within, endosteal scalloping, and a subtle periosteal reaction, which are all characteristics seen in this case. Other lesions such as intraosseous lipomas, geodes, pseudo-cysts of calcaneus, and chondroblastomas usually have different radiographic features and/or clinical presentations.",2,,B,TRUE,,A,,

A 5 cm fat-dense lesion is also seen within the right kidney. Which of the following syndromes is the most accurate description of this clinical presentation? Select ONE answer only.,"SBA: Genito urinary, Adrenal, Obstetrics & Gynaecology and Breast",Wunderlich syndrome,Tuberous sclerosis,Tuberculosis,Paraneoplastic syndrome,Majewski Syndrome,A,71%,25%,1%,1%,3%,"Explanation:
Wunderlich syndrome
Spontaneous haemorrhage/rupture is a known complication of AMLs and is termed Wunderlich syndrome. Patients with AMLs larger than 4cm are at particularly increased risk of this. Wunderlich syndrome can occur in the context of Tuberous Sclerosis or in a patient with an isolated large AML. Although Wunderlich syndrome is most commonly caused by an underlying AML, it can also be seen with renal cell carcinoma or vascular malformations.
  Tuberous sclerosis
This condition would explain the presence of a fat containing renal lesion (AML) which is the underlying cause of the haematoma in this case, however it does not describe the main presentation of spontaneous haemorrhage. Not all patients with tuberous sclerosis have AMLs and not all of those with AMLs have large enough ones to rupture, and not all of those with large AMLs experience Wunderlich syndrome.

9006,231994,A 34-year-old man is clinically suspected to have a small bowel carcinoid tumour. What would be the best test to confirm this diagnosis?,SBA: Gastrointestinal,Octreotide scan,Small bowel MRI,MIBG scan,USS,Dual phase CT,A,89%,1%,8%,0%,2%,"Explanation:
Carcinoid
These tumours are relatively low-grade and slow growing. The small bowel is the most common location for the primary lesion and they are also the most common lesion found in the appendix, though usually the diagnosis is made incidentally when the surgical specimen is examined post appendicectomy. Otherwise, they tend to present insidiously however and therefore are often found to have metastasized by the time of diagnosis. The classical appearance on CT is of a mesenteric soft-tissue density mass containing flecks of calcification and causing a striking desmoplastic reaction in the adjacent mesentry giving it a spiculated appearance. This mass is not the primary tumour but rather a mesenteric metastatic mass. The primary itself may be too small to appreciate with CT but can sometimes be seen as a small arterially enhancing lesion. They can be seen in isolation or in the context of MEN 1 or MEN 2a.
The so-called carcinoid syndrome of flushing, diarrhoea, and bronchospasm occurs when serotonin is released by hepatic metastases into the systemic circulation. Around one in ten patients with a small bowel carcinoid present in this way. Heart failure can also occur due to fibrosis of the tricuspid and pulmonary valves secondary to the excess serotonin levels. On imaging the hepatic metastases are hypervascular, much like the primary lesion would be. There is a direct correlation between the size of the primary lesion and the likelihood of metastasis with 80% of those >20mm in diameter having nodal metastases and around half having hepatic metastases at the time of diagnosis.
Nuclear medicine is useful in the localisation and staging of carcinoid tumours.
111I-Octreotide: This has the highest sensitivity of the two and is taken up by hepatic metastases as well as the primary lesion. It is used for initial staging and for assessing disease response following treatment.
123I-MIBG: This is a useful test for localising the 10% of carcinoid tumours which do not take up Octreotide.",TRUE,"Octreotide scan is the best test to confirm a diagnosis of small bowel carcinoid tumour. This scan uses a radioactive form of octreotide, a hormone that is specifically taken up by neuroendocrine tumours, including carcinoid tumours.

11791,231994,A mother brings her 4 day old baby back to the post-natal ward. She is worried that he is not feeding well and seems more lethargic. He was born at term following induction for prolonged rupture of membranes. A CXR shows bilateral patchy infiltrates with a right sided pleural effusion. What is the most likely diagnosis?,SBA: Paediatrics,Streptococcal pneumonia (Group B),Meconium aspiration,Transient tachypnoea of the newborn,Pneumococcal pneumonia,Listeria pneumonia,A,69%,18%,8%,3%,1%,"Explanation:
Neonatal pneumonia
Group B strep (GBS) is a beta-haemolytic bacterium known to cause pneumonia in neonates. Factors increasing the risk of developing neonatal GBS pneumonia include:
Prematurity
Long labour
Complicated labour
Prolonged rupture of membranes
GBS is the most common cause of neonatal pneumonia and, unlike other bacteria, causes pleural effusions.
Other causes of neonatal pneumonia are listeria, pneumococci, candida and chlamydia.
  Meconium aspiration
Meconium is sticky and causes a chemical pneumonitis in the lungs, seen as patchy consolidation. In addition small globules of meconium entering bronchi and bronchioles of a decreasing calibre act as a ball-valve mechanism and lead to air trapping; thus the lung volumes of a baby with meconium aspiration may be increased. Air bronchograms are notably absent. The typical baby in a meconium aspiration situation is post-term.
  Transient tachypnoea of the newborn (TTN)
The classical patient for TTN would be a term baby born by caesarean section to a diabetic mother. During normal vaginal delivery the compression of the baby as it descends the birth canal acts to squeeze fluid out from its lungs. This mechanism is all but absent during a caesarean section. Consequently these babies are born with an excess of retained fluid. The CXR of an affected baby will show bilateral symmetrical air space opacification with air bronchograms, fluid in the fissures and pleural effusions. This peaks in severity at 24hrs but resolves by three days.
 ",TRUE,"I chose number 1, Streptococcal pneumonia (Group B), as the most likely diagnosis because it is the most common cause of pneumonia in newborns. It is also the most common cause of prolonged rupture of membranes, which is a risk factor in this case. Additionally, the CXR findings of patchy infiltrates and a right sided pleural effusion are consistent with this diagnosis.",2,,A,TRUE,,A,,

The abdominal lymph nodes can be broadly divided into pre-aortic and para-aortic groups, depending upon their relationship to the aorta.
The pre-aortic nodes lie anterior to the aorta and lie around the origins of the visceral (anterior) arteries. They drain the gastrointestinal tract and its accessory viscera (liver, spleen and pancreas). These nodes can be further divided into three groups, each lying near to the origins of their respective artery:
Coeliac lymph nodes
Superior mesenteric lymph nodes
Inferior mesenteric lymph nodes
  All of the efferent lymphatics from the pre-aortic nodes drain into the intestinal trunk, which in turn drains into the cisterna chlyi.

9771,231994,A 74-year-old lady has been getting worsening hip pain for many months. Her GP suspects it is due to osteoarthritis but requests an x-ray. The x-ray shows an abnormality in the right ilium. The bone appears expanded in parts and there are coarse trabeculations. What is the most likely diagnosis?,SBA: Musculoskeletal and Trauma,Paget disease,Osteoporosis,Osteogenesis imperfecta type IV,Osteogenesis imperfecta type II,Renal osteodystrophy,A,95%,1%,1%,0%,2%,"Explanation:
Paget disease
Paget disease is seldom found in patients below the age of 50 but is one of the more common musculoskeletal abnormalities thereafter. It consists of polyostotic, asymmetric disordered bone remodelling where intensive osteoclastic activity leads to multiple lytic lesions before osteoblastic activity results in the formation of sclerotic bone. A variety of imaging findings can be seen with x-ray.
Lytic phase: During the lytic phase, radiolucency with a ‘flame’ or ‘blade of grass’ shape extends along the diaphysis and osteoporosis circumscripta (large lucent areas of skull) can be found in the skull.
Mixed phase: lytic and sclerotic phenomena
Sclerotic phase: densely sclerotic bone such as the classical ‘ivory vertebra’ can be found.
Clinically it can be an incidental asymptomatic diagnosis or can present as all or any of:
Elevated ALP with a normal calcium and phosphate
A pathological fracture – although it may be sclerotic, the bone structure is disordered and therefore weaker than normal bone.
Cranial nerve palsies – due to compression at neural foramina
Enlarging head / hat size – due to widening of the diploic spaces (referred to as the Tam O’Shanter sign, whereby the skull takes on the appearance of a the Scottish hat called the Tam O’Shanter)
High output cardiac failure – this is a rare presentation caused by markedly increased bony perfusion
Pain – in the absence of a fracture, it is usually not a painful condition per se but can co-exist with other conditions such as osteoarthritis which may be the cause of the patient’s pain
Radiologically the hallmarks are bony expansion with coarsening of the trabeculae and cortices. On a bone scan active lesions will show increased uptake due to their increased blood flow.
Sarcomatous degeneration of the affected sites into either an osteosarcoma, malignant fibrous histiocytoma or chondrosarcoma carries a poor prognosis and careful study should be made of any known lesions at each imaging opportunity. New soft tissue component formation or new lysis of previously sclerotic bone should raise suspicion.
  Hyperparathyroidism
Parathyroid hormone acts to increase calcium levels either by promoting reabsorption in the kidneys or by acting on the osteoclasts of the bones and leads to increased bone resorption. This is seen as generalised osteopenia and cortical thinning, particularly of the subperiosteal bone.
Primary hyperparathyroidism is usually caused by an autonomous adenoma (alternatively parathyroid hyperplasia or a parathyroid carcinoma). Medullary nephrocalcinosis is most commonly caused by primary hyperparathyroidism but does also occur with secondary and tertiary hyperparathyroidism.
Secondary hyperparathyroidism is a hyperplastic response of the parathyroid glands to the high phosphate and low calcium levels which accompany renal osteodystrophy. Soft tissue calcification is very much a feature of renal osteodystrophy. Confusingly the high circulating levels of phosphate in renal osteodystrophy leads to dystrophic mineralisation of trabecular bone which is seen as sclerosis; hence renal osteodystrophy is a cause of generalised increase in bone density despite hyperparathyroidism being a cause of osteopenia.
Tertiary hyperparathyroidism occurs when a patient with secondary hyperparathyroidism (i.e. chronic overstimulation of the parathyroid glands) goes on to develop an autonomous adenoma.
  Osteoporosis
Loss of bone mass is called osteoporosis. It can result from a variety of mechanisms detailed in the table. Serum calcium, phosphate and ALP levels may all be normal in patients with osteoporosis. Loss of bone mass causes the bones to be susceptible to fractures resulting from everyday stress (insufficiency fractures) or as a result of minor trauma. The typical fractures would be a Colles fracture of the wrist or a fractured neck of femur.
Diagnosis is by DEXA (dual energy x-ray absorpitometry) whereby images are taken usually of the spine or femoral neck. By subtracting the two, the density of the bone can be calculated. Patients are scored by comparing their bone density to either age matched normal individuals (Z-score, said to be a more reliable figure) or to young adults (T-score). A T-score of less than -2.5 is considered diagnostic.
The ‘H’ sign or Honda sign is seen on nuclear medicine bone scans. It occurs when there is increased uptake in the sacrum as a result of insufficiency fractures and is often caused by underlying osteoporosis.

  Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI)
A defect on either chromosome 7 or 17 leads to abnormal type 1 collagen. Most cases are inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion. An adult with OI is most likely to have either type I or type IV. On imaging there is diffuse undermineralisation of the skeleton and (sometimes extreme) cortical thinning. Once a child with OP has become mobile the soft bones become bowed under the weight of the body. The pressure of the femoral heads on the soft acetabulae leads to acetabular protrusion. Basilar invagination results from pressure of the cervical spine on the base of the skull. Insufficiency fracture of the vertebral bodies lead to a biconcave appearance. OI is a differential diagnosis for multiple wormian bones which persist to adulthood.

12091,231994,A 43-year-old man presents with a unilateral Horner syndrome. You suspect he may have an internal carotid artery dissection. What is the best investigation to perform?,SBA: Central Nervous and Head & Neck,MRA carotid,Colour duplex ultrasound,Unenhanced CT head,CT angiography,No investigation needed,A,37%,4%,3%,54%,2%,"Explanation:
On T1w fat saturated images the dissection appears as a crescenteric high signal aka ‘the sickle sign’ or ‘the fried egg’. A slice transverse through the vessel shows hyperintensity in a crescenteric or circumferential shape to the wall of the affected vessel. Fat saturated T1 sequences may be the most sensitive sequence for cerebral artery dissections but similar findings can still be seen on T2. Unlike large vessel dissections the anatomy here is usually too small to see a dissection flap.
The other classic cause of a Horner syndrome might be an ipsilateral PCOM or PCA aneurysm.
On duplex ultrasound a dissection manifests as a thickened hypoechoic vessel wall with a low flow due to the stenotic effect of the dissection flap but in the acute setting ultrasound has largely been superseded by cross-sectional imaging and therefore these findings are more likely to be incidentally picked up in cases where dissection is not suspected.
The main feature of a dissection on a plain CT would be a crescenteric high attenuation rim representing the acute/subacute mural haematoma formed within the false lumen. The remaining true lumen may be narrowed compared to the contralateral side. With such a minimal question there is an argument to suggest that a plain CT to rule out a haemorrhagic stroke would be the most appropriate imaging however this would be an unusual presentation in an unusual age range for this eventuality.
CT angiography does have an excellent sensitivity and specificity in the diagnosis of craniocervical dissections although image interpretation can be hindered by streak artefact from the skull base. Usually in the DGH setting however this is the test that the patient would be most likely to undergo first. That does not, however, mean it is the best test, it is simply a matter of pragmatism that most hospitals would be able to arrange a CTA on a more emergent basis than an MRA.
MRA imaging is more useful in the diagnosis of carotid artery dissection than in vertebral artery dissection but is thought of as the modality of choice.
No investigation would only be pertinent if a mis-diagnosis of Bell palsy had been made.
Overall this is a tricky question. In the real world you could make a case for either CTA or MRA (in the absence of the option of DSA which would be the gold standard). On balance the current trend seems to be that MRA is the best answer to give.",FALSE,"CT angiography is the best investigation to perform in a patient with a unilateral Horner syndrome, as it can provide detailed images of the internal carotid artery to assess for a dissection.

The anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) is particularly vulnerable to clip injuries and pivot shift injuries. Secondary signs of an ACL tear include:
Anterior translation of the tibia to >5mm
Bowing of the posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) to <105o
So-called ‘uncovering’ of the lateral meniscus where there is posterior displacement of the posterior horn of the lateral meniscus by at least 3.5mm
Lateral compartment contusions (if pivot shift or clip injury mechanism)
Anterior contusions (if hyperextension mechanism)
Although the medial collateral ligament can also be ruptured during a pivot shift or clip type injury, it is not considered as a secondary sign of ACL rupture.
  Clip injury and pivot shift injury
These two injuries are very similar. Both involve valgus stress on a flexed knee (such as a tackle to the knee during sports). A pivot shift injury also requires external rotation of the tibia. The three main structures most at risk during these injuries are:
Anterior cruciate ligament (especially in a pivot shift injury)
Medial collateral ligament (especially in a clip injury)
Medial meniscus (remember that the medial meniscus is attached to the medial collateral ligament)
If all three are present together it is referred to as the O’Donoghue triad. Since O’Donoghue defined this triad however, it has been discovered that lateral meniscal tears are actually more common with this type of injury than medial meniscus ones.
Bony contusions occur at the side of impact because the proximal tibia and distal femur impact on one another thus:
Lateral tibial plateau (posterolateral in pivot shift injury)
Lateral femoral condyle",TRUE,"The correct answer is 5.

  Myocardial scar / Chronic infarct
This is a non-reperfusable myocardial defect (chronic infarct). It gives a wall motion abnormality but would demonstrate thinned myocardium. The T2 signal is low. Scars demonstrate abnormal Thallium perfusion but does not redistribute with delayed thallium, and does not take up FDG.

The quadrigeminal cistern sits behind the midbrain, just above the cerebellum. The ambient cisterns run around the posterolateral aspect of the midbrain on either side joining to the interpeduncular cistern and is essentially an extension of the quadrigeminal cistern.
  Image © Medical Exam Prep
  The posterior communicating artery (PCom) runs between the internal carotid artery and the posterior cerebral artery. The PComs sit anterior to the midbrain and blood from an aneurysm of the PCom will extend into the interpeduncular cistern, ambient cisterns and thereby to the quadrigeminal cistern.
The third cranial nerve runs parallel to the posterior communicating artery and dives under the posterior cerebral artery. The association between PCOM or PCA pathology and third nerve palsy signs is classical. If a patient has a painful ptosis, a PCOM aneurysm should be considered. It will be an ipsilateral pathology because the Oculomotor nerve is post-ganglionic at this point.

You have been asked to perform a barium meal to find the cause of the problem. The barium meal shows a mottled filling defect which does not appear to be attached to the gastric wall. What is the most likely explanation?,SBA: Gastrointestinal,Phytobezoar,Local recurrence,Bouveret syndrome,Mirizzi syndrome,Trichobezoar,A,74%,4%,5%,1%,17%,"Explanation:
Bezoar
The word bezoar comes from the Persian word for antidote (JK Rowling had a point), and quite apart from their usage in the fictional wizarding world of Harry Potter the term is used to describe concretions of ingested matter which have collected in the stomach or other part of the gastrointestinal tract.
A phytobezoar - this consists of undigested fibrous plant matter
A trichobezoar – this consists of ingested hair and occurs almost exclusively in women, 80% of whom are under the age of 30.
A number of conditions can predispose patients to developing a bezoar; chiefly those which impede passage through the stomach due to either the sheer quantity of ingested matter, the lack of gastric motility or an outright gastric outlet obstruction.
Underlying causes of a bezoar
Poor gastric motility (vagotomy, diabetes, connective tissue disorder)
Vagotomy
Diabetes
Connective tissue disorder
Myotonic dystrophy
Hypothyroidism
Insufficient mechanical or acid/protease action
Gastrectomy
Dental problems
Gastric outlet obstruction
Ulcers
Strictures
  On a fluoroscopic study the bezoar will appear as a large intraluminal filling defect which moves with patient positioning and does not appear to be fixed to the wall at any point. Often on CT the bezoar will be strikingly obvious as a large but smoothly rounded heterogenous mass within the stomach. Locules of gas within the mass are common.
  Bouveret syndrome
This is akin to a gallstone ileus where the level of obstruction is the proximal duodenum and there is consequential gastric outlet obstruction.
  Mirizzi syndrome
Obstruction of the common bile duct by extrinsic compression from a gallstone sitting within the cystic duct is called Mirizzi syndrome.
  Duplication cysts
Around quarter of duplication cysts occur in each of the ileum, oesophagus and colon (of these the ileum is the most common). The remaining quarter includes the stomach, jejunum and duodenum. A barium study may show a filling defect reminiscent of an extrinsic mass and if it is visible on ultrasound it would appear as a rounded or tubular cystic mass. For the most part however the diagnosis can be made on CT or MRI. The thin wall of the cyst may enhance slightly on CT and on MRI they will return high T2 signal, much as would be expected from a cystic structure.
  Stromal tumour also known as GIST (Gastrointestinal stromal tumour)
Particularly when of low staging at resection, these tumours carry an excellent prognosis. Unfortunately around half of patients present with metastatic disease owing to the relatively indolent nature of the primary lesion. Tumour histology is used to guide follow up and newer antibody therapies have also improved outcomes significantly.
70% of GISTs occur in the stomach with most of the remainder being found in the small bowel. Clinical presentation varies slightly with the exact location but dysphagia and early satiety are common, as are sequelae from mucosal ulceration and bleeding. They can occur as a feature of neurofibromatosis type 1 and are also discussed in connection to the Carney triad (Not to be confused with Carney syndrome). On imaging they may be occult or appear as a well-circumscribed submucosal mass. The low attenuation is attributable to central necrosis within the mass. Characteristically however they tend to enlarge extraluminally into the lesser sac, gastrosplenic or gastrohepatic ligaments. Of note, lymph node enlargement is specifically not a feature and an alternative diagnosis should be sought if lymph node enlargement is present.

What is the most likely explanation?,SBA: Central Nervous and Head & Neck,Nephrogenic systemic fibrosis,Sarcoid,Systemic lupus erythematous,Whipple disease,Extrinsic allergic alveolitis,A,54%,23%,17%,3%,3%,"Explanation:
On balance nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF) seems to fit best as the itchiness of the rash described fits better than it does for sarcoid. Dyspnoea has been described in NSF patients but is by no means a prominent feature though. The question writer has however, gone to the trouble of telling us that the patient has had an MRI scan which adds to the weight of evidence for NSF. This would render the brain lesion an incidental finding. On the other hand there is no suggestion that the patient has a poor renal function to predispose him or her to NSF (except possibly a post-iodiniated contrast nephropathy following the CT scan, despite the lack of clarity regarding time frames in this regard).
  NSF
Nephrogenic systemic fibrosis is a very nasty condition which develops a few weeks or months after a patient has received Gadolinium in patients with acute or chronic renal failure, in particular post liver or kidney transplant patients (NB. hepatorenal syndrome). No particular therapy for it has been found to be effective. Dyspnoea has been described in association with NSF in some literature.
  Sarcoidosis
Erythema nodosum is a well described manifestation of sarcoidosis but is usually described as tender erythematous nodules.
The thoracic manifestations of sarcoid are legion and shortness of breath could well be a symptom.
Neurosarcoid classically affects the cranial nerves but mass lesions can occur.
  SLE
The cutaneous manifestations of SLE are not usually itchy and the brain parenchyma is not often involved (with the exception of haemorrhage or abscess formation), although neuropsychiatric symptoms do occur.
  Whipple disease
Whipple disease causes malabsorption. Tropical sprue also causes malabsorption and is associated with dermatitis herpetiformis but otherwise is unrelated to the scenario described.

Rete testis ectasia
This is a relatively common finding in men around the age of 60. It is asymptomatic and therefore incidental. The rete testis is the name given to the tubules which collect spermatozoa from the seminiferous tubules and deliver them to the extra-testicular ducts. The normal rete testis is too small to appreciate with ultrasound but when, through age, the distal portion becomes stenosed, there is buildup of fluid within the rete testis. This is then seen as tubular branching anechoic structures within the testis.
  Spermatocoele
A spermatocoele is a focal dilatation of a duct within the head of the epididymis. Since they contain protein debris and spermatozoa, low level echoes can be seen floating within them differentiating them from epididymal cysts. They are essentially an incidental asymptotic finding. 
  Epididymal cyst
A cystic structure within the epididymis is most commonly a simple cyst. They can present as palpable masses or be found incidentally. On ultrasound they behave as you might expect from a cyst, with posterior acoustic enhancement of an anechoic round structure. The main differential diagnosis is a spermatocoele which, unlike a simple cyst, usually contains echogenic material. The latter is usually only found in the epididymal head. 
  Tunica albuginea cyst
The tunica albuginea is a fibrous layer covering the testicle. On ultrasound it appears as the thin echogenic line surrounding the testicle. When cysts form here they are usually palpable as small well-defined lumps a few millimetres in diameter. Appearances on ultrasound usually conform to those expected from any straightforward cyst i.e. An sharply defined anechoic structure with acoustic enhancement posteriorly. They can be uni or multilocular and although they can exert mass effect on the underlying testicle they do not affect the testicular tissue beyond this. They are most commonly located at the anterosuperior or superolateral aspect of the testicle.
  Intratesticular cyst
These are not readily palpable and therefore are seen only as incidental findings. They demonstrate the usual characteristics of any cyst on ultrasound but are located within the testicle itself. They are inconsequential but for their distinction from cystic teratomas. The latter will have solid enhancing components on an MRI scan. Provided, however, there is no ambiguity on ultrasound, no further follow up would be needed for a straightforward intratesticular cyst.
  Seminoma
Germ cell tumours are divided into seminomas and non-seminomatous varieties. They are very common and comprise almost half of all testicular tumours. They can often be found incidentally or subsequent to any trauma which might cause the patient to self-examine and discover a testicular lump. Alternatively they can present as a vague dull scrotal aching sensation with no lump.
Lymphatic drainage is to the retroperitoneum. Para-aortic lymph nodes are therefore regional. Involvement of the internal, external and common iliac nodes however, is considered non-regional. Only if there has been previous scrotal or inguinal surgery disrupting tissue planes are inguinal or external iliac artery nodes considered regional.
They typically are found in patients in their 40s. Testicular tumours can be diagnosed with a strong pre-test probability based solely on age as detailed in the table below. On ultrasound there will be an intratesticular low reflectivity well-defined mass. Colour doppler flow can be seen within the mass.

14265,231994,You are reviewing the CT scan of a 45-year-old man who previously underwent a splenectomy following a motorbike accident. His CT scan shows features consistent with splenosis.

Select ONE answer only.,SBA: Gastrointestinal,Multiple small soft tissue density nodules throughout the abdomen,Absent spleen,Retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy,Both retroperitoneal and mesenteric lymphadenopathy,Mesenteric lymphadenopathy,A,96%,2%,0%,1%,1%,"Explanation:
Splenosis
When there has been trauma to the spleen, tiny fragments can migrate around the peritoneal cavity, attach to structures and grow into larger collections of splenic tissue. On imaging these behave exactly as you would expect the normal spleen to for each modality. They can cause confusion if they are mistaken for peritoneal deposits.
  Labelled RBC scan
During this scan the patient is injected with stannous phosphate which enters the red blood cells and primes them for labelling with technetium. After 20 minutes, 20ml of blood is taken out and combined with Tc99m pertechnetate. The blood is then heated to around 50oC for 35mins and then re-injected. The red blood cells damaged by this process are filtered out of the circulation by any normally functioning splenic tissue within the body. Absence of uptake on imaging is consistent with asplenia.
An alternative scan which can also be performed is a Tc99m sulphur colloid scan.",TRUE,"I chose this answer because splenosis is a condition in which fragments of the spleen are found in other parts of the abdomen after a splenectomy.

14462,231994,The segmental branches of the renal artery divide to form which arteries? Select ONE answer only.,"SBA: Genito urinary, Adrenal, Obstetrics & Gynaecology and Breast",Interlobar arteries,Interlobular arteries,Peritubular network,Arcuate arteries,The vasa recta,A,69%,14%,1%,15%,1%,"Explanation:
The arterial supply to the kidneys is from the renal arteries, two fast flowing arteries that arise from the abdominal aorta at the L2 vertebral level. As the abdominal aorta is situated slightly to the left of the midline the right renal artery is longer than the left. The kidneys receive approximately 20% of the cardiac output.
After arising from the aorta, the right renal artery passes behind the inferior vena cava, the right renal vein, the head of the pancreas, and the second part of the duodenum as it travels to the kidney. The left renal artery passes behind the left renal vein, the body of the pancreas and the splenic vein as it travels to the kidney. The left renal artery is crossed anteriorly by the inferior mesenteric vein.
The renal arteries then enter the kidney at thehila of the kidneys, which lie approximately in the transpyloric plane at the L1 vertebral level. At the hila the renal arteries divide into four or five segmental branches.
Each segmental branch divides to form the interlobar arteries that are situated on either side of every renal pyramid. These interlobar arteries then undergo further division to form the arcuate arteries.
The interlobular arteries are then given off at right angles from the side of the arcuate arteries, and head into the cortical substance. Once within the cortex a final division takes place with the interlobular arteries dividing to form the efferent arterioles.
In the outer two-thirds of the cortex, the efferent arterioles form the peritubular network. The inner third of the cortex is supplied by long, straight arteries known as the vasa recta.

Select ONE answer only.,SBA: Cardiothoracic and vascular,The primary lung lesion is probably in the AP window,There is probably metastatic spread of the lung cancer to the right vocal cord,The lung lesion is probably a metastasis from a laryngeal cancer,The patient has lung cancer and laryngeal cancer,The lung cancer is most likely squamous cell in origin,A,59%,9%,16%,4%,12%,"Explanation:
Focal unilateral vocal cord uptake on a PET-CT scan is more likely to be due to the increased workload of the contralateral vocal cord muscles compensating for ipsilateral paralysis from involvement of the ipsilateral recurrent laryngeal nerve in the chest rather than metastatic infiltration of the contralateral vocal cord itself.
Vocal cord paralysis is a known sign of thoracic malignancy owing to innervation by the recurrent laryngeal nerve.
Left - passes through the aortopulmonary window, under the aorta 
Right - passes under the right subclavian artery
  Infiltration of one of these nerves would lead to a unilateral vocal cord palsy. Since the left has a longer thoracic course, it is at greater risk of involvement in a thoracic malignancy. Infiltration may be by the index mass itself, or by an involved lymph node distant from the primary mass.",FALSE,The PET-CT scan is confirming avidity in both the thoracic lesion and the right vocal cord.

Which of the following best explains these findings?,SBA: Central Nervous and Head & Neck,Lacunar infarcts,Perivascular space,Lyme disease,Neurocysticercosis,Cryptococcus,A,51%,40%,1%,2%,7%,"Explanation:
In day to day reporting would be second nature to diagnose these. Both VR spaces and lacunar infarctions could be described in this manner however the history of diabetes and hypertension shifts the balance more towards lacunar infarctions. Chronic infarctions do not restrict diffusion.
  Cryptococcus
This is an opportunistic yeast-like fungus which therefore requires a degree of immunocompromise, typically AIDS. The cryptococcomas are non-enhancing low density lesions in the basal ganglia. A granulomatous meningitis can also occur. They can be differentiated from VR spaces on FLAIR where VR spaces will suppress (being CSF in content) whereas the mucoid cryptococcomas will not.
  Neurocysticercosis
A CNS infection caused by a tapeworm native to low income countries and carried by pigs. Cysts calcify over time. The cysts are classically described as a ‘cyst with a dot’.

Select ONE answer only.,SBA: Musculoskeletal and Trauma,C5,C7,C4,T1,T2,A,81%,1%,17%,1%,0%,"Explanation:
In the cervical spine the nerve roots exit at the spinal cord without needing to traverse (as in the lumbar spine). The exiting nerve root takes the name of the vertebra BELOW the affected disc. A disc protrusion at C3/4 will affect the C4 nerve root. This allows for the extra nerve root at C8 before reaching the thoracic spine. In the thoracic spine the affected level takes its name from the vertebral body ABOVE that level.
In the lumbar spine the exiting nerve root is usually compressed in the neural foramen, whereas the traversing nerve root is compressed usually in the lateral recess. Far lateral bulges affect the exiting nerve root (takes its name from the vertebral body ABOVE that level). Paracentral bulges affect the traversing nerve root (takes its name from the vertebral body BELOW that level).

What is the most likely diagnosis?,SBA: Gastrointestinal,Pseudomyxoma peritonei,Cardiac failure,TB peritonitis,Ovarian cancer,Mesothelioma,A,89%,0%,1%,9%,1%,"Explanation:
Pseudomyxoma peritonei
Pseudomyxoma peritonei is the term used to denote the peritoneal cavity filled with mucinous fluid secondary to intraperitoneal rupture of a mucinous tumour. Most commonly the original tumour is an appendix mucocoele. Scalloping of the liver by loculated ascites is typical. It is more common in women than men and patients range in age from their 20s to 80s.",FALSE,"I chose this option because ovarian cancer is the most common cause of ascites and scalloping of the liver on a CT scan.

Actinomycosis
The bacterium actinomyces israelii produces proteases which allows it to cross structures which would otherwise present a barrier to spread of infection. Within the abdominal cavity actinomycosis leads to abscess formation, and fistula development. It is usual for the patient to have previously suffered a ruptured appendix or to be using an IUCD, or other similar entities. In the case of an IUCD, tuboovarian abscesses can form and spread locally to involve the psoas. Extrinsic ureteric compression leads to hydronephrosis.
  Tuberculosis
Abdominal tuberculosis most commonly affects the ileocaecal junction with thickening of the ileocaecal valve and narrowing of the terminal ileum. This can be seen on fluoroscopic examination as the Fleischner sign or umbrella sign where the gaping ileocaecal valve abuts the thin, strictured terminal ileum. Local lymph node enlargement with or without central low attenuation to the lymph nodes may be seen on CT. Multiple different lesions in multiple sites (i.e. skip lesions) is also a feature and a characteristic feature is of elevation of the margins of an ulcer which follow the orientation of lymphoid follicles. In the colon this means the margins are elevated in the transverse plane but in the terminal ileum they are longitudinal. 
The involvement of the ileocaecal valve and the presence of skip lesions means that a key differential diagnosis is Crohn disease. Over half of cases of abdominal tuberculosis will have concurrent ascites whereas this is a relatively rare feature for Crohn disease and can be used as a discriminator.
Specifically relating to the stomach, tuberculosis can cause pyloric stenosis, multiple deep ulcers on the lesser curve, and linitis plastic type narrowing of the antrum.",FALSE,"Complicated appendicitis is the most likely diagnosis because the patient has acute abdominal pain, is tender and pyrexial, has an elevated WCC/CRP, and imaging shows a right adnexal abscess that is tracking into the psoas and right sided hydronephrosis.

On USS there is a cystic mass with thick septa on the left. What is the most likely diagnosis?,SBA: Paediatrics,Torted malignant germ cell tumour,Malignant granulosa cell,Torted dermoid,Pelvic Inflammatory Disease,Ectopic pregnancy,A,52%,16%,10%,8%,14%,"Explanation:
Germ Cell tumour
Ovarian germ cell tumours include teratomas, yolk sac tumours, choriocarcinomas and mixed germ cell tumours. Ovarian embryonal carcinoma and dysgerminomas are also germ cell tumours. Approximately 95% of germ cell tumorus are benign teratomas and of the remaining 5% the most common ovarian malignant germ cell tumour is the dysgerminoma. Germ cell tumours make up approximately a quarter of all ovarian tumours and tend to affect young adults or children although can occur at any age. Besides pregnancy and gestational trophoblastic disease, βHCG can also be raised ovarian embryonal carcinoma and dysgerminoma. Embryonal carcinoma can also cause elevation of AFP levels although this would be more classically associated with a Leydig-Sertoli tumour. Embryonal carcinoma can cause menstrual irregularity and any torting ovarian tumour can lead to the acute presentation described. Thick septa as a finding in ovarian masses is strongly linked to malignancy of any nature.
  Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID)
This is a coverall term applied to ascending infection of the genital tract. It encompasses endometritis, salpingitis, hydrosalpinx, pyosalpinx, and tubo-ovarian abscesses. Chlamydia and gonorrhoea account of most of the cases and the disease is most prevalent in sexually active young people. Imaging features are those secondary to inflammation with increased vascularity to the endometrium and small volume ascites. Inflammation is also seen on MRI as avid enhancement post contrast. Pelvic inflammatory disease can be complicated by a condition called Fitz-Hugh-Curtis syndrome where there is perihepatitis secondary to PID. 
  Granulosa cell tumours
These oestrogen producing tumours can affect women of any age. The excess oestrogen causes irregular or post menopausal bleeding. They tend to be large and multicystic with thick septations and a sponge-like appearance. Importantly they can be differentiated from epithelial ovarian tumours (e.g. Mucinous cystanedomas) by their lack of a feature described as intracystic papillary projections.
  Dermoid
Teratomas and dermoid cysts have very similar imaging characteristics despite their histological differences. They are usually described interchangeably in literature. Mature teratomas are the most common ovarian neoplasm but are slow growing and usually benign. By contrast immature teratomas are malignant. The presence of fat is a strong indicator for a mature teratoma or a dermoid with the combination of fat, fluid and calcification being highly specific. On MRI the fat will show the usual signal drop-out on gradient echo sequences. Calcification is low in signal on T2. Although benign, dermoids can be complicated by torsion or rupture. Malignant degeneration if it does occur, is to squamous cell carcinoma most commonly.
  Ectopic pregnancy 
Vaginal bleeding is very common in early pregnancy but vaginal bleeding with pain or pain without vaginal bleeding definitely call for an ectopic pregnancy to be excluded. Factors which increase the risk of ectopic pregnancy include:
Previous ectopic 
IVF conception
Previous surgery to the Fallopian tubes
PID
Since most present around 7-8 weeks gestation it is usual that the woman will not yet have had the first routine ultrasound scan, or in many cases, may not yet be aware of the pregnancy at all. Serial serum βHCGs usually fail to double in the usual 48hours for ectopic pregnancies. The exact level of βHCG helps guide the sonographer as to what they can expect to find. An ectopic pregnancy is most commonly located within one or other Fallopian tube. Ultrasound will fail to show an intrauterine pregnancy and the ectopic pregnancy can often be seen as a cystic mass elsewhere. The classic ‘ring of fire’ sign refers to the peripheral colour Doppler flow seen on an ectopic pregnancy although this can also be seen on a normal corpus luteal cyst.",FALSE,"Ectopic pregnancy is the most likely diagnosis in this case because the patient is a 15-year-old girl with irregular periods, an acute fever and pain, and a raised βHCG level. Additionally, an ultrasound scan revealed the presence of a cystic mass with thick septa on the left, which is a common symptom of ectopic pregnancy.",2,,E,FALSE,,D,,

Select ONE answer only.,SBA: Paediatrics,Birt-Hogg-Dube syndrome,DRASH syndrome,WAGR syndrome,Perlman syndrome,Golabi-Behmel syndrome,A,67%,5%,3%,10%,14%,"Explanation:
Birt-Hogg-Dube syndrome is a very rare condition which predisposes to chromophobic RCCs. Patients also suffer from pulmonary cysts (increased risk of spontaneous pneumothorax) and fibrofolliculomas (benign fibrous tumours related to the hair follicles).
Predisposing syndromes for Wilms tumour
Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome - macroglossia, hemihypertrophy, visceromegaly, omphalocoele
DRASH syndrome - progressive glomerulonephritis and male pseudohermaphroditism
WAGR syndrome - Wilms tumour, aniridia, GU abnormalities, mental retardation
Perlman syndrome - polyhydramnios, macrocephaly, visceromegaly
Golabi-Behmel syndrome - macrostomia, macroglossia, occular hypertelorism
  Wilms tumour (nephroblastoma)
This is the most common abdominal mass in children under the age of 8. There are reasonably strong associations with renal anomalies, genital anomalies, aniridia and Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (although the last of these also has an association with neuroblastoma). Presentation is usually with an abdominal mass and/or pain.
On imaging the masses are usually heterogenous. Cystic areas can often be seen secondary to areas of necrosis. The claw sign occurs when there is a rim of normal renal tissue extending part of the way around the mass. A Wilms tumour is often described as enhancing but less so than the adjacent normal renal parenchyma.
  Renal cell carcinoma
After around the age of 11 the incidence of Wilms tumours and renal cell carcinomas are approximately equal. It can be extremely difficult, nigh on impossible, to tell the two apart on imaging characteristics alone. In general however, renal cell carcinomas are more likely to present with haematuria whereas Wilms tumours, being usually very large, are more likely to present as a large abdominal mass. Both can exhibit calcification, though this is more common in renal cell cancer, and both can invade the renal veins or IVC. Any child diagnosed with a renal cell carcinoma must be screened for von Hippel Lindau syndrome.",TRUE,"I chose number 2, Birt-Hogg-Dube syndrome, because it does not predispose to Wilms tumour.

An Captopril 99mTc-MAG3  scan showed a delayed time to peak activity on the left side. The ultrasound shows the left kidney to be smaller than the right and on Doppler insonation the arterial peak velocity reading is higher than normal. What is the most likely diagnosis?,"SBA: Genito urinary, Adrenal, Obstetrics & Gynaecology and Breast",Unilateral renal artery stenosis,Fibromuscular dysplasia,Buerger disease,Retroperitoneal fibrosis,Polyarteritis nodosa,A,95%,2%,1%,1%,1%,"Explanation:
Renovascular hypertension
This term is used to denote high blood pressure caused by renal artery stenosis or other renal vascular pathology. It is an important entity which affects around 5% of hypertensives and should be suspected in particularly young patients, those whose hypertension suddenly worsens or in patients who experience a drop in renal function following commencement of an ACE inhibitor.
  Tc99m-MAG3, I131-OIH or Tc99m- DTPA can all be used to show differential activity of the kidneys. This test combined with the use of an ACE inhibitor such as enalapril or captopril can facilitate the diagnosis of renovascular hypertension, including unilateral renal artery stenosis although is less sensitive for cases of bilateral renal artery stenosis. Initially the affected kidney will have a slower time to peak activity than the normal counterpart. On administration of an ACE inhibitor the affected side will show a marked lengthening of the time to peak activity as well as an increase in the transit time (seen as a slow downslope of activity following the peak). This arises since the normal effect of the ACE inhibitor on the unaffected size causes retention of tracer and preservation of activity within the kidney whereas the affected side experiences slow transit of the tracer through the kidney.
  Renin-Angiotensin System
Renin is released by the kidneys in response to low renal perfusion levels. It converts angiotensinogen to Angiotensin I which is then converted to angiotensin II by the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). Angiotensin II is a vasoconstrictor which acts on, among other things, the kidneys causing water retention but at the expense of blood pressure. Thus ACE inhibitors, used extensively to manage high blood pressure, work by preventing renal arteriole vasoconstriction. In patients with renovascular hypertension the renal perfusion pressure is low, not because of an absence of water but because the arterial flow is compromised. Thus the usual mechanism of the renin-angiotensin system serves only to exacerbate the problem by increasing blood pressure further and adding more strain to an already strained system.

  Renal artery stenosis
There are three main aetiologies of renal artery stenosis. The most prevalent is atherosclerosis. Fibromuscular dysplasia is the second most common and is classically given as affecting a relatively young woman with beading (string of beads) of the mid and distal renal arteries seen, for which the management is angioplasty. Finally a small number of cases are secondary to a variety of conditions such as Buerger’s disease, Takayasu’s disease and neurofibromatosis.
The significance of diagnosis of atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis is in avoiding the use of ACE inhibitors. The ASTRAL trial showed that there was no long term benefit of stenting the stenoses over best medical management, although there was still a reduction in the number of episodes of flash pulmonary oedema experienced by the patients.
Slightly different numbers are given in the different sources.

The question refers to Bells palsy.
The seventh cranial nerve undergoes a number of turns as it crosses through the temporal bone.
The pontine (or Cisternal) segment runs from the pons to the internal auditory meatus. This can enhance Bell palsy.
The Labyrinthine (or meatal) segment runs from the internal auditory meatus to the geniculate ganglion and enhancement is most typically associated with Bells palsy.
The Tympanic portion runs horizontally from the geniculate ganglion. It is also seen to enhance with Bells palsy but since it is known to enhance normally too this is not a distinguishing feature.
The mastoid portion runs vertically (and gives off the nerve to stapedius). It can also enhance normally.
The parotid portion runs distally from the stylomastoid foramen and lies lateral to the retromandibular vein.",FALSE,"The geniculate ganglion is the most likely part of the facial nerve to be affected in this case because it is the most proximal segment of the facial nerve.

Practices vary locally however the usual quoted time frame is 4.5 hours following onset of symptoms. 8 hours is much beyond this.
A normal CT head is often the case for patients who are thrombolysed. There is a time lag before infarcted tissue becomes radiologically apparent. Loss of the insular ribbon sign refers to loss of grey-white matter differentiation at the insular cortex and is often seen with MCA territory infarctions. It forms part of the assessment of the ASPECTS score whereby 10 specific parts of the MCA territory are reviewed. Patients with more than two of these areas involved who are thrombolysed have been shown to have poorer outcomes than those not thrombolysed so whilst insular ribbon involvement on its own is not a contraindication it can contribute to the overall picture.",FALSE,"The normal CT head is a contraindication to thrombolysis with alteplase because it suggests that the patient does not have a clot causing the symptoms.

What is the most likely explanation? Select ONE answer only.,SBA: Paediatrics,Congenital adrenal hyperplasia,Mullerian duct anomalies,Turner syndrome,Kleinfelter syndrome,Beckwith-Wiedemann Syndrome,A,49%,13%,24%,11%,3%,"Explanation:
Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH)
Normal-appearing adrenal glands does not exclude a diagnosis of CAH however usually the classical appearance for the adrenal glands in a case of CAH is of diffuse enlargement with a so-called 'wrinkled' morphology. The word 'cerebriform' is often used to describe them and compares their appearance to that of the brain. The usual hypoechoic cortex and hyperechoic medulla is still seen but the enlarged gland is folded upon itself giving the wrinkled appearance. The role of ultrasound is also to discern any normal male or female anatomy. The normal uterus can usually be identified, if present, but the ovaries may simply be too small at birth to appreciate. In contrast, the normal testes, where present, should be visible with ultrasound from birth. Females usually present with ambiguous genitalia whereas males can present later with severe electrolyte imbalances.
  Mullerian duct anomalies (MDA)
The two Mullerian ducts form separately then fuse in the first trimester to form all the structures between the upper vagina and the fallopian tubes. The final part of the amalgamation of the two sides is resorption of the central uterine septum.
  Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome also known as EMG syndrome (Exomphalos, Macroglossia, Gigantism)
This curious condition crops up in a number of different radiology circles. It is caused by a mutation on chromosome 11 and leads to a specific set of clinical manifestations, chief among them are the three which give it the alternative name of EMG syndrome. Malrotation of the small intestine is another feature which has a high concordance with this condition.",FALSE,Mullerian duct anomalies are the most likely explanation for an ultrasound scan of a 3-day-old baby with ambiguous genitalia that shows a normal uterus but no ovaries.

The correct access should of course be determined on a case by case basis and will take into account various facets such as the patient body habitus, any previous access used and the disease site.
The retrograde approach is easier to perform, and patients usually go on to have a lower rate of post-procedure complications.
Antegrade – straight down the ipsilateral side
Retrograde – contralateral groin, up and over the aortic bifurcation
+ Avoids crossover
- Crossover required
- Harder in patients with a high BMI
+ More suited to patients with a high BMI
- Less operator maneuverability
+ Greater operator maneuverability
- Harder to perform
+ Easier to perform
  The common femoral artery (CFA) is usually the best candidate since it is large and easy to find as it courses over the femoral head. Its proximity to the femoral head facilitates effective compression post-procedure minimizing the risk of complications.
Here use of the CFA is contraindicated (or not given as an option!) the superficial femoral artery (SFA) is the next best option. Owing to its superficial nature it can be an easier target in obese patients. The popliteal artery is a continuation of the SFA so clearly antegrade access via the profunda femoris artery is nonsensical.
Direct popliteal artery access is performed during SFA angioplasty when conventional approaches are not feasible however would be an unusual approach for this case.",FALSE,"I chose this option because it is the safest and least invasive method of accessing the popliteal artery. It is important to minimize the risk of complications in this patient due to their age and obesity. By accessing the artery via the superficial femoral artery, the risk of vascular injury is minimized, as the artery is located more superficially and is easier to access.

The left coronary artery arises from the aorta above the left cusp of the aortic valve. It supplies the left atrium, left ventricle, intraventricular septum and part of the left branch bundle of His. It is larger than the right coronary artery.
It passes between the left side of the pulmonary trunk and the left auricle and then birfucates into the left anterior descending artery (LAD), which is also called the anterior interventricular branch, and the left circumflex artery (LCA). Sometimes an additional artery arises at the bifurcation called the ramus or intermediate artery.
The LAD follows the anterior interventricular groove towards the apex of the heart and then continues to the posterior surface of the heart to anastamose with the posterior interventricular branch.
The LCA follows the anterior interventricular groove to the left border of the heart and then proceeds to the posterior surface. It then gives rise to the left marginal branch, which follows the left border of the heart.
The right coronary artery arises above the right cusp of the aortic valve. It supplies the right atrium, the SA and AV nodes and the posterior part of the interventricular septum.
It runs along the right atrioventricular groove before branching. The right marginal artery arises first and then the right coronary artery continues on to the posterior surface of the heart, still running in the right atrioventricular groove.

14533,231994,You are reviewing the images of a patient with sacroiliitis known to have an inflammatory arthritis. Which of the following diagnoses is correctly associated with its usual pattern of sacroiliitis? Select ONE answer only.,SBA: Musculoskeletal and Trauma,Bilateral asymmetrical sacroiliitis in psoriatic arthropathy,Bilateral symmetrical sacroiliitis in infective arthropathy,Bilateral asymmetrical sacroiliitis in enteropathic arthropathy,Bilateral symmetrical sacroiliitis in chronic reactive arthritis,Bilateral asymmetrical sacroiliitis in ankylosing spondylitis,A,69%,5%,10%,8%,7%,"Explanation:
Sacroiliitis in psoriatic arthropathy can be bilateral symmetrical or bilateral asymmetrical though the latter is more common.
  Psoriatic arthropathy
Around a fifth of patients with psoriasis develop arthropathy and it is also possible to suffer from psoriatic arthropathy in the absence of the typical psoriatic cutaneous plaques. Around 80% of patients are HLA-B27 positive.
Importantly, on x-ray there are findings of both erosive changes in addition to productive changes with periosteal new bone formation. The combination of the two contrives to leave a ‘pencil-in-cup’ appearance. The joints can appear fluffy due to the exuberance of new bone formation.
The differential diagnosis for periosteal reactions in the presence of an arthropathy is relatively narrow and very specific:
Psoriatic arthropathy
Juvenile rheumatoid arthritis
Reiter syndrome
Infective arthropathy
  Although often classified as a distal arthropathy, preferring the DIPs to the MCPs, psoriatic arthropathy does also affect the spine and SI joints frequently. ‘Sausage digits’ is a term used to describe the diffuse soft tissue swelling which can affect the fingers and toes. Osteoporosis does occur but is a feature of later disease.
  Seronegative arthritides - These are negative for Rheumatoid factor but have a strong association with HLA-B27 positivity.
Ankylosing spondylitis - 95%
Enteropathic arthropathy - 90%
Psoriatic arthritis - 80%
Chronic reactive arthritis - 70%
  Ankylosing spondylitis
This disease usually presents in early adulthood with gradual onset of back pain. There is a male preponderance, though it can affect women too. The vast majority (>90%) of patients are HLA-B27 positive. Radiologically the late features are classical with:
Bilateral symmetrical sacroiliitis
Enthesopathy - calcified tendon insertion sites
Bamboo spine - vertebral syndesmophytes, particularly in the thoracolumbar spine
Dagger sign - spinous process fusion
Erosion, then fusion at the symphysis pubis, costochondral, costovertebral and sternoclavicular joints
Thoracic manifestations: upper lobe pulmonary fibrosis, pericarditis, aortic root dilatation
  Early features are far more subtle and require a higher index of suspicion.
Enthesopathy - high signal on MRI at tendon insertion sites
Romanus lesions - triangular shaped oedema at the corners of vertebral bodies
Andersson lesions - bony oedema in the vertebral bodies adjacent to the disks.
Oedema in the sacroiliac joints.
  Patients with advanced ankylosing spondylitis are at increased risk of pathological fractures due to fusion. These can be pelvic fractures following a simple fall, or chance fractures of the spine (involving all three columns - in ankylosing spondylitis, these fractures are also sometimes termed chalk-stick or carrot fractures).
  Chronic reactive arthritis
This disease is said to present as a triad of arthritis, conjunctivitis/uveitis and urethritis/cervicitis (Can't see, can't pee, can't climb a tree) however in reality only around a third of patients present with all three symptoms. Patients are usually aged 16-60 years. It has a reasonably strong male predominance but does occur in women. It can occur following infection with chlamydia, but also with gastrointestinal infections such as salmonella, shigella, campylobacter and yersinia. Most (>2/3rds) of patients are HLA-B27 positive.
Bilateral asymmetrical sacroiliitis
Paravertebral ossification - similar to syndesmophytes but in theory are seen separately from the disc, bridging around it. Most commonly in the thoracolumbar spine.
Enthesopathy - particularly at achilles tendon insertion, interspinous ligaments, and pelvic ligaments.
  Enteropathic arthropathy
This occurs in a subsect of patients with inflammatory or infective bowel disease. Roughly 10-20% of patients with Crohn’s or ulcerative colitis suffer from enteropathic arthropathy. Like chronic reactive arthropathy, it can also occur in the context of salmonella, shigella and yersinia infections. Appearances are very similar to those of ankylosing spondylitis; the two can be very difficult to separate radiologically.
Bilateral symmetrical sacroillitis
Enthesopathy
Vertebral syndesmophytes
Fusion of spinous processes
  Juvenile idiopathic arthritis
This condition used to be termed juvenile rheumatoid arthritis. It is a cluster of similar conditions affecting patients under the age of 16.
The affected joints show:
Effusions
Erosions
Cartilage destruction
  Epiphyseal overgrowth secondary to reactive hyperaemia occurs owing to the immature nature of the skeleton. Premature physeal closure can result in limb length discrepancies in adulthood.
Large joints are typically affected first and the small joints of the hands and feet are affected later on.

Acute idiopathic scrotal wall oedema syndrome
This occurs mostly in children under the age of 10 but can occur in adults too and is an important differential diagnosis for acute scrotal pain. It is thought to be a kind of localised hypersensitivity reaction. Scrotal swelling is typical but accompanying pain may or may not be present. Features are usually fairly typical on ultrasound with unilateral scrotal wall oedema (can be bilateral in 10%) and hypervascularity.

Select ONE answer only.",SBA: Gastrointestinal,Adjacent lymph node enlargement,Location in the stomach,Exophytic component,Central necrosis,Neurofibromatosis type 1,A,76%,3%,5%,5%,11%,"Explanation:
Please note that the question asks which feature is LEAST consistent with the diagnosis.
Stromal tumour also known as GIST (Gastrointestinal stromal tumour)
Particularly when of low staging at resection, these tumours carry an excellent prognosis. Unfortunately around half of patients present with metastatic disease owing to the relatively indolent nature of the primary lesion. Tumour histology is used to guide follow up and newer antibody therapies have also improved outcomes significantly.
70% of GISTs occur in the stomach with most of the remainder being found in the small bowel. Clinical presentation varies slightly with the exact location but dysphagia and early satiety are common, as are sequelae from mucosal ulceration and bleeding. They can occur as a feature of neurofibromatosis type 1 and are also discussed in connection to the Carney triad (Not to be confused with Carney syndrome). On imaging they may be occult or appear as a well-circumscribed submucosal mass. The low attenuation is attributable to central necrosis within the mass. Characteristically however they tend to enlarge extraluminally into the lesser sac, gastrosplenic or gastrohepatic ligaments. Of note, lymph node enlargement is specifically not a feature and an alternative diagnosis should be sought if lymph node enlargement is present.

What is the most likely diagnosis?,SBA: Cardiothoracic and vascular,Atrial myxoma,Atrial thrombus,Cardiac sarcoma,Cardiac metastasis,Papillary fibroelastoma,A,82%,3%,1%,1%,14%,"Explanation:
Atrial myxoma
These are the most common benign neoplasms of the heart. Although usually sporadic, they can occur as part of Carney syndrome (atrial myxoma, facial/buccal pigmentation, sertoli tumours of the testis and multiple other findings. Not to be confused with Carney triad - pulmonary chondromas, gastric leiomyosarcomas and extra-adrenal paragangliomas). The finding of a small mass attached to the interatrial septum by a stalk is classical. Their mobility allows some to prolapse through the relevant atrioventricular valve during the cardiac cycle. They can act as a focus for platelet aggregation leading to systemic emboli for the more common left sided masses or pulmonary emboli for right sided myxomas. Iso or hypointentisty on T1w MRI is typical.
  Carney Triad
Carney syndrome
Pulmonary chondromas
Atrial myxoma
Gastric leiomyosarcoma (GIST)
Facial/buccal pigmentation
Extra-adrenal paraganglioma
Sertoli tumour of the testis
  Pituitary adenoma
  Papillary fibroelastoma
These tumours are rare even for cardiac tumours but yet are the most common cardiac tumour to be associated with the valves. Rather counter-intuitively, they do not cause valvular dysfunction. They are, like myxomas, relatively mobile, attached by a stalk, and able to prolapse through a valve but where myxomas usually arise from the interatrial septum, papillary fibroelastomas grow from the valve itself. Histopathologically they are gelatinous tumours resembling sea anemones with multiple papillary projections. They can act as a focus for platelet aggregation leading to systemic emboli for left sided masses or pulmonary emboli for right sided masses.
  Cardiac sarcoma
There are many different types of cardiac sarcoma. Cardiac sarcomas are the most common cause of primary malignant cardiac tumours. Their presentation usually relates either to embolic phenomena such as TIAs or symptoms from invasion such as pericardial effusion. In contrast to myxomas or fibroelastomas, malignant lesions tend to have a broad attachment to the heart wall. Another useful differentiating feature on imaging is the involvement of more than one chamber of the heart.
  Cardiac metastases
Metastases are significantly more common than cardiac sarcomas meaning metastases are the most common malignant cardiac tumours. In contrast to myxomas or fibroelastomas, malignant lesions tend to have a broad attachment to the heart wall. Tumours can be from lung or breast cancer, lymphoma, leukaemia and malignant melanoma.
  Atrial thrombus
The usual site for an atrial thrombus would be the left atrial appendage. Thrombi are not seen as mobile masses but as irregular lobulated masses. They can have a laminated appearance and the classical feature is low signal on gradient-echo MRI sequences owing to the presence of haemosiderin (blooming artefact). Ventricular thrombi can form too, it is usually a sequela of a previous myocardial infarction which has healed leaving a hypomobile portion of the ventricular wall. Adjacent to that part of wall there is relative stasis sufficient to facilitate thrombus formation.",TRUE,"Atrial myxoma is the most likely diagnosis because it is the most common primary cardiac tumor. It is usually located in the left atrium, attached to the septum by a stalk, and is hypointense to the myocardium on T1 MRI.

This question is contraversial given modern day NHS practices. Assuming that the question is driving at malignant melanoma metastases (dense lesions without haemorrhage), none of the other answers would be relevant however in usual practice this kind of patient would almost certainly get a CT CAP at the very least. However, we have to ask what the potential diagnosis is meant to be behind each of the proffered answers. A CXR or a CT chest and liver would be for the investigation of lung cancer, some of which can cause haemorrhagic metastases. A Renal ultrasound would be the investigation for a potential RCC, also potentially causing haemorrhagic metastases. Colonoscopy would be for investigation of suspected colon cancer. Mucinous adenocarcinoma of the colon can cause calcified metastases and the question is irritatingly ambiguous in this regard but on balance the description fits better with dense metastases from malignant melanoma rather than calcified metastases.",FALSE,"The next most appropriate investigation in this case would be a CXR (Chest X-Ray).

Select ONE answer only.,SBA: Musculoskeletal and Trauma,The proximal portion has the most abundant blood supply,It articulates with the radius,It is palpable at the base of the thenar eminence,It receives its blood supply from the radial artery,It is the largest bone in the proximal carpal row,A,83%,2%,5%,5%,5%,"Explanation:
  Please note that the question asks for the answer which is FALSE.
    The scaphoid bone is one of the carpal bones of the wrist. It is situated between the hand and forearm on the radial side of the wrist. It is the largest bone of the proximal row of wrist bones. It can be felt at the base of the thenar eminence and also within the anatomical snuffbox.
Within the anatomical snuffbox the scaphoid bone and the radius articulate to form part of the wrist joint. Tenderness in the anatomical snuffbox following a fall onto an outstretched hand should lead to suspicion of a scaphoid fracture.
Its blood supply is primarily supplied by the lateral and distal branches of the radial artery. There is a good blood supply to the middle and distal parts of the bone but the proximal portion is neglected and relies on ‘retrograde’ flow. A fracture of the scaphoid bone can disrupt the blood supply to the proximal portion. Failure to revascularise the scaphoid can result in avascular necrosis and arthritis.

Post-partum MR scanning shows a central area of high signal intensity on T2-weighted pre-contrast sequences, intense enhancement with IV gadolinium on T1-weighted at 25 seconds post- injection and isodensity with normal liver on T1-weighted at 75 seconds after IV gadolinium. What is the most likely diagnosis?",SBA: Gastrointestinal,focal nodular hyperplasia,adenoma,haemangioma,hepatocellular carcinoma,metastatic colonic carcinoma,A,0%,0%,0%,0%,0%,,FALSE,"I chose 2 because a haemangioma is the most likely diagnosis based on the imaging findings described. Haemangiomas are benign liver tumors that typically appear as focal hyperechoic lesions on ultrasound and show intense enhancement with IV gadolinium on T1-weighted images at 25 seconds post-injection and isodensity with normal liver on T1-weighted images at 75 seconds after IV gadolinium. Adenomas, hepatocellular carcinomas, focal nodular hyperplasias, and metastatic colonic carcinomas typically have different imaging findings on MRI that would not match the findings described in this case.",2,,C,FALSE,"I chose option 2, haemangioma, because the findings on the antenatal ultrasound and post-partum MR imaging are consistent with the typical characteristics of a hepatic haemangioma. 

The focal hyperechoic lesion on ultrasound is a common appearance of haemangiomas, which are benign vascular liver lesions. The post-partum MR findings further support this diagnosis: the central area of high signal intensity on T2-weighted pre-contrast sequences is consistent with the blood-filled spaces within the haemangioma. The intense enhancement with IV gadolinium on T1-weighted at 25 seconds post-injection indicates rapid contrast uptake by the lesion, which is also typical for haemangiomas due to their vascular nature. Finally, the isodensity with normal liver on T1-weighted at 75 seconds after IV gadolinium suggests that the lesion is not malignant, as malignant tumors usually retain contrast and appear hyperintense compared to normal liver tissue.

The other options are less likely based on the imaging findings and clinical context:

1. Adenoma: Hepatic adenomas are benign liver tumors often associated with oral contraceptive use or pregnancy. However, they usually have different imaging characteristics, such as heterogeneous enhancement and variable signal intensity on T2-weighted images.

3. Hepatocellular carcinoma: This is a malignant liver tumor, which is less likely in a young patient with no known risk factors (negative hepatitis serology and normal liver function tests). The imaging findings are also not consistent with hepatocellular carcinoma, which typically shows arterial enhancement and washout on delayed phases.

4. Focal nodular hyperplasia: This benign liver lesion can have similar imaging findings to haemangiomas, but the enhancement pattern is typically different, with a central scar and radiating fibrous septa.

5. Metastatic colonic carcinoma: This is unlikely given the patient's age and lack of any mentioned gastrointestinal symptoms or history. The imaging findings are also not typical for metastatic disease.",C,,
5,0,"A 40 year old man presents with bright red rectal bleeding, hypotension and tachycardia. He is initially resuscitated. The colonoscopist is unable to negotiate the sigmoid colon and active bleeding is seen from proximal bowel. Endoscopy to the third part of the duodenum is normal. A 99mTc RBC scan demonstrates accumulation across the upper abdomen, interpreted to be the proximal transverse colon.  An angiogram is performed. Which vessel should be catheterised to maximise the chance of demonstrating the bleeding point and what would be the most likely cause of this?",SBA: Cardiothoracic and vascular,coeliac axis and villous adenoma,coeliac axis and angiodysplasia,superior mesenteric artery and villous adenoma,superior mesenteric artery and angiodysplasia,inferior mesenteric artery and villous adenoma,D,0%,0%,0%,0%,0%,,TRUE,"The superior mesenteric artery is the main arterial supply to the transverse colon, which is where the bleeding is seen on the 99mTc RBC scan. Angiodysplasia is the most likely cause of this bleeding, as it is the most common cause of lower gastrointestinal bleeding in adults. Angiodysplasia is a type of vascular malformation involving the small arteries and veins of the gastrointestinal tract, and is most commonly found in the cecum and ascending colon. Catheterisation of the superior mesenteric artery will maximise the chance of demonstrating the bleeding point and the angiodysplasia.",1,,D,TRUE,"I chose option 4, ""superior mesenteric artery and angiodysplasia,"" for the following reasons:

1. Localization: The 99mTc RBC scan demonstrated accumulation across the upper abdomen, which was interpreted to be the proximal transverse colon. The proximal transverse colon is supplied by the superior mesenteric artery (SMA). Therefore, catheterizing the SMA would maximize the chance of demonstrating the bleeding point.

2. Most likely cause: Angiodysplasia is a common cause of lower gastrointestinal bleeding, particularly in older patients. It is characterized by abnormal, dilated blood vessels in the mucosal and submucosal layers of the gastrointestinal tract. Given the patient's age and presentation with bright red rectal bleeding, angiodysplasia is a more likely cause than a villous adenoma. Villous adenomas are benign tumors that can cause bleeding, but they are less common and typically present with occult bleeding rather than bright red blood.",D,,
6,0,"A 72 year old man, with a past history of coronary bypass surgery and transient ischaemic attack, comes to the clinic with a nine month history of weight loss and unwillingness to eat due to abdominal pain associated with meals. Investigation shows an iron deficiency anaemia and reduced serum albumin. What is most likely to be found on abdominal imaging?",SBA: Gastrointestinal,caecal pole mass on double contrast barium enema,multiple polyps on small bowel enema,severe atheromatous disease of the aorta with small bowel wall thickening on abdominal CT,cavernous transformation of the portal vein on superior mesenteric angiography,increased uptake in the region of the terminal ileum on labelled white cell scan,C,0%,0%,0%,0%,0%,,TRUE,"I chose this answer because it is the most likely scenario given the patient's medical history and symptoms. The patient has a history of coronary bypass surgery and transient ischaemic attack, both of which are risk factors for atherosclerosis, a condition in which fatty deposits build up in the walls of arteries. This can cause narrowing of the arteries and lead to a decrease in blood flow, which can cause the small bowel wall to thicken. An abdominal CT scan can detect this thickening, as well as any severe atheromatous disease of the aorta.",3,,C,TRUE,"I chose option 3 because the patient's history and symptoms point towards the possibility of chronic mesenteric ischemia. The patient has a history of coronary bypass surgery and transient ischemic attack, which indicates a history of vascular disease. The symptoms of weight loss, unwillingness to eat, and abdominal pain associated with meals are also suggestive of mesenteric ischemia, as the pain could be caused by insufficient blood flow to the intestines during digestion.

Abdominal CT showing severe atheromatous disease of the aorta with small bowel wall thickening would be consistent with this diagnosis, as the atheromatous plaques can cause narrowing of the mesenteric arteries, leading to reduced blood flow and ischemia. The other options do not fit as well with the patient's history and symptoms.",C,,
7,0,A 50 year old woman develops a non-tender nodule within the left submandibular gland. Ultrasound reveals a hypoechoic mildly lobulated lesion 1 cm in diameter. What is the least likely diagnosis?,SBA: Central Nervous and Head & Neck,Warthin's tumour,adenoid cystic tumour,intraglandular lymph node,pleomorphic adenoma,post-inflammatory sialectatic cavity,C,0%,0%,0%,0%,0%,,FALSE,Post-inflammatory sialectatic cavity is the least likely diagnosis because it is not usually associated with nodules in the submandibular gland. The other four diagnoses are all typically associated with nodules in the submandibular gland. The ultrasound findings of a hypoechoic mildly lobulated lesion 1 cm in diameter are more suggestive of one of the other four diagnoses.,2,,E,TRUE,"I chose option 3, intraglandular lymph node, as the least likely diagnosis for the following reasons:

1. Warthin's tumor: This is a benign salivary gland tumor that commonly occurs in the parotid gland, but it can also occur in the submandibular gland. It usually presents as a painless, slow-growing mass and can appear as a hypoechoic lesion on ultrasound.

2. Adenoid cystic tumor: This is a malignant tumor that can arise in the salivary glands, including the submandibular gland. It typically presents as a slow-growing, painless mass and can appear as a hypoechoic lesion on ultrasound.

4. Pleomorphic adenoma: This is the most common benign salivary gland tumor and can occur in the submandibular gland. It usually presents as a painless, slow-growing mass and can appear as a hypoechoic lesion on ultrasound.

5. Post-inflammatory sialectatic cavity: This can develop as a result of chronic inflammation or infection in the salivary gland, leading to the formation of a cystic cavity. This can appear as a hypoechoic lesion on ultrasound.

Given the ultrasound findings and clinical presentation, all of the above options are more likely than an intraglandular lymph node, which would typically appear as a more well-defined, oval or round hypoechoic structure on ultrasound. Additionally, intraglandular lymph nodes are less likely to present as a solitary nodule within the submandibular gland.",C,,

It is located between the two anterior cerebral arteries, and it is the main arterial connection between the two hemispheres of the brain. The anterior choroidal artery, basilar artery, middle cerebral artery, and pericallosal artery are less common sites for aneurysms.",2,,A,TRUE,"I chose the anterior communicating artery as the most likely site for the responsible aneurysm because the patient's presentation and imaging findings are consistent with a subarachnoid hemorrhage, which is commonly caused by a ruptured cerebral aneurysm. 

The anterior communicating artery is part of the Circle of Willis, which is a network of arteries that supplies blood to the brain. Aneurysms in the anterior communicating artery are the most common type of cerebral aneurysms, accounting for approximately 30-35% of all cerebral aneurysms. 

The patient's symptoms of sudden onset occipital headache and the imaging findings of hydrocephalus, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and frontal lobe hematoma suggest that an aneurysm in the anterior communicating artery has ruptured and caused bleeding into the subarachnoid space. This bleeding can cause increased intracranial pressure, leading to hydrocephalus, and can also result in a hematoma in the frontal lobe. 

The other options (anterior choroidal artery, basilar artery, middle cerebral artery, and pericallosal artery) are less likely to be the site of the responsible aneurysm, as they are not as commonly associated with subarachnoid hemorrhage and the described clinical presentation.",A,,
9,0,"A 40 year old Caucasian labourer presents with altered consciousness. A non-enhanced CT scan reveals a small high attenuation intra-axial lesion with considerable surrounding low attenuation in the adjacent white matter.

On T1-weighted MRI, meningiomas typically return high signal with surrounding low signal intensity, which is consistent with the patient's imaging findings. Other diagnoses, such as lymphoma, melanoma metastasis, intracranial lipoma, and non-small cell lung cancer metastasis, are less likely in this case.",2,,B,TRUE,"I chose option 3, melanoma metastasis, as the most likely diagnosis based on the given information. The patient presents with altered consciousness, and the CT scan reveals a high attenuation intra-axial lesion with surrounding low attenuation in the adjacent white matter. This pattern is suggestive of a hemorrhagic lesion, which is more commonly seen in melanoma metastasis.

Additionally, the MRI findings of high signal intensity on T1-weighted imaging further support the diagnosis of melanoma metastasis, as melanoma is known to have high signal intensity on T1-weighted images due to the presence of melanin.

While the other options could also present with intra-axial lesions, the specific imaging findings and clinical improvement with steroid treatment are more consistent with melanoma metastasis. For example, lymphoma typically presents with iso- to hypo-intense signal on T1-weighted images, meningioma is usually extra-axial, intracranial lipoma is rare and has a specific fat signal on MRI, and non-small cell lung cancer metastasis does not typically present with high signal intensity on T1-weighted imaging.",C,,

This is because a disc prolapse is an extrusion of the nucleus pulposus of the intervertebral disc into the spinal canal, which is located in the extradural space. A gadolinium-enhanced MRI scan will show increased contrast in the area of the disc prolapse, indicating an enhancing extradural mass.",1,,B,TRUE,"I chose option 5 because a recurrent L5/S1 disc prolapse would be indicated by a non-enhancing extradural mass at the L5/S1 level on T1-weighted MRI images. This is because disc prolapses are typically extradural (outside the dura mater, which is the outermost layer of the meninges surrounding the spinal cord) and non-enhancing, as they do not take up gadolinium contrast. Intradural masses (options 2, 3, and 4) are less likely to be associated with a disc prolapse, and an enhancing mass (option 1) would suggest a different pathology, such as an infection or tumor.",A,,
11,0,"A 56 year old man presents with ataxia and cough headaches. His symptoms increase in severity over three weeks. He stopped smoking five years ago and uses alcohol in moderation.

Furthermore, the symptoms described are consistent with those associated with cerebellar haemangioblastoma.",2,,B,FALSE,"I chose option 2, cerebellar haemangioblastoma, because the patient's clinical presentation and imaging findings are consistent with this diagnosis. The patient's age, symptoms (ataxia and cough headaches), and the CT scan findings (solitary 3 cm intra-axial rim enhancing mass in the left cerebellar hemisphere) are more suggestive of a cerebellar haemangioblastoma than the other options. 

Glioblastoma multiforme (option 1) typically presents with rapid neurological deterioration and is more common in the cerebral hemispheres. Ependymoma (option 3) is more common in children and usually occurs near the ventricular system. Medulloblastoma (option 4) is also more common in children and typically presents with symptoms of increased intracranial pressure. Metastatic carcinoma (option 5) is a possibility, but the patient's history of stopping smoking five years ago and using alcohol in moderation makes it less likely.
